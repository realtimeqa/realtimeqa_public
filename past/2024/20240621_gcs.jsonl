And as prices continue to rise, millions of Europeans have had to turn down their thermostats. “If previously natural gas was cheap and plentiful, it is now scarce and expensive,” said Yahoo! Finance.\n\nThe European wholesale reference price used to go up and down a little, but would generally gravitate towards a price of around €20 (£17) per megawatt hour, the site explained. This year, it hit €300 before settling back down to €100.\n\n“It’s the most chaotic time I’ve witnessed in all of those years,” Graham Freedman, a European gas analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told AFP.\n\nBritain’s deal with the US, meanwhile, has the “immediate goal” of stabilising global energy markets, while simultaneously trying to help shift the world towards renewables.\n\nThis will involve promoting nuclear energy as both safe and reliable, and promoting investment in clean hydrogen energy, offshore wind and carbon capture.\n\nIt comes as Britain’s trade minister Greg Hands begins a tour of the US to try to boost trade ties at state level after Brexit. Such deals are “far less ambitious than the transatlantic free trade deal touted by Brexiteers as a major benefit of leaving the EU”, said The Independent.\n\nWhat next?\n\nIn a report entitled Never Too Early to Prepare for Next Winter: Europe’s Gas Balance for 2023-2024, the IEA noted that Europe is only safe this year because Russian gas pipelines had still been flowing throughout the summer, and due to LNG imports from China, neither of which may be repeated in 2023. “This raises the risk of a supply-demand gap of as much as 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) during the key summer period for refilling gas storage in 2023,” the agency warned.\n\n“We are ringing the alarm bells for the European government and for the European Commission for next year,” IEA head Fatih Birol told journalists when presenting the report.\n\nBut while Europe faces a few challenging years, the real loser is Russia, Birol said. Before launching its invasion of Ukraine in February, Russia was the world’s largest gas exporter.\n\n“Is Russia winning the energy battle? The answer is absolutely no,” Birol said, adding: “Russia will not be able to replace Europe just like that – it will take ages. Russia’s role in the international energy system will be much diminished.”\n\nIf there is one positive from the global energy crisis, it is that it has triggered “unprecedented momentum” behind renewables, said the IEA. The world is set to add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the past 20, the agency noted, which could just help “keep alive the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5°C”.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Scott Hocker", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/06/19/the-latest-jail-house-review-of-brazils-world-cup-form/36164885/", "title": "The Latest: Salah scores, but Russia beats Egypt for 2nd win", "text": "AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — The Latest on Tuesday at the World Cup (all times local):\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nRussia scored three goals in 15 minutes early in the second half to set up a 3-1 win over Egypt that moved the host nation to the brink of the World Cup's knockout stage on Tuesday.\n\nMohamed Salah won and converted a penalty for a consolation goal on his return from injury but Egypt's first World Cup in 28 years could be over in barely five days after a second straight loss.\n\nAhmed Fathi poked the ball into his own net — for the fifth own-goal of the tournament already — to put Russia ahead in the 47th. Then Denis Cheryshev and Artyom Dzyuba scored in quick succession to leave Russia on course for a victory that followed up a 5-0 opening-night win over Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt was Cheryshev's third goal of the World Cup, putting him tied with Cristiano Ronaldo atop the scoring charts.\n\nRussia's place in the round of 16 will be sealed if Uruguay wins or draws against the Saudis on Wednesday. Those two scenarios would also eliminate Egypt, which started with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay.\n\n___\n\n10:46 p.m.\n\nSepp Blatter says England should host the World Cup again, ideally in a joint bid with British neighbors.\n\nThe former FIFA president tells The Associated Press \"one day the World Cup should go back for England, definitely. But they will not be alone.\"\n\nThere has been speculation a three-nation British bid for the 2030 World Cup could follow the United States-Canada-Mexico hosting of the 2026 edition.\n\nUEFA wants to present a single European project in the contest. South America is proposing a three-way bid by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\nEngland, the 1966 host, Scotland and Wales already have the required 14 stadiums for a 48-team tournament.\n\nBlatter says: \"I think with three there is a better chance.\"\n\nStill, he asks: \"And what about Northern Ireland?\" Its 18,000-capacity stadium in Belfast is too small for the World Cup.\n\n— AP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar reported from Moscow.\n\n___\n\n10:39 p.m.\n\nMohamed Salah has scored from the penalty spot to reduce Russia's lead over Egypt to 3-1.\n\nSalah, playing for the first time since he injured his shoulder at last month's Champions League final, kissed the ball before hitting it into the top-right corner in the 73rd minute for Egypt's first World Cup goal in 28 years.\n\nSalah won the penalty when he brought down by Roman Zobnin on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nThe referee initially gave a free kick but video review convinced him that the foul occurred inside the penalty area.\n\n___\n\n10:23 p.m.\n\nGoals from Denis Cheryshev and Artyom Dzyuba have given Russia a 3-0 lead over Egypt in St. Petersburg and have the hosts cruising toward the knockout stages.\n\nVillarreal winger Cheryshev scored his third goal of the tournament in the 59th minute off a low cross from Mario Fernandes at the byline. That puts Cheryshev level with Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo as the highest scorers of the tournament, though Ronaldo has played only one game.\n\nDzyuba made it 3-0 just three minutes later, controlling the ball on his chest and beating Ali Gabr before knocking the ball past Mohamed Elshanawy in the Egyptian goal. Dzyuba saluted the fans in celebration.\n\nIf Russia can beat Egypt, the host nation will be all but assured of reaching the knockout stages.\n\n— Associated Press writer James Ellingworth reported from St. Petersburg.\n\n___\n\n10:12 p.m.\n\nEgypt captain Ahmed Fathi's own goal has given Russia a 1-0 lead in the 47th minute in St. Petersburg.\n\nFathi sprawled to intercept a pass from Roman Zobnin and stumbled, the ball coming off his knee and rolling past the outstretched goalkeeper Mohamed Elshanawy.\n\nIt's the fifth own goal of this year's World Cup — tied for second-most all-time in a single World Cup despite it still being the first week of the tournament. Five were also scored in 2014, and six were scored in 1998.\n\nIt was the second own goal of the day after Poland's Thiago Cionek put the ball into his team's goal against Senegal.\n\n— Associated Press writer James Ellingworth reported from St. Petersburg.\n\n___\n\n9:48 p.m.\n\nRussia and Egypt are goalless at halftime in their World Cup game in St. Petersburg.\n\nRussia came close to scoring when Denis Cheryshev blazed a shot narrowly over the bar, while Mahmoud \"Trezeguet\" Hassan and the returning Mohamed Salah shot wide for Egypt.\n\nSalah is playing for the first time since he injured his shoulder tangling with Sergio Ramos in last month's Champions League final.\n\nWith thousands of cheering Egyptians in the St. Petersburg Stadium, the game has felt at times more like a home game for Egypt than for Russia, whose fans ended the half chanting \"we need a goal.\"\n\nIf Russia can earn its second victory of the World Cup, it would be on the verge of qualifying for the knockout stages.\n\n— Associated Press writer James Ellingworth reported from St. Petersburg.\n\n___\n\n8:17 p.m.\n\nTunisia goalkeeper Moez Hassen has been ruled out of the World Cup after dislocating his left shoulder in the team's 2-1 loss to England on Monday night.\n\nThe team posted the injury update on Twitter, saying Hassen was the \"victim of a dislocation\" and the injury was \"very bad news for Tunisia.\"\n\nHassen collided with England's Jesse Lingard in the 5th minute in the match at Volgograd. But he remained on the field and even pulled off a fine save — clawing away John Stones' header from Ashley Young's corner — before Harry Kane scored the opening goal for England.\n\nHassen was forced off in the 15th and replaced by Ben Mustapha.\n\nThe Tunisia squad has returned to its World Cup training base in Moscow to prepare for Saturday's Group G game against Belgium.\n\n___\n\n8:05 p.m.\n\nSuspended former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has arrived in Moscow for a World Cup visit at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBlatter posed for photographs with people on his arrival at a five-star hotel downtown. The 82-year-old former FIFA president is banned from official football duty until October 2021 for financial misconduct during this 17-year rule.\n\nThis is Blatter's first public appearance outside his native Switzerland since July 2015 when the World Cup qualifying draw was conducted in St. Petersburg.\n\nBlatter shared the stage that day with Putin and could meet with the Russian president this week.\n\nThe FIFA ban does not prevent Blatter attending games and he is expected to see Portugal play Morocco on Wednesday at Luzhniki Stadium.\n\n___\n\n7:58 p.m.\n\nSenegal has beaten Poland 2-1 to become the first African team to win at this World Cup. Senegal got a first-half own goal and a controversial second-half score by Mbaye Niang, who returned to the field from treatment and raced to intercept a backpass to Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga, back in soccer's showcase for the first time since 2002, went ahead in the 37th minute when Thiago Cionek's attempted clearance of Idrissa Gueye's shot wrong-footed Szczesny. Niang doubled the lead in the 60th.\n\nGrzegorz Krychowiak's, whose backpass led to Senegal's second goal, headed in a free kick in the 86th minute to end Poland's streak of five straight scoreless World Cup openers.\n\n____\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nEgypt's lineup against Russia is unchanged except for one highly anticipated change: the return of Mohamed Salah in attack.\n\nThe Premier League's top scorer adds some much-needed bite to an Egyptian attack that struggled to threaten Uruguay in a 1-0 loss Friday.\n\nSalah damaged ligaments in his left shoulder when he tangled with Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos during last month's Champions League final playing for Liverpool.\n\nOn the other side, Russia winger Denis Cheryshev has promoted to the starting lineup after scoring twice as a substitute in Thursday's tournament-opening 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe lineups:\n\nEgypt: Mohamed Elshenawy, Ali Gabr, Ahmed Hegazy, Mohamed Abdelshafy, Ahmed Fathi, Tarek Hamed, Mohamed Elneny, Abdalla Said, Mohamed Salah, Mahmoud Hassan, Marwan Mohsen.\n\nRussia: Igor Akinfeev, Mario Fernandes, Ilya Kutepov, Sergei Ignashevich, Denis Cheryshev, Yuri Gazinsky, Fyodor Smolov, Roman Zobnin, Alexander Golovin, Yuri Zhirkov, Alexander Samedov.\n\n___\n\n7:38 p.m.\n\nSenegal has scored again to take a 2-0 lead against Poland midway through the second half in Moscow.\n\nMbaye Niang rolled the ball into an empty net in the 60th minute after cutting between a Polish defender and onrushing goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny to collect a long pass down the middle.\n\nNiang had gone off with an injury moments earlier and was allowed back onto the pitch at midfield just in time to outrace the fullback to the ball. Szczesny spotted the danger before his fullback saw it and raced out of his box but couldn't get there before Niang.\n\nSenegal seized the lead in the first half on an own goal by defender Thiago Cionek. He was attempting to block a shot from Idrissa Gueye but deflected it into the net. Szczesny had no chance.\n\n___\n\n6:54 p.m.\n\nSenegal leads Poland 1-0 at halftime in its return to the World Cup after a 37th-minute own goal by defender Thiago Cionek.\n\nMbaye Niang went around Lukasz Piszczek on the flank following a restart and centered to Sadio Mane. The Senegal midfielder passed to Idrissa Gueye, who sent a right-foot shot from the arc toward Wojciech Szczesny's far post. Cionek, near the penalty spot, lifted his right leg and deflected the ball past a wrong-footed Szczesny.\n\nIn a half of few chances, Senegal outshot Poland 5-2, and the Poles had a slight possession edge. Both teams seemed nervous at the start in Senegal's first World Cup match since 2002 and Poland's first since 1996.\n\n____\n\n6:34 p.m.\n\nColombian singer Maluma has had about $800,000 worth of watches and other personal items stolen from his Moscow hotel while on a trip to support the Colombian team in the World Cup.\n\nRussian news reports are quoting police as saying the items included numerous pieces of jewelry and other belongings. They said a thief apparently got into Maluma's room posing as his guest while the singer was absent.\n\nThe losses were estimated at more than 50 million rubles (some $800,000). An official probe is under way.\n\nMaluma traveled to Saransk on Tuesday where Japan beat Colombia 2-1.\n\n___\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nWorld Cup games have attracted this year's highest television audiences in Russia and Britain.\n\nFIFA says 18.05 million viewers watched Russia's 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia live on Channel One in the World Cup opener. The audience does not include \"digital streaming or out-of-home viewing.\"\n\nA peak audience of 18.3 million in Britain watched England's 2-1 win over Tunisia on Monday, the BBC says — exceeding the numbers for last month's royal wedding.\n\nThe British public broadcaster says it got a record total of 3 million requests to stream the game on its website and apps.\n\nThe British audience topped the Russian figures despite having less than half the population.\n\nThe most intense viewing figure was in Iceland for its World Cup debut. Iceland's 1-1 draw with Argentina drew 99.6 percent of viewers who were watching TV on Saturday afternoon in the Nordic island.\n\nThe Argentina-Iceland game also had an average audience in China of 44.74 million viewers on CCTV5.\n\n____\n\n5:55 p.m.\n\nNeymar has left Brazil's training session limping because of pain in his right ankle.\n\nThe Brazilian federation quickly moved to play down the extent of the injury, however, saying it was just a precaution and the player would be back at practice on Wednesday.\n\nThe federation says Neymar had been in pain since the team's 1-1 opener against Switzerland, when he was constantly fouled.\n\nNeymar limped as he walked away from the field in Sochi toward the dressing room, accompanied by a team doctor.\n\n___\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nThe first member of Japan's royal family to visit Russia in more than a century got to witness an historic World Cup result.\n\nPrincess Hisako of Takamada was at Mordovia Arena in Saransk on Tuesday to see Japan beat Colombia 2-1. It was the first time a team from Asia has beaten a South American opponent at a soccer World Cup.\n\nPrincess Hisako will stay through June 26 and is expected to attend Japan's two other group-stage matches against Senegal and Poland.\n\nHer visit is the first such trip by a Japanese royal since 1916.\n\nRussia and Japan have been locked in a territorial disagreement over four disputed islands, which the Soviet Union took at the end of World War II. It has kept the two nations from signing a peace treaty formally ending their hostilities.\n\n___\n\n5:27 p.m.\n\nWojciech Szczesny was picked to start in goal over fellow Arsenal castoff Lukasz Fabianski as Poland returned to the World Cup for the first time in 12 years and opened against Senegal.

Referee Damir Skomina of Slovenia made the decision after Sanchez stuck out his arm to stop a shot that looked bound for the Colombian net at the Mordovia Arena in Saransk.\n\nShinji Kagawa converted the penalty to give Japan the lead, but 10-men Colombia leveled the score in the 39th minute with a free kick by Juan Quintero .\n\nThe quickest red card record still belongs to Uruguay's Jose Batista in the 1986 World Cup. He was sent off a minute into a goalless draw against Scotland for a harsh tackle on Gordon Strachan.\n\n— Associated Press writer Mauricio Savarese reported from Saransk.\n\n___\n\n3:47 p.m.\n\nIt's 1-1 in the World Cup game between Colombia and Japan after a dramatic first half. Japan defied expectations by taking an early lead over vaunted Colombia, which managed to equalize in the 39th despite being a man down since the opening three minutes.\n\nJuan Quintero's rolling but well-place free kick from just outside the penalty area sneaked inside the post, just past the outstretched hand of diving Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima.\n\nJapan had the lead before six minutes had elapsed, thanks to a defensive breakdown that gave Japan two promising shots on goal.\n\nDavid Ospina blocked the first while charging out of the net, taking him out of position for the rebound.\n\nCarlos Sanchez tried to block the second, but committed a hand ball in the penalty area. Slovenian referee Damir Skomina did not hesitate to pull out a red card, meaning Sanchez was out for the remainder of Colombia's World Cup opener and its next game against Poland.\n\nJapan capitalized on Shinji Kagawa's penalty shot, slotted cleanly inside the right post.\n\n___\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nThe first red card of the tournament has been awarded against Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez for handling a goal-bound shot in the area in the third minute against Japan.

One television cameraman removed his trousers and waded through the water in his underwear while filming. A hotel staff member also had to get through the water to retrieve possessions from his parked car.\n\nNizhny Novgorod, about 400 milometers (250 miles) east of Moscow, will host four group games, one round-of-16 game and a quarterfinal at the World Cup.

After more than half a year, our national crisis appears to be building toward some sort of climax, a swelling crescendo that was topped off by Trump’s flabbergasting news conference Tuesday afternoon in Trump Tower.\n\n\n\nWhat strikes one first about Trump’s remarks is the absence of rationality, of any attempt to connect means to ends. The normal question one might ask of a politician’s pronouncements is: What was he trying to accomplish, what ball was he seeking to advance toward what goal? Here such a line of inquiry makes no sense. Instead of purpose and positioning and strategy, we were witnessing — and not for the first time — a volcanic eruption, a lava flow of anger.\n\n\n\nThe explosion should not come entirely as a surprise. After all, the view from the White House these days is bleak. Trump boasts incessantly, as he did at this news conference, of his economic accomplishments: record unemployment and a soaring stock market. Whatever credit he does or does not deserve for those developments is irrelevant. What is highly relevant is special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which has begun digging into Trump’s family finances, where there is dirt aplenty. What is just as relevant are opinion polls, which Trump dwells on obsessively, showing his standing at a record low. The walls are closing in on him.\n\n\n\nMore:Donald Trump Jr. and the whiff of treason: Morally, he's in deep.\n\nMore:Donald Trump's equivocation emboldens alt-right terrorists in Charlottesville and beyond\n\nCharlottesville added combustible ingredients to the dismal picture. Just as Trump has shown an unaccountable unwillingness to criticize Vladimir Putin, he has shown the same unwillingness, not quite so unaccountable, to single out and challenge the hardcore right. We saw the most vivid example of this in the campaign when, following David Duke’s endorsement of his candidacy, he refused to disavow it, affecting falsely not to know who the white supremacist leader was.\n\n\n\nYet in Charlottesville here they were again, the very people he evidently conceives of as a core element of his base, carrying torches, chanting “blood and soil,” adorning themselves with swastikas, running riot and allegedly committing murder. Trump came under enormous pressure to criticize them. And then, when he declined to do so in a full-throated way, pinning blame for the violence instead on “many sides,” he came under intense criticism for being mealy-mouthed. Forty-eight hours later, by the time he succumbed to the pleas of his desperate advisers and agreed to read from the teleprompter the words they told him the nation was waiting to hear, it was too late.\n\n\n\nThe result, for Trump, was the worst of all worlds. He meant not a syllable of what he had said and was being slammed for it all the same. Republican politicians were now joining Democrats in castigating him. Even worse, a growing list of CEOs of megacompanies were bidding adieu to his vaunted manufacturing council, adding cutting public farewell notes for his maximum embarrassment.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday at Trump Tower, we saw all these crosscurrents converge. The result was a rant that made even his advisers visibly cringe. Trump effectively retracted the words he had struggled not to say on Saturday. He showered praise on the fanatical racist losers who invaded Charlottesville.\n\n\n\nMore:Charlottesville rage: Blacks have better reasons to be angry, 350 years of them\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nTo be sure, some of them were “bad,” he said, using his characteristic infantile vocabulary. But many others were “fine people,” with a perfectly valid permit, “protesting very quietly” against the “the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.”\n\n\n\nGiven such ardor in defense of racists, the question naturally arises: Is Donald Trump a racist himself? From the Judge Gonzalo Curiel affair to the Central Park Five to his illegal practices as a New York landlord, there is a wealth of evidence. The question, however, ultimately revolves around an unknowable grasp of what is in his heart. My own view is that Trump might not be a racist and might well be something worse.\n\n\n\nConsider that to those injured in the murderous rampage that killed Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Trump tweeted “best regards.” Consider also that at the Trump Tower presser, Trump focused on how Heyer’s grieving mother went on social media and wrote “the nicest things” about him and “thanked me for what I said.”\n\nWho chooses such odd words to say such peculiar things about such sensitive subjects? These utterances suggest a person lacking in empathy, a person incapable of feeling anyone’s pain but his own. They are hardly the only and certainly not the most egregious examples of their kind.\n\n\n\nRecall Trump’s cruel mocking of a disabled reporter. Recall Trump’s attacks on Khizr Khan, who had to bury a son who died fighting for our country. Asked by George Stephanopoulos to compare that terrible sacrifice with his own, Trump responded: \"I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. ... I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've had tremendous success.”\n\n\n\nRacists are all too human. They are propelled by hatred based upon a set of perverted core beliefs. Trump’s rage over Charlottesville has nothing to do with a particular set of beliefs about race or anything else. And it has nothing to do with hatred. It has everything to do with something else.\n\n\n\nAs the head of a family business in New York, luxuriating in his inherited millions or billions, Trump could live in a fantasy world of infallibility and invulnerability. In the White House, that fantasy world is repeatedly being punctured. For the first time the entire world is seeing — he himself is seeing — how severely limited he is.\n\nBelieving in nothing but his own greatness, concerned with no one but himself and the extensions of himself who are his children, the man we watched boiling over in Trump Tower, the president of the United States, the man who boasts “I’ve had tremendous success,” is a solipsist whose defective self is being inexorably destroyed as it falls under the relentless scrutiny that attends public life in our democracy.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY’s Board of Contributors and the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law, was a senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign.

Rushmore ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDown 2-1, with the Boston crowd howling and baying, Stephen Curry painted his Mona Lisa.\n\nLike Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, it was comprised of soft strokes of the finest details and, in the end, was beautiful.\n\nCurry’s legacy as one of the sport’s greats has long been cemented, but he’s never been one to be caught standing still.\n\nDespite everything stacked against him in Game 4 of the NBA Finals – a foot injury, his teammates struggling and the type of pressure us mere mortals can’t even comprehend – Curry produced arguably one of the best games of his career (and there are many to pick from), torching the Boston Celtics for 43 points and leveling the Finals in the process.\n\nEven after a career of multiple titles, multiple Most Valuable Awards and multiple All-NBA First teams, the star point guard is still showing why he’s a transcendent figure in the sport.\n\n“He wasn’t letting us lose. That’s all it boils down to. I could tell in his demeanor,” Curry’s longtime Warriors teammate, Draymond Green, said after the Game 4 victory.\n\nOn Thursday, the Warriors clinched the 2022 NBA title with victory over the Celtics in Game 6 of the Finals, securing Curry yet another ring and his legacy as an all-time great.\n\nThe title is his fourth in eight seasons but is arguably the 34-year-old’s most impressive and – with his first Finals MVP award – cements his legacy as one of the 10 best players in league history among esteemed company.\n\n“What they gonna say now?” Curry told Andscape’s Marc Spears after the game. “(You) hear all the talk about you as a player and us as a team, nobody outside of the Bay Area thought we would be here last October when the season started. Me as a player, obviously this Finals MVP stuff and all that, knew (we were) good enough to win three championships before.\n\n“But to have the opportunity to go for a fourth (championship), and to accomplish this goal, too, God is great,” Curry said about the Bill Russell trophy. “Just happy I got to do it.”\n\nCurry breaks down in tears after defeating the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals. Adam Glanzman/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nChanging the game\n\nSince joining the league in 2009, Curry has almost single-handedly changed the way basketball is played. Teams are now increasingly prioritizing their three-point shooting, while prospective NBA players arrive in the draft with well formed long-range shooting.\n\nBut for Curry, the master of the craft, he showed against the Celtics – the league’s No. 2 defense – why he is still the paragon for the three-point, flowing offense that the Warriors and head coach Steve Kerr have become so famous for.\n\nUnlike in other heliocentric offenses – Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks, for example – Curry doesn’t have the ball in his hands every possession, but don’t be fooled, the Dubs’ offense all works because of Curry.\n\nHe is the Sun in the Warriors’ solar system offense. His teammates revolve around his offensive threat, opening spaces even though he may not even have the ball and yet, even with all defenses slated towards him, such is his threat, Curry still finds ways to score.\n\nGreen hugs Curry prior to Game 1 against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2022 Western Conference Finals. Harry How/Getty Images\n\nAlthough his NBA record run of 233 games with at least one three-pointer came to an end in Game 5, just his presence on the court is enough to terrify defenders.\n\nNot content with remaining in one position on the floor, Curry can often been spotted sprinting around without the ball attempting to relocate to a spot where he can get a shot off. And this motion, and the accurate passing of Green, has brought about not only huge successes for the Warriors, but it has transformed the league.\n\nFor the Warriors’ core – Curry, Green, Klay Thompson and head coach Steve Kerr – it’s their fourth title and, arguably, their most impressive.\n\nAndre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Curry pose for a photo after defeating the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals. Adam Glanzman/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\n‘I do not want to be writing this’\n\nNovember 19, 2020, brought the news Warriors fans didn’t want to hear.\n\nThompson, the second half of the prolific “Splash Brothers,” had torn his Achilles tendon, ending his 2020-21 season. “I do not want to be writing this. My soul is in Brooklyn taking a pre-game nap,” Thompson wrote on his Instagram.\n\nIt would be the second season in a row that the star shooting guard would be missing, having torn his left ACL in Game 6 of the 2019 Finals.\n\nIn the two seasons that he missed, the Warriors went 54-83, including missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012. Between injuries to Curry and Green and the passing sands of time, it looked like the unthinkable might be happening: the Warriors dynasty could be coming to a screeching halt.\n\nHowever, like the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs sides that Kerr played for, the Warriors rebuilt.\n\nThrough some savvy transactions and shrewd draft picks, the previously bare-looking core was suddenly surrounded by a heap of talented and skilled energetic players.\n\nWith the return of Thompson and the accession of some of the youngsters, such as Jordan Poole, the team has made an improbable return to the Finals, leaving a cast of All-Stars in their wake.\n\nBut, without the offensive magnetism Curry provides, maybe it would never have happened.\n\nCurry shoots the ball against the Celtics during Game 5 of the 2022 NBA Finals. Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nLegacy\n\nFor someone who has transformed the NBA so comprehensively, the past two months have been a clinic for Curry.\n\nHe averaged over 27 points and approximately five rebounds and six assists while consistently being the focus of the league’s most stout defenses.\n\nAnd although he’s certainly one of the league’s greatest players, given the uniqueness and success of his style of play, this 2021-22 season has been the icing on his future Hall of Fame career.\n\nWhile he’s still a way off the league record for championship rings – Bill Russell has a remarkable 11 from the legendary Boston Celtics team of the 1950s and 1960s – he has now drawn level with such luminaries as LeBron James, Shaquille O’Neal and Robert Parish on four titles.\n\nThe argument about who is in the top 10 NBA players of all time has gone on for years and will go on for many more.\n\nBut, such was his impact in the playoffs and the season as a whole, Curry should be placed amongst those elite names.\n\n“Expanding the Mount Rushmore … is the only conversation that should be going around about Stephen Wardell Curry. Sincerely Dwyane Wade,” the three-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat wrote on Instagram.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs All-Star point guard Dejounte Murray also praised Curry after Thursday’s victory. “We Won’t Never See Anything Like Curry EVER Again. Appreciate His GREATNESS Why We Can!!! #Top10EVER,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nDespite having an illustrious career before this season, with three championship titles and two league MVP awards to his name, this year’s triumph might be his crowning jewel.\n\nHall of Fame point guard Isiah Thomas said that Curry’s Finals MVP “helps” his legacy.\n\n“As (Boston’s) Cedric Maxwell said to me the other night, he goes: ‘There’s 32 NBA Finals (MVPs). I’m one of them,’” Thomas told ESPN.\n\n“I’m one of them, too. At the end, it does matter. It helps. Steph’s legacy is already cemented, in terms of what he’s done for the game, how he’s improved the game, and what he’s done making all the kids want to play the game (the way he does). He’s pushed the game forward.”\n\nCurry raises the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Award after defeating the Celtics in Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals. Elsa/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nCurry joined some esteemed company with his Thursday night haul. Before Game 6, only five players had four rings, multiple league MVP awards and a finals MVP: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan.\n\nNow, there are six players with Curry.\n\nJordan and James are, by consensus, the two best players in NBA history. But could Curry be No. 3? Is Curry the league’s greatest ever point guard?\n\nThey are not crazy suggestions to make – and they’re conversations that will begun to be had.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/sport/year-in-sport-review-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "The year in sport: A fond farewell for some, a glimpse of the future for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn athlete, former jockey AP McCoy said earlier this year, is the only person who dies twice, such is the pain of walking away from the intoxicating, all-consuming nature of professional sport.\n\nMcCoy retired from his long, decorated racing career in 2015, and since then has had to learn, in his own words, how to “start again and have another life.”\n\nBased on the past 12 months, there are some notable sports stars who might have been listening extra closely to McCoy’s experience of retirement – or indeed to anyone else who has spoken candidly about the difficulty of ending a successful sporting career.\n\nAmong them is Roger Federer, who called time on his trophy-laden tennis career at the Laver Cup in September after years spent trying to recover from two knee surgeries.\n\nIn the letter announcing his retirement, Federer, like McCoy, alluded to the heightened emotions of being a professional athlete and how they make saying goodbye so hard.\n\n“I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all I have felt incredibly alive,” Federer wrote. “To the game of tennis,” he signed off the letter, “I love you and will never leave you.”\n\nAnd it's goodbye from Roger Federer ... Julian Finney/Getty Images for Laver Cup\n\nThose final words were reassuring for fans who have admired Federer’s career for so many years, but also spoke to another issue: namely, of how hard it can be to walk away entirely from professional sport after retirement.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how Federer will remain involved in tennis moving forward, and the same can be said of Serena Williams, who announced she would “evolve away from tennis” ahead of this year’s US Open – but refused to say she was retiring.\n\nOn several occasions over the past three months, the 23-time grand slam champion has even teased fans about a potential return to tennis.\n\nAt the 2022 US Open, Serena Williams lost to Australian Ajla Tomlijanovic in the third round. Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nLengthening careers\n\nWhile Federer and Williams have stepped away from their careers as two of the greatest athletes of all time, other sports stars can’t seem to decide when, or how, to walk away.\n\nHeavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury has yo-yoed in and out of retirement this year, saying in October that he’s finding it “really hard to let this thing go.”\n\nAnd earlier this year, Tom Brady announced he would be retiring from the NFL, leaving the sport as a seven-time Super Bowl champion and arguably the greatest quarterback of all time. the 45-year-old then reversed that decision and is still breaking records with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during his 23rd season in the NFL.\n\nHowever in September, Brady and Gisele Bündchen announced they were to divorce after 13 years of marriage.\n\n“I think there is a lot of professionals in life that go through things that they deal with at work and they deal with at home,” the Bucs quarterback said on his weekly podcast a few days the couple’s divorce announcement.\n\n“Obviously, the good news is it’s a very amicable situation, and I’m really focused on two things: taking care of my family, and certainly my children, and secondly doing the best job I can to win football games. That’s what professionals do.”\n\nTom Brady flip-flopped on retiring. Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nBrady has redefined what most believed to be the average shelf-life of an athlete, and he’s not the only person refusing to let the light dim on his career.\n\nLeBron James is about to turn 38 but is still setting records in the NBA – in February passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most combined regular season and postseason points in NBA history.\n\nFederer’s rivals Rafael Nadal, 36, and Novak Djokovic, 35, meanwhile, have added to their grand slam tallies this year – the Mallorcan at the Australian Open and French Open, where he became the oldest men’s singles champion, and the Serbian at Wimbledon. Djokovic’s Wimbledon triumph moved him to within one grand slam title of Nadal’s men’s record of 22.\n\nHaving been deported from Australia over his vaccination status at the start of the year, Djokovic is set to compete at the Australian Open at the start of 2023 – a tournament he has won on nine previous occasions and is favorite to win again next year off the back of his recent ATP Finals victory.\n\nFor Nadal, his future in the sport rests on the amount of strain his injury-ravaged body can continue to withstand.\n\nIn golf, Tiger Woods faces similar questions. The 15-time major champion completed a stunning return from serious leg injuries suffered in a car crash at this year’s Masters, scoring a remarkable one-under 71 at Augusta National before making the cut the following day.\n\nThen there’s sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who turns 36 later this month but has shown no signs of slowing down. The Jamaican produced a string of consistently fast performances this year, running under 10.7 seconds for the 100 meters a record seven times and claiming her fifth world championship title over the distance in July.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce celebrates winning the women's 100m final at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, in July. Carmen Mandato/Getty Images\n\nAnd it’s not just athletes who have defied the call of retirement this year. In November, 73-year-old Dusty Baker became the oldest ever manager to win the World Series when he guided the Houston Astros to a 4-2 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nFamiliar faces and future stars\n\nMany of the athletes who stole the headlines in 2022 have been doing so for years.\n\nNo one is sure where an aging Cristiano Ronaldo will play his club football in January after ending his second spell at Manchester United in ignominious fashion, but the 37-year-old still appears to be set on extending his playing career after Portugal’s quarterfinal exit from the World Cup.\n\nHis rival Lionel Messi, meanwhile, ended the year on a sensational high, guiding Argentina to a third World Cup trophy. The 35-year-old Messi scored twice in an absorbing final against France and finally got his hands on the World Cup at the fifth time of asking, further staking his claim as the game’s greatest ever player.\n\nThat hasn’t been the only recent instance of an established superstar winning silverware. In last season’s NBA Finals, Steph Curry guided the Golden State Warriors to a fourth championship title in eight seasons – in the process picking up his first Finals MVP award as the Warriors beat the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn baseball, meanwhile, Aaron Judge enjoyed a season for the ages. The 30-year-old outfielder, who has reportedly just signed a nine-year, $360 million deal with the New York Yankees, hit 62 home runs last season, breaking Roger Maris’ single-season American League (AL) home run record from 1961.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Yankees named Judge, the reigning AL MVP, as the 16th captain in the franchise’s history.\n\nJudge (left) hit a record-breaking 62 home runs last season. New York Yankees/Getty Images\n\nBut even as familiar faces have continued to shine, the past year has also seen future stars emerge.\n\nThe 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz ends the year as the youngest No. 1 in the history of the men’s tennis having triumphed at the US Open, and in the women’s game, Iga Swiatek, who rose to No. 1 in the world following Ashleigh Barty’s decision to retire after winning the Australian Open, looks set to dominate for years to come.\n\nThis year, the 21-year-old Swiatek won her second grand slam title at the French Open – which came in the middle of a 37-match winning streak – and her third at the US Open.\n\nIn Formula One, Max Verstappen has cemented his position as the best driver in the sport, comfortably defending his world title with four races to spare, while Erling Haaland, regarded as one of the best strikers in European football, has been scoring goals at a record-breaking rate during his first season at Manchester City.\n\nThere was no stopping Max Verstappen this year. Dan Istitene/Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nAt the Winter Olympics in Beijing, then-18-year-old freestyle skier Eileen Gu stole the headlines, winning two gold medals and a silver for the host nation; she also became the first freestyle skier to earn three medals at a single Olympics.\n\nAnother teenager, figure skater Kamila Valieva, had a memorable Games for different reasons. The 16-year-old tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication, in December 2021, but the result didn’t come to light until Valieva was already in Beijing and had won gold in the figure skating team event.\n\nIn that competition, she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump – which involves four spins in the air – at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe outcome from the positive test remains unresolved, and in November, the World Anti-Doping Agency referred Valieva’s case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after deeming the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had made no progress.\n\nEileen Gu performs a trick during the women's freestyle freeski halfpipe final at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Lars Baron/Getty Images\n\nDefending Ukraine\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has cast a shadow over much of this year’s sporting calendar.\n\nAthletes and teams from Russia and Belarus were banned from competitions across various sports, including qualification games for this year’s World Cup and participation at Wimbledon.\n\nThe decision from Wimbledon was perhaps the strongest stance taken by a sports organization, resulting in the ATP and WTA Tours removing ranking points from this year’s tournament.\n\nAt the start of the war, many Ukrainian athletes – like skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych and MMA fighter Yaroslav Amosov – opted to put their careers on hold and support the country’s military efforts.\n\nBoxer Oleksandr Usyk has also spoken passionately about serving his country, and in the ring has extended his undefeated record, beating Anthony Joshua in August to retain his WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles.\n\nOleksandr Usyk lands a punch on Anthony Joshua during their \"Rage on the Red Sea\" heavyweight title fight at King Abdullah Sports City Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nThroughout 2022, sport and geopolitics have been closely entwined. This month, WNBA star Brittney Griner returned home to the US having been detained in Russia for nearly 10 months on drug smuggling charges.\n\nDespite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nThe 32-year-old’s arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin which played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nShe was released in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\nBrittney Griner is seen getting off a plane in an undated photo posted to her Instagram. Miguel Negron/US Army South\n\nNew competitions in new regions\n\nPerhaps no sport has been as gripped by internal politics this year as much as golf, which was rocked by the launch of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series in June.\n\nLIV Golf has been criticized by some of the game’s leading players – including Woods and Rory McIlroy – while others – major champions Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson – have abandoned the PGA Tour in favor of the lucrative, breakaway series.\n\nIt has left the sport divided. Earlier this year, LIV Golf joined an antitrust lawsuit alongside some of its players, alleging that the PGA Tour threatened to place lifetime bans on players who participate in the LIV Golf series.\n\nThe suit also alleges that the PGA Tour has threatened sponsors, vendors, and agents to coerce players into abandoning opportunities to play in LIV Golf events.\n\nThe PGA Tour filed a countersuit in late September, claiming “tortious interference with the Tour’s contracts with its members.”\n\nThe LIV Golf series is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) – a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nLIV Golf’s launch is part of Saudi Arabia’s wider ambition to host and invest in global sports events. This year, it staged the rematch between Usyk and Joshua and even won a bid to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games.\n\nBut unquestionably, the most prominent sporting event held in the Gulf region this year has been the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe four-week-long tournament came to a thrilling conclusion on Sunday as Argentina lifted the trophy, bringing down the curtain on what FIFA president Gianni Infantino argued was the greatest World Cup of all time.\n\nThere were upsets, high-scoring games, and brilliant goals throughout – right up to Sunday’s showpiece when Messi reigned supreme and Kylian Mbappé scored a stunning hat-trick in a losing cause.\n\nThe match between Argentina and France at Qatar 2022 is being viewed as the greatest ever World Cup final. Buda Mendes/Getty Images\n\nIt was the first time a country in the Middle East had hosted the World Cup, and Qatar, which has a population of just three million people, invested billions of dollars in building seven new stadiums, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThe tournament was also fraught with controversy, particularly when it came to allegations surrounding the country’s poor human rights record and treatment of migrant workers.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers in Qatar have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nIn the face of such criticism, Qatar has maintained it is an open, tolerant country and has seen the World Cup as a vehicle to accelerate labor reforms.\n\nStadium tragedies\n\nElsewhere in international football, England won the Women’s European Championships for the first time in front of a record crowd on home soil, while Senegal claimed the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title in February, also for the first time.\n\nOutside international competitions, Real Madrid won its 14th European crown by defeating Liverpool in the Champions League final – a game that was marred by security issues.\n\nReal Madrid defeated Liverpool in this year's Champions League final in Paris. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nThe match itself was delayed by more than 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the Stade de France and tear gas was used by French police towards supporters held in tightly packed areas.\n\nParis police chief Didier Lallement admitted in June that the chaos was “obviously a failure” and said he takes “full responsibility for police management” of the event.\n\nTragically, football has witnessed multiple serious stadium disasters this year. In October, more than 130 people were killed in a stampede in the Indonesian city of Malang – one of the world’s deadliest stadium disasters of all time.\n\nIndonesia’s President Joko Widodo later said the country would demolish and rebuild the stadium, vowing to “thoroughly transform” the sport in the football-mad nation.\n\nPlayers and officials from Arema Football Club gather to pray on the pitch for victims of the stampede at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang.

This narrative should not exist for one simple reason: The Palace of Auburn Hills should not exist — at least not in the way we have come to know it.\n\nThe Palace should have been an abject failure, run into the ground by ambitious but well-intentioned people who, truth be told, really didn’t know what they were doing. It should be an abandoned site. A mushy, ruinous pit. A parking lot overgrown with weeds. A crumbling structure, or perhaps one already done in by the wrecking ball. A faded memory and the subject of our ridicule and scorn.\n\n“Oh, that?” we might tell the kids in the backseat as we whiz past the Lapeer Road exit on I-75. “That used to be where the Pistons played.

Like an ingénue who burst onto the scene and has kept her good looks while growing old with grace and poise, the Palace should be celebrated for the rich life it has lived heading into its final Pistons game tonight.\n\nSure, it has been home to the Pistons, who launched the stadium with a bang by winning NBA championships in their first two seasons there. Michael Jackson and Barbra Streisand performed there. Ron Artest brawled there. Gordie Howe skated his last shift there.\n\nBut we can’t forget about the building itself. We shouldn’t say farewell without remembering that, long ago, this structure set a shining example of what a sports arena should be. It’s an architectural triumph that has been copied the world over.\n\nThe funny thing is that it never should have turned out this well. Tom Wilson, the former longtime Pistons president and chief executive who was in charge of the whole project more than 30 years ago, conceded that “we had an architect that had never designed a (stadium), a builder who had never built one and a developer who’d probably been to one sporting event in his life. So that mix, you talk about destined to fail, that mix has no chance to pull this thing off.”\n\nSo why didn’t it fail?\n\nThe short answer: Bill Davidson. The long answer: The Pistons’ late owner was smart enough to know what he didn’t know.\n\n“I think part of his genius was letting other people do it,” Wilson said. “He said, ‘At my age, I don’t know anything about this business. I don’t want to learn it. I’m going to count on you guys to sort of get it done.’ He turned it over to us, and we had a very small team of people.”\n\nDetroit Pistons' Palace good-bye tonight just seems right\n\nZeke and the pirates\n\nWhen Davidson bought the Pistons from original owner Fred Zollner in 1974, the team played at 11,000-seat Cobo Arena in downtown Detroit.\n\n“At Cobo, you were coming to the games with the same 5,000 intimate friends that you had every night,” said Mike Abdenour, the Pistons’ director of team operations who started as the team trainer in 1975. “Cobo was unique from the standpoint that it had its own vibe.\n\n“The fashion show always began at the six-minute mark of the first quarter: Who was walking into the building and sitting in those very expensive $7 courtside seats at the time. It was like a place to be seen.”\n\nBut not for much longer. Davidson moved the Pistons in 1978 to the gargantuan Pontiac Silverdome, which seated 80,311.\n\n“And then I think Mr. Davidson’s vision was, you know, it’s got to be a little bit better,” Abdenour said. “And to his credit and a lot of guts on his part, moving to the Silverdome, that was a strong move because now you’re in a literally vast expanse. We weren’t necessarily treated like second-class citizens because the Lions were the main focus.\n\n“But it’s amazing. When we started winning, when we started bringing bodies into that place, the feeling of second-class citizenship kind of went away. Not that we were co-equals with the Lions, but we knew what was happening 41 times a year when things were starting to really, really get good.”\n\nAnd the crowds were getting really, really big. The Pistons drafted Isiah Thomas with the second overall pick in 1981, launching the Bad Boy era as attendance climbed each year.\n\nRelated:\n\nBut for all the Silverdome’s size, it restricted the Pistons’ business potential. The city of Pontiac owned the building, which meant the Pistons were mere tenants — and not even the main tenants, thanks to the Detroit Lions.\n\nAfter leaving Ft. Wayne, Ind., in 1957, the Pistons had gone from Olympia to Cobo to the Silverdome and, because of a fateful snowstorm, briefly Joe Louis Arena. And the Pistons still hadn’t owned their own home in Detroit after nearly three decades.\n\nThomas offered possibly the most politic and artful answer when asked if the Silverdome had ever felt like home.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said with a chuckle. “That was part of the Bad Boys’ mystique as pirates. Every place, we made it our house.”\n\nThe perfect storm\n\nOn March 4, 1985, a snowstorm brought down the roof of the Silverdome and gave rise to an idea that would inspire the Palace.\n\nWhile the roof was being repaired, the Pistons were forced to play their final 15 games of their season at Joe Louis Arena.\n\nDuring one game, Wilson walked around the Joe’s concourse with John Ciszewski, a sales executive with the Pistons. Wilson asked Ciszewski a question that changed the sports world forever.\n\n“You know what I don’t understand?” Wilson asked. “Why don’t people put suites here as opposed to putting them way up in the rafters? I mean, these people are paying premium dollars. Why don’t you let them see the event? Why don’t we look at it differently?”\n\nThere is simply no way to overstate the importance of Wilson’s simple question. What his question led to was, in the world of sports arenas, no less significant than Isaac Newton getting clonked on the head by an apple.\n\nBut before the concourse-level suites came, the Pistons needed an arena. The next question Davidson and Wilson had to ask themselves was, “What kind of arena do we want?”\n\nNothing mediocre\n\nYou have to remember that when the Pistons started thinking about building the Palace, arenas largely were publicly funded money pits. They also were cheaply built, ugly, unimaginative blocks of cement — much like what the Sacramento Kings devised when they built Arco Arena, which they managed to make worse recently by renaming it Sleep Train Arena.\n\n“So we were really looking, when we sat down, at copying what Sacramento had done,” Wilson said. “They built a really kind of low-end arena for $10 million to $15 million. We thought, well, if we spend 20 to 25 (million), we should be able to build a nice place. And that would be fine.\n\n“And Mr. Davidson didn’t want to build anything mediocre. He said, ‘If we’re going to do it, let’s do it and let’s figure out how to make it work.’ ”\n\nDavidson and Wilson didn’t have any grand plans to build a cutting-edge stadium. He actually had a rather simple directive.\n\n“What was really important to Bill was that he have a home for his basketball team,” Wilson said. “Like a really, really nice home for his basketball team. And that was the biggest driver for him.”\n\nHis basketball team wasn’t disappointed.\n\n“It was our house,” said former forward Rick Mahorn. “It was something that started from ownership. Bill Davidson had the vision of saying, ‘OK, I’m tired of being a renter. I’m going to own something and build a brand.’ ”\n\nDavidson also was smart enough to hire good people, trust them and stay out of their way.\n\n“And the great thing about Bill,” Wilson recalled, “is he said, ‘I don’t know anything about arenas. So you guys design it. The only thing I ask is that you design it in such a way that you’re not coming back and asking me for a check every two months because we couldn’t make it work.’\n\n“So what that led us to do was sort of completely change the industry, because in those days arenas were just money pits.”\n\nThe millions mount\n\nThe original budget, Wilson said, was $50 million. That still would have put the Palace in line with some of the nicer arenas that were being built at the time, like the Charlotte Coliseum and Miami Arena.\n\nBut $50 million was an early estimate that accounted for just 100 suites: 52 on the club level that started at Row 16 and 48 more suites nine rows up. And, as anyone who has ever remodeled their house knows, final costs rarely end up resembling an estimate.\n\nSkybox suites added another $10 million to $15 million. One of the first versions of the Jumbotron was used and soon things seem to get better everywhere in the stadium during planning.\n\n“So we just upgraded everything as we went along,” Wilson said. “Better restaurant, better facility, better everything. And with each change, the price got a little higher, but the building got a little better. And we promised when we kind of came out of the block, this is going to be the finest building that you’ve ever seen. And I don’t think we failed.”\n\nThe Palace wound up costing $80 million, Wilson said. Some estimates peg the number closer to $90 million.\n\nThe bank of Davidson\n\nDavidson, along with fellow investors Bob Sosnick and David Hermelin, chose to privately finance the Palace for two reasons: Control and expedience.\n\n“I think from Bill’s standpoint he was very much the kind of person that he just didn’t want to answer to anybody else,” Wilson said. “If there was a problem, he just wanted to fix it. He didn’t want to go to boards, he didn’t want to report to somebody, he didn’t want a process to take months and months and months. He just wanted to fix things.”\n\nA good example that demonstrated the wisdom in this choice was the problem with having only about 10 entrance and exit lanes when the Palace opened.\n\n“We couldn’t get people in, we couldn’t get people out,” Wilson said. “So the first games we had with the Pistons were a disaster. So we knew we had to change them.”\n\nInstead of meeting with a zoning board, the Pistons approached Auburn Hills mayor Bob Grusnick, who told the Pistons not to worry about obtaining a permit. By the time the team got back from a West Coach trip, more lanes had been added and a permit was soon secured.\n\nHey, it was the ’80s. Auburn Hills had barely become an incorporated city in 1983. So, yes, this is how things were done.\n\nA vision ... on 10 cases of beer\n\nHaving a friendly partner who could fast-track permits wasn’t the only advantage the Pistons had by putting their arena in Auburn Hills.\n\n“You look at how difficult it is in a major city to get things done,” Wilson said. “There’s always restrictions and there are always historical problems and things like that and issues. And we called Bob Grusnick, who was the mayor out there. We’d just done renderings of the building. We hadn’t run this by anybody. Everything was being done in a clandestine manner.\n\n“We said, ‘We’d like to show you what we’re thinking of doing in your city.’\n\n“So they didn’t have any city offices. He said, ‘Come on out to my place of business.’ So we did. And his place of business was a party store. And we went to the back of the party store and on 10 cases of beer we unrolled the renderings of what would become the Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\n“And he sort of said, ‘Geez, I love this. Let’s make it happen. Call my assistant.’ ”\n\nWith help from Grusnick and the city, things moved quickly. The Pistons announced their plans to build the arena on June 6, 1986, and broke ground that summer. Two years later, it opened.\n\n“Very little red tape, or at least they made the red tape kind of a soft pink,” Wilson said. “And we were able to move quicker than you were able to move maybe anywhere. Certainly in any major American city it would have taken a lot longer: Years of negotiations and things like that.”\n\nThe suite sweet life\n\nDavid Richards is a soft-spoken man. He is quiet and careful with his words, which makes it seem like he’s telling you a secret. And in a way he is as he stands over a thick book of original blueprints for the Palace.\n\nRichards is the chief operating officer for Rossetti, the architecture firm in Detroit that designed the Palace. Richards was closely involved with the project and as he flipped through the thick book at Rossetti’s downtown offices, he seemed to recall something about every blueprint. He explained a part of the stands that lift up.\n\n“We call it an elephant door,” he said, “specifically so an elephant and a rider can get in and out of the building during the circus.”\n\nThe seats were an important focus of the design.\n\n“We made the individual rows wider than pretty much every other building,” he said. “We wanted to establish a new standard so that there’s a little bit more leg room.\n\n“The use of the padded seats is something that is, once again, a unique sort of thing. Many, many buildings had the plastic-shell seats. A lot of building were still built with benches.”\n\nRichards flipped through the book and found the blueprint he wanted. For all intents and purposes, it may as well be a modern-day Rosetta Stone for stadiums, a key for unlocking the secret, hidden riches every arena contained but that no one realized.\n\n“If you want to talk about things that had not been done before,” Richards said, “the Palace did some very, very unique things. I think probably the one that’s most well-known is putting suites in Row 16, and absolutely the first to do that. The first to bring those right down to the sweetest part of the building, and something that’s proven to be very, very popular and something virtually every building now tries to do. We didn’t know you couldn’t do it, and we found a way.”\n\nWilson’s nascent idea for the lower-level suites in March 1985 eventually became a mandate.\n\n“A year or two later,” Wilson said, “when we decided to go forward, that’s really when we said, ‘Look, we’ve got to be able to put them on the concourse. There’s got to be some way to do that.’ ”\n\nWilson said Rossetti, to its credit, pushed back initially because the lower suites would create a lot of problems, such as changing sight lines. But Wilson pushed right back. Rossetti had never designed an arena, but neither had Wilson. It was an entirely theoretical argument, until Wilson whipped out a napkin and drew a rough sketch of what he was thinking. Napkin scribbles are one thing. Architectural schematics are another. But it was a start.\n\nThen the breakthrough happened. Wilson and Richards were part of a group that went on a fact-finding tour of newer stadiums. Neither Wilson nor Richards could recall the actual arena where it happened, but they remembered they were all sitting together.\n\n“We’d been on tour and we began to take a break,” Richards said. “We’re sitting at about Row 16. And that’s where somebody said, ‘Why can’t we have a suite right here?’ And I think it may have been (firm founder) Gino Rossetti. It may have been Tom Wilson. It may have been everybody at once saying, ‘If we’re going to put in suites, let’s put them right here. It’s the best place in the building. Why wouldn’t somebody that had that feature, that amenity, want the best?’ ”\n\nEveryone began to see the same picture from the same place.\n\n“Then they went away and came back a week later,” Wilson said, “and said, ‘You know what? I think this can work. If you want to do it, it’s expensive, but I think it can work.’ ”\n\nRossetti’s idea was to integrate the lower-level suites as seamlessly as it could into the design of the arena in a way that would satisfy form and function.\n\n“We did this with the intent that the seating bowl looks continuous and it felt continuous,” Richards said. “We did it specifically so that we didn’t have a vertical wall of glass reflecting concert sound back and around. We had people seated in front of (the suite) that were absorbing sound, rather than it reflected. So the sound was better in the building.”\n\nThe concession to design Rossetti made was to create a step up from the suites to the actual seats. In modern design, concourse suites jut out conspicuously. But the Palace’s club-level suites are set back and tucked underneath the upper-level seats to retain the aesthetic of a bowl and only the seats protrude into the arena.\n\n“It really makes it feel like a unified experience,” Richards said, “like everyone’s there together sharing that experience.”\n\nWhen it was done, the Palace had 52 lower-level suites that started at Row 16. It had 48 more suites that started at Row 25. And it had another 80 skybox suites. Wilson went to each level of the suites and took a look. The vision was complete and it was astounding, even to the man who first saw it. He knew that he and Davidson and Rossetti and the whole team had built more than great new suites. They had created a new world.\n\n“You just knew the world was going to change when you saw this and when you sat in them and you compared them,” Wilson said. “You go to the 16 rows. Then you go to the (25th row suites). The (25th row) looks pretty good. But then you go to the top and you realize that’s where the world was and now this is the where the world is going.\n\n“It was just like you just bought a suite for the best seat in the house, literally the best seat in the house. I don’t think there was any question the arena world would never be the same. And that’s proven to be the case.”\n\nTough sell\n\nOf course, the lower-level suites would have meant nothing if the Pistons couldn’t sell them. So, how do you sell something no one has ever seen or heard of before?\n\n“All the family shows signed 10-year deals to play downtown,” Wilson said. “So the ice shows, the circuses all stayed downtown. So you’re selling suites to what? You’re selling it to a dream or a hope or a vision — and the Pistons. And that’s all you had.”\n\nNot quite. The Palace also had Wilson, with his determination, his silver-tongued salesman’s pitch, and his intestinal fortitude.\n\n“We made a list of 40 or 50 people that would be good prospects for suites and probably when the dust settled five of them bought,” he said. “So we were out scrambling trying to sell a new idea and a new concept to a whole new audience that had never had suites before or had entertained the way we were telling them they could entertain.”\n\nAnd that was the good news.\n\n“Remember, we were building this when interest rates were 17-18%, so it was costing a fortune,” Wilson said. “In addition to being a crazy idea, we were also doing it at the worst conceivable time economically in the country. It was really going against the wind.”\n\nWhen Wilson and his sales team got the first domino to fall, the rest soon followed.\n\n“There were automotive coatings and there were seven companies that made them,” Wilson said. “And we got turned down by six of them. We were calling everybody.\n\n“We went to, I think it was Akzo at the time. They were the last one and they agreed to buy. So we went back to the top of the list. You call up DuPont and you say, ‘Would you be interested in looking at a suite?’\n\n\"‘No. We already said no.’\n\n\"‘Well, let me tell you what Akzo’s doing with theirs.’\n\n\"‘Oh, Akzo’s got one?’\"\n\nAnd so it went. Once they had Akzo, they had DuPont. Once they had Akzo and DuPont, they had everyone.\n\n“Eventually all seven or eight of them bought; different levels, different prices and everything like that,” Wilson said. “But they couldn’t let somebody get a leg up.”\n\nThe suites were doing their job and generating the influx of money the Palace needed to cover it debt and ensure financial success.\n\n“In our case,” Wilson said, “we had 52 suites down there paying premium prices, in those days. Just the dollars that were generated from that alone could cover most of your debt service, or a lot of your debt service.”\n\nNBA approval for Pistons move downtown could come in July\n\nThe name game\n\nYou may have heard the story of how the Pistons named the Palace. They held a competition for fans to suggest names and received about 100,000 entries. About 1,600 suggested the Palace.\n\nThe Pistons planned to announce the winning arena name on live television during halftime of their game against the Boston Celtics at the Silverdome on Dec. 4, 1987. They also randomly picked five people who had suggested the Palace for a drawing for lifetime tickets to every event at the Palace, which Jonathan Binder, a 20-year-old Michigan student from Flint, won.\n\nBut that’s just part of the story. Two of the key parts of the Palace’s name were decided by Davidson and the city. It was actually Davidson who picked the name from the fans’ suggestions.\n\n“He loved the Palace,” Wilson said, “because it brought great memories of being in New York and playing the Palace was always the greatest thing in the early, early days in vaudeville. So he thought it was a magical name.”\n\nAs for the “of Auburn Hills” part of the name, that was a concession.\n\n“That was the one thing they insisted on and that was sort of our give,” Wilson said. “But they were amazing to work with.”\n\nThe Palace of Auburn Hills was jeered from the start. Maybe the fans just didn’t realize it could have been so much worse with something like the Sleeping Train Palace of Guaranteed Rate.\n\nGrand opening\n\nThe Palace opened with Sting’s concert on Aug. 13, 1988. But there was no question from the outset who the main tenant was.\n\nThe Pistons finally had a home and Rossetti wanted the outside of the building to make a simple, geometric statement about that fact, even if it was a subtle one.\n\n“I know you’ve seen it a thousand times,” Richards said with a smile, “and it never occurred to you.”\n\nThe building’s exterior design is a basketball going through a hoop. If you look closely, the crisscross pattern of the brown bricks gets smaller at the bottom to suggest the narrowing of the net and a ball moving through it.\n\nRossetti gave lots of thought into the fan experience. The firm designed more extensive women’s restrooms. It padded every seat to absorb sound and greatly improve acoustics, especially for concerts. They also put in a cutting-edge perforated metal deck in the roof to absorb even more sound.\n\nEven though basketball would rule the arena, the acoustic improvement — especially after coming from the Silverdome — was extremely important for fans and for luring music acts like Sting, and Michael Jackson, who sold out three performances that October.\n\n“I remember going in we kept telling everybody, ‘This is going to be the best acoustics in any building anywhere,’ ” Wilson said. “And you’re kind of hoping it’s true because you’ve been saying it for so long.\n\n“And I walked in, they were setting up for Sting, which was the opening show on Aug. 13, and I went out to the sound guy and said, ‘OK, just curious. Tell me about the building.’ And he said, ‘I knew the minute I walked into the building you had fabric seats and that this going to be a different experience. This is the finest place I’ve ever been.’ And then you just sort of smile and think, ‘Gee, we told the truth.’ ”\n\nThe funny thing is that the Palace almost missed its opening night. Rossetti had designed an equipment grid that could be lowered from the roof to within 10 feet of the ground. It eliminated the need for riggers to affix lights and tresses from dangerous heights. But Sting’s riggers weren’t familiar or comfortable with the grid.\n\n“Sting’s riggers determined it was unsafe and they were about to cancel the show,” Richards said. “Finally I’m in a room and I had to take personal responsibility for the safety of Sting on the stage. I told them, ‘I’m personally responsible for him.’ Which is just silly because especially then, personally, it didn’t amount to much. I even offered: ‘I’ll go on stage with you.’ He was wise enough that he didn’t need that.”\n\nThese boys weren't bad\n\nFor all of the Pistons’ itinerant excellence at the Silverdome and elsewhere, they had no trouble settling in and feeling right at home right away when they played their first home game at the Palace, when they opened with a 94-85 win over the Charlotte Hornets on their way to an 8-0 start and, of course, the franchise’s first NBA championship that season.\n\n“It was a big part of the Pistons’ identity,” Thomas said, “and a part of my identity in terms of an arena being associated with a certain team and a certain player. It was our house, and we treated it that way. This was ours. This was our palace. This was our house. This was our building.\n\n“And even our fans felt that way, in terms of there were signs that were put up there that said, ‘This is our house.’ We took pride in not losing in our house.”\n\nThe Bad Boys were well on their way to being good before they arrived at the Palace. But when they got their own home, a strong identity and culture was formed around the team and its fans.\n\n“It was always fun just because the fans appreciated what we did,” Mahorn said. “And when you win and fans appreciated that you embodied what Detroit was all about, hard work, it was always fun.\"\n\nAbdenour recalls those heady early days when the Palace was equal parts basketball and party atmosphere. There was a “Flamingo Suite,” which used fishing line to send Styrofoam cutouts of players dressed in jersey to another suite called Rodman’s Roost, which would unfurl a 20-foot banner in honor of the rebounding machine known as Dennis Rodman.\n\n“That became part of the fabric of the whole organization,” Abdenour said of the arena’s carnival atmosphere. “That became part of what that group was all about and that became part of what the Palace was all about.”\n\nThe Bad Boys won back-to-back titles in ’89 and ’90, but both championships were clinched on the road. The organization had a clever consolation by offering Palace Vision. When the Pistons played their NBA Finals games on the road, fans could pay $2 for a ticket to watch the game on the stadium’s video boards.\n\nDiane Ferranti, the Pistons’ longtime vice president of game operations, was the director of Palace Vision during her first season working for the Pistons in 1988-89.\n\n“And literally you could not get a ticket,” she said. “There were 22,000 people packed into that arena to watch it on the video board. It was absolutely insane. I don’t think we ever anticipated that 22,000 people are going to show up to watch it on TV in the building, but they did.”\n\nHome or away, it didn’t matter to Thomas. It’s hard to believe any player wouldn’t want to win a title in front of his fans.\n\nBut it’s almost believable to hear Thomas, famous for his pugilistic tenacity, say he preferred to spoil someone else’s day.\n\n“It went along with our mystique,” Thomas said, glee in his voice. “We wanted to beat you in your building and celebrate in front of your fans. That was kind of who we were.”\n\nThomas said he still feels like he’s part of Detroit, part of the family when we returns. He started as a pirate and then became a pioneer. These days, he’s just proud to have been a Piston who played in his Palace.\n\n“It was truly the model for how a small-market franchise can be successful in the NBA and the Palace being one of the most decorated and innovative buildings at that time when it came out,” he said. “Everything from the arena to the pride in playing to the way we traveled to the hotels that we stayed in and the team that we had, it was a pioneering team and a pioneering palace.”\n\nGoin' to work, winning at home\n\nThe Bad Boys won their titles in Los Angeles in ’89 and in Portland in ’90. It would take an unlikely group of non-superstars, known as the Goin' to Work group, to finally win the championship at home in 2004.\n\nThe Goin' to Work team was famous for its collective strength and forward Tayshaun Prince, while speaking of the team itself easily could have been speaking about the entire organization, whose entire game operations staff adopted the Goin' to Work attitude.\n\n“The way that the team was built and the way that we did things, they always said that it wasn’t a one-person show,” Prince said. “We all did it together. We all had to do our part to achieve big things.\n\n“Obviously wonderful memories in this building, wonderful memories on the road. But definitely, definitely will miss being in this place, being in this arena. The most important thing is we did special things in here, and we will never forget it.”\n\nChauncey Billups, the heart of the team and the 2004 NBA Finals MVP, was optimistic about the team’s impeding move downtown to Little Caesars Arena, and maybe even a touch jealous that the never got to play in Detroit. But nothing, he said, would ever replace the Palace.\n\n“We all know my and the rest of my teammates’ affinity for the Palace,” Billups said. “It’s a special place for us. It breaks my heart that it’s closing and going away.”\n\nBefore there was a Palace or even a Silverdome, Wilson was a kid growing up on Six Mile in Detroit. He took the Woodward bus to watch the Pistons play at Cobo. So the first championship in ’89 was a moment of transcendence. But as the leader of an organization, Wilson felt something different with the “magic of winning at home” in 2004, when the Pistons beat the mighty Lakers with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.\n\n“I just remember looking around the roped-off area and seeing so many of our staff with tears in their eyes because they’d all worked hard,” he said. “We’ve been down for a few years and then you come back slowly and then to sort of celebrate the unlikely. We did beat a team with four Hall of Famers starting for them.”\n\nGordie's last shift\n\nThere were plenty of wonderful moments at the Palace.\n\nThe Detroit Shock went from being the WNBA’s worst team in 2002 to winning the first of three championships in 2003.\n\n“Biggest memory was ’03,” said former Shock player Cheryl Ford, “when I came in and the team went from worst to first. And the crowds, our fans here, we had standing room only, and it was the best feeling ever.”\n\nThere’s one event that stands out for its historical implications, even if it was a publicity stunt to its fullest. But hey, this is Hockeytown. And Gordie Howe was Mr. Hockey. So who exactly is going to object to Howe lacing them up and taking the ice one last time to become the first person to play hockey professionally in six decades?\n\nNobody, that’s who. And if you disagreed, Mr. Hockey’s elbows would have been happy to end any argument.\n\nSo Howe signed a special contract with the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League and on Oct. 3, 1997, he played his last shift. Howe was 69 and he was on the ice for one shift that lasted 46 seconds at the Palace, where the Vipers played.\n\nFerranti’s job that night was to wait with Howe before the game and cue him to take the ice for his introduction.\n\n“I was a stage manager at the time,” Ferranti said. “So I remember standing in the Zamboni tunnel while they did his introduction and it was literally just Gordie Howe and me, and I was overwhelmed by that.\n\n“And one of our season-ticket holders took a photo of me. It didn’t really sink in till later, but took a photo of me standing there with Gordie in his Vipers uniform looking at me. And it was my job to say, ‘OK, Gordie, it’s time for you to take the ice.’ And I remember being overwhelmed at that moment with just the emotion of it. That was a pretty big moment.”\n\nImagine that. The man who embodied his sport, a giant among the giants of Detroit sports and as beloved a figure as this city has ever seen, and Ferranti got to tell him when it was time to say good-bye. Moments don’t get any bigger.\n\nHow the Detroit Pistons' 'dancing usher' became an icon\n\nThe future\n\nIt has never been easy in Detroit, has it? The hard work, the weather, the factories, the crime, the auto industry, race relations, politics, the recession, you name it. The city has survived it all for 315 years and counting.\n\nBut it has always been hard work. If there’s a secret to why the Palace has remained pristine and a marvel, it’s hard work. The organization, which has spent over $141.5 million in renovations since it opened, has made sure to keep the Palace up. Under Tom Gores’ stewardship alone, since he bought the team in 2011, the Palace has had $40 million in upgrades.\n\n“I’ve always believed our franchise is a community asset,” Gores said in an email to the Free Press. “We all have incredible memories from the Palace going back almost 30 years. We own those as a community, and they are an important part of our history. Those memories will stay with us forever. The success of the arena for so long is a testament to the vision of Bill Davidson and his family. They put their heart and soul into the building and created a place that stood the test of time for nearly three decades.”\n\nSo what happens now? The answer isn’t clear. The Pistons still need formal approval to leave the Palace and move to LCA during a vote at the NBA Board of Governors’ meeting this summer. The arena still will host plenty of big events this year. Bruno Mars will perform in August and the final event scheduled is a Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert Sept. 8.\n\nAfter that, no one knows. The Palace could be torn down, the land sold and redeveloped. Or it could stand, possibly viable with just a handful of events each month.\n\nIf the Palace goes, it will be hard to bid it farewell. For everyone.\n\n“You always want one more good-bye,” Thomas said. “I think all of us as Pistons, regardless of the situation, we never want it to end. Any time any of us get a chance to come back to Detroit in any kind of way, we jump on it. Like, ‘Isiah, will you come make an appearance at this elementary school in Port Huron?’\n\n“Yes! What’s the date?”\n\nBut maybe Thomas, and the rest of us, should let the Palace go.

And then, after a drawn-out, exhaustive two-year wait for the conclusion, we were rewarded with the massive letdown that was Season Eight in 2019, which landed with a dud.

Martin in his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels. A prequel to \"Game of Thrones,\" the series documents the division and fall of the Targaryen dynasty.\n\nWhen Season 1 ended in October 2022, war appeared on the horizon for the Seven Kingdoms when the death of King Viserys I (Paddy Considine) left a power vacuum in Westeros and a question as to his chosen successor. As the second season begins, Westeros is on the brink of a bloody civil war with powerful houses being forced to choose sides.\n\n\"War is coming, and neither of us may win,\" Rhaenyra says – presumably to Aegon – in a trailer HBO released May 14 for the upcoming season.\n\nWatch it here:\n\nMax also released \"dueling trailers\" March 21 asking viewers to pick a side by selecting the color corresponding to a specific council: the Green Council of King Aegon or the Black Council of Queen Rhaenyra.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis British comedy about an all-female, all-Muslim punk rock band is like a warm blast of summer sun on your face just when you thought winter would never end. Deeply funny, especially sweet and always surprising, the series returns for a second season three years after the first without missing a step or joke. The new season sees the Lady Parts band struggling to make an album as a string of bad luck and a rival band threaten to doom their musical dreams. Of course, the songs remain oh-so-catchy and hilarious on top of the witty scripts and perfectly timed performances. There’s no better time to be had this summer.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\n‘The Acolyte’ (Disney+)\n\nJune 4, streaming Tuesdays\n\nIf your idea of a good “Star Wars” story is “all lightsabers all the time,” then “Acolyte” is tailor-made for you. Set about a hundred years before the 1999 prequel film “The Phantom Menace,\" “Acolyte” follows a rogue Jedi student (also known as a Padawan learner) played by Amandla Stenberg, and the chaos she causes for the Jedi order. Chasing her are “Squid Game” star Lee Jung-jae and Carrie Ann Moss, donning robes as they sense a disturbance in the Force. The teaser showed a masked person wielding a red lightsaber, in case you forgot what bad guys in the “Star Wars” universe look like.\n\n‘Clipped’ (Hulu)\n\nJune 4, streaming Tuesdays\n\nIt’s been a decade since the world heard the leaked audio of disgraced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling spewing a racist rant that would lose him his team. That’s enough time for Hollywood to rip the story from the headlines so that Sterling will return to our collective consciousness, played by Ed O’Neil with a constant sneer. “Clipped” is less concerned with creating a detailed minute-by-minute rehash of the NBA’s great controversy than capturing the tone of a racially fraught sports league in crisis. It makes “Clipped” a more engaging rehash of recent history than similar series. The stellar cast is rounded out by Laurence Fishburne as Doc Rivers and Jacki Weaver as Sterling’s wife, Shelly.\n\n‘The Boys’ (Amazon)\n\nJune 13, streaming Thursdays\n\nAre you ready for it? Amazon’s bloody, rip-roaring, irreverent, take-no-prisoners superhero TV show returns for Season 4 in June. Season 3 wasn’t the series’ best work, with some repetitive and frustrating storylines. But here's hoping Season 4 gets a jolt of the Season 1 juice (whether it’s glowing and blue is optional) as our heroes and villains contend with a Supes-targeting virus (which you might recognize if you watched spinoff “Gen V”) and a major election. It’s like 2020 but with more blood spatter. A lot more.\n\n‘House of the Dragon’ (HBO)\n\nJune 16, Sundays, 9 EDT/PDT, and streaming on Max\n\nWe’re done with the hemming and hawing and the time jumps and withering old men. Now it’s war, and that should be exciting. HBO’s “Game of Thrones” spinoff, set a few hundred years before the original series, stumbled around in its 2022 first season that had to cover too much expositional ground (and years in the timeline) without enough action and characterization to keep things interesting. In previews, Season 2 promises more of that good old rage, blood and battles that were such a pivotal part of “Thrones.” It’s Team Black (Rhaenyra and Daemon) versus Team Green (Aegon and Alicent) in Season 2, and the winner gets the Iron Throne (it's their descendants who deal with all the stuff in “Thrones”).\n\n‘The Bear’ (Hulu)\n\nJune 27\n\nYes, chef, I’ll take another order of “The Bear,” please. Everyone’s favorite frenetic restaurant dramedy returns for a third season after absolutely sweeping the Emmys and other major awards this winter. Will it buckle under all that hype? Probably not, considering it’s one of the best-written, best-acted series around. The third season picks up as the new restaurant opens after a bumpy preview at the end of Season 2 that left a screaming Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) stuck in a freezer. Hopefully, he's thawed out by now.\n\n‘Industry’ (HBO)\n\nAug. 11, Sundays, 9 EDT/PDT, and streaming on Max\n\nFollowing a group of the young and hungry vying for wealth and power at a British investment bank, “Industry” may seem dry on the outside, but it’s a juicy meal of melodrama and spectacle on the inside. Season 3 makes money moves, adding Kit Harington (\"Thrones\") as the CEO of a green energy company and Sarah Goldberg (\"Barry\") as a portfolio manager at an “ethical” investment firm.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\n‘Emily in Paris’ (Netflix)\n\nAugust 15 (Part 1)\n\nWhether you love to hate it, hate to love it, or somewhere in-between, get ready for more of Lily Collins’ clueless-American-in-Paris romcom. When we last saw Emily and friends (or her amies) it wasn’t exactly happily ever after under the Eiffel Tower. Camille (Camille Razat) left Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) at the altar and Alfie (Lucien Laviscount) unceremoniously dumped Emily (Collins). Oh, and Camille is pregnant. That’s plenty of drama, ridiculous and petty, to keep Emily occupied for a fourth season (the second part of which arrives Sept. 12).\n\n‘Only Murders in the Building’ (Hulu)\n\nAug. 27, streaming Tuesdays\n\nWith this death rate, someone’s got to check for asbestos in that building. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez return for a fourth murder-mystery go-round in Hulu’s wildly popular comedy. The producers feel the need to up the star power year after year, so for Season 4 Meryl Streep is back, joined by Melissa McCarthy, Molly Shannon, Eva Longoria, Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Kind and Zach Galifianakis. Is there anyone left in Hollywood who hasn’t visited the Arconia yet?\n\n‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ (Amazon)\n\nAug. 29, streaming Thursdays\n\nWelcome to our Hot Sauron era. Season 1 of Amazon’s billion-dollar “Lord of the Rings” prequel ended with quite the reveal in fall 2022 when fans learned that unassuming and shipwrecked Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) was the dark lord Sauron in disguise (the handsome character was quickly dubbed “Hot Sauron” by the internet). With that reveal and the creation of Mount Doom, maybe there will be more fire (literal and figurative) to the new season, which was fun and pretty in Season 1 but never reached the glory or transcendence of Peter Jackson's films.\n\nLooking for reliable options to stream the latest must-see TV shows?

It can change your brain.", "text": "It was only 10 a.m., but Dalton Hessel had been awake for hours caring for his newborn, Mia.\n\nHessel, 28, sat on the couch with his wife, watching their daughter lie on the garden-themed playmat during tummy time. The baby's eyes darted back and forth between the shapes and colors before her attention was finally caught by a carrot dangling in her face.\n\nAs she reached for the soft toy, Mia paused and skillfully rolled over onto her back. Hessel was in awe. He had just witnessed one of her first milestones.\n\nIf it hadn’t been for his eight-week paternity leave, the teacher from Hayward, Wisconsin, would have been going over simple math problems with his second graders at this hour.\n\n“It was such a cool moment,” Hessel said. “Those memories you make and the bond you form during that time is going to be foundational to how you raise your child.”\n\nWhat happened in that moment struck him at his core, as such moments do for many parents, and it turns out something may have also been happening for Hessel on a neurological level. New fathers who spend large chunks of time with their infants experience brain changes (akin to what mothers experience) that better prepare them for fatherhood, according to a growing body of research. The research provides compelling evidence that taking paternity leave could give fathers time to trigger those changes.\n\n“That caregiving experience is what makes the brain changes come online,” said Darby Saxbe, professor of psychology at the University of Southern California. “That’s where the argument of family leaves comes in – if you give (fathers) more opportunities to interact with their infants, you’ll see more of these changes.”\n\nHow a father's brain changes\n\nThere’s a long-held belief that women have an innate, maternal instinct that helps them better adapt to motherhood.\n\nWhether or not that instinct exists, it turns out that fathers may be able to develop this ability, without the same flush of hormones and the experience of pregnancy, by simply spending time with their infant.\n\nSaxbe and her team of researchers studied brain scans of women before conceiving and two months after giving birth and found structural changes in the new mothers’ brains.\n\nPregnancy appeared to affect two parts of the brain: the cortex, or the top layer of the brain, and the subcortex. The cortex is linked to reasoning, thinking and decision-making, and the subcortex is associated with emotional processing.\n\nResearchers also found the women's brains had reduced gray matter, or the middle portion of the brain that connects brain structures, which meant their overall brain volume had been reduced.\n\n“You would think that losing gray matter volume may be a bad thing, but evidence suggests it could be adaptive because it represents streamlining passages (for) faster and more efficient processing,” Saxbe said.\n\nSaxbe’s team at the University of Southern California and their colleagues in Spain’s Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón compared these results with scans from 40 men taken during their partner’s pregnancy and after their baby was 6 months old.\n\nThe scans showed similar brain changes among fathers, changes that were not found in a control group of 17 childless men, according to their findings published in a 2022 issue of the journal Cerebral Cortex.\n\nAlthough the changes were more varied and subtle in men's brains than in women's, the pattern of change was more pronounced among Spanish men, who generally have more generous paternity leave than fathers in the U.S.\n\nSaxbe said fathers who spent more time with their children showed a greater reduction in gray matter.\n\nThe hours a father logged with an infant made the difference, she said: “It seems that time with baby is an important part of remodeling the brain.”\n\nHow brain changes translate to paternal behaviors\n\nSaxbe and her team’s research built upon studies that found similar patterns in mice.\n\nScientists at NYU Langone Medical Center linked certain parental behaviors to brain cells that make a signaling chemical called dopamine, which is known to create feelings of satisfaction, according to a 2018 study published in Neuron.\n\nThe NYU researchers studied female mice and their brain activity as they interacted with their babies, focusing on a region near the front of the brain that's key to retrieval, according to study author Dayu Lin, a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience and physiology at NYU Langone Health.\n\nResearchers found cells in this part of the brain were the most active when mothers located their babies and when they brought them back to the nest. They artificially stimulated these cells in mice that hadn't given birth, and found they retrieved the babies like the mother mice. When researchers blocked this brain activity, both mother and pup-less mice stopped retrieving the little ones.\n\nIn research that has yet to be published, Lin said NYU Langone Health scientists are seeing similar brain activity and pup retrieval behaviors in male mice.\n\n“Our ongoing work suggests that with extensive exposure, (males) can also switch,” she said. “Repeated exposure (to pups) in mice studies is very critical for the emergence as well as the maintenance of parental behaviors.”\n\nPaternity leave in the US\n\nSome fathers say they've experienced this surge of joy the researchers tapped into in brain studies.\n\nKasean Kitson doesn't think his bond with his daughter, Eleanor, would have been the same were it not for the eight weeks of paternity leave he took last year.\n\n\"I don't think I would have had the same relationship with her. ... All the little things, I would have missed so much,\" said Kitson, 32, who lives near Greensboro, North Carolina. \"It’s the happiest I’ve ever been my whole life, not having to worry about anything else except for Eleanor.\"\n\nThe U.S. is one of the few high-income countries that does not uniformly offer paid parental leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees only 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected time off for both parents of a newborn or newly adopted child.\n\nThe federal law applies only to people who work at companies with at least 50 employees. And even if time off is permitted, most new parents can’t afford to give up a steady income for three months. About 66% of people eligible for leave under the act don’t take it because they can’t afford to, according to a 2020 report from Abt Associates, a government and business research and consulting company.\n\nOnly 11 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that ensure paid family and medical leave: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.\n\nNew Hampshire guarantees coverage for state employees and enacted a voluntary law that provides paid leave for private-sector employees who purchase coverage. Vermont has taken a similar approach, but neither of these states guarantees workers a right to paid leave.\n\nIn addition to brain changes, research shows paternity leave can improve relationships between men and their partners, lead to better health and developmental outcomes for children, increase fathers' engagement and bonding, and narrow the gender wage gap by increasing employment and pay opportunities for mothers.\n\nHessel returned to work the first full week of December. Although he missed his second graders, he wouldn’t have traded the time he spent with Mia for anything in the world.\n\nWithout that time, he wouldn't be as confident in interpreting her cry cues: when she needs changing, feeding or burping. Their connection wouldn't have been the same.\n\nIf he could live those months over, he'd take paternity leave without a doubt, he said, because “you don’t get that time back.”\n\nSend tips to Adrianna Rodriguez: adrodriguez@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/health/mother-brain-chelsea-conaboy-wellness/index.html", "title": "Why you are not a failure as a mother | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nHollywood’s version of childbirth bears little resemblance to my experience, or that of anyone else I know. On the screen, we almost always see soon-to-be-moms rushing to the hospital after a dramatic water breaking, a somewhat rare occurrence in real life, after which she howls and curses her way through a speedy labor and delivery. Then, poof, voilà!, her hair magically realigns itself, a healthy level of pigment returns to her cheeks, and she is in love, completely and irrevocably, with her baby.\n\nMy first thought when I saw my oldest child after delivery? You are really cute, but that was really hard, I’m really tired, and yet here we are all alone. Would it be so bad if I had a day or two to recover before you and I started hanging out?\n\nWith my second, I was fortunate enough to be in a hospital that allowed my husband to spend the night in the room with me without any additional cost. He took on most of the care, I got to rest, and nobody expected anything resembling a “Madonna and Child” moment from me.\n\nMy story continued to diverge from the Hollywood version of new motherhood in the weeks and months that followed. There was no love at first sight, but a love-in-process accompanied by a fair amount of anxiety and stress. It took until my kids were about 6 months old for the love to turn on fully, and until my first was about 2 years old for my identity as a mom to feel natural and guided by what we might call instinct.\n\nThrough conversations with other parents, I now know that my deviation from the Hollywood script of new motherhood is not unusual. In fact, it’s the norm. Thankfully, popular culture and scientific research are starting to catch on.\n\nAuthor Chelsea Conaboy talks about the many fictions surrounding the idea of maternal instinct in \"Mother Brain: How Neuroscience is Rewriting the Story of Parenthood\" Julianna Lee\n\nIn her new book, “Mother Brain: How Neuroscience Is Rewriting the Story of Parenthood,” Chelsea Conaboy looks at the new findings surrounding childbirth and early parenthood that present a far more complex picture of the experience. CNN spoke to Conaboy about the many fictions surrounding the idea of maternal instinct, what babies do and do not need from their parents, and how understanding the complexity of the parental brain can make us better parents.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nCNN: What was the story of parenthood that you were told when you became a parent?\n\nChelsea Conaboy: The story that I received about what it means to become a parent was, in some ways, not a story. I felt like it wasn’t ever really talked about in a way that I could reflect on what this change could mean for my internal life and my sense of self. That went hand in hand with my assumptions about maternal instinct, or this idea I would step into this role and know exactly what to do and how to be — because caregiving is innate, automatic and hardwired for females.\n\nThese ideas about maternal instinct, which were written into scientific theory by people invested in a certain moral model of motherhood, weren’t just about how I was supposed to behave but also how I was supposed to feel. It’s not enough to pick up a baby, shush it or know how to swaddle it. I was supposed to have complete devotion, be totally selfless and be able to overcome any fears through the act of nurturing.\n\nCNN: What was your process of discovering this is far from true for many parents?\n\nConaboy: The first “aha” moment began with my own struggles as a new parent. I was really overwhelmed with worry at the time, and so I began looking for answers to describe what I was going through. I started researching maternal anxiety and discovered how much the brain is changed by parenthood. And that is true of all people, and not just people who experience postpartum mood or anxiety disorders.\n\nI hadn’t been given that information in any prenatal education or parenting books, and it could have made a huge difference for me. In fact, it did make a huge difference for me when I finally learned this. It reframed my whole experience. I still had worries about my son’s well-being, but I stopped worrying about the worrying, or thinking there was something wrong with me because I knew that those feelings were all part of a productive process that was happening in my brain and helping me adapt to this role.\n\nCNN: Which findings did you find most compelling among the brain research being done on parents?\n\nConaboy: One is that attention is really the thing our babies need from us, and the changes in our brains really compel us to give them our attention. We get this story that the baby is placed on your chest, and you will be flooded with oxytocin, and the bond will form forever. But you can be attentive to a baby and feel many different ways. You can be filled with anxiety, you can be filled with warmth, or you can be really tired and still give attention.\n\nChelsea Conaboy looks at the new findings surrounding childbirth and early parenthood that present a far more complex picture of the experience. Yoon S. Byun\n\nIn a similar vein, we are taught about attachment, and the formula is often very simple. The bond with a child happens through having a healthy pregnancy, vaginal birth, breastfeeding and then spending a lot of time with a child. But when you look at the science, you see that caregiving can happen in so many different ways. For example, if you don’t breastfeed, it’s not like you are going to miss the window on bonding. There are so many other opportunities to connect.\n\nOne last one. We so often talk about “mommy brain” as being degenerative for women. But new neuroscience research suggests we have been looking at it in the wrong way. Parenthood might have a neuroprotective effect on the brain and slow the effects of aging. The challenges of parenting can keep the brain looking younger.\n\nCNN: In addition to the present research, you also look back at our evolutionary history as a species and how the contemporary maternal ideal is an anomaly.\n\nConaboy: We have a lot to learn from history. We have so accepted this idea of the nuclear family being a foundation of society, but that is not how it always was. Other people always helped with our babies, and those people were not always fathers. Grandmothers played an important role, too.\n\nThis parenting by someone else than the biological parent shaped us as humans, making us more social.\n\nCNN: Does the new science of parenthood tell us about dads?\n\nConaboy: We know that two things shape the parental brain: a major shift in hormones and exposure. Obviously, things are different depending on whether you are the gestational parent or not, but not all different.\n\nMen also have hormonal changes as they approach fatherhood while their partner is pregnant, and after the baby is born, they also have spikes in oxytocin when they interact with their children.\n\nOverall, the research shows that fathers’ brains change in structure and function just like mothers’ brains do, and the more time they spend in direct care, the more dramatic these changes are.\n\nCNN: How did writing this book help you as a parent?\n\nConaboy: The big thing it did for me is helping me have more patience with myself. There are all these parenting books that tell us to trust yourself, but sometimes that is problematic and confusing because when they tell you to trust yourself, it assumes you will know what to do.\n\nWhat I learned to trust is the process and knowing that making mistakes is part of the process, because we, as parents, learn from them. That is not just a trite saying, but as I’ve learned, is part of the biological process of learning to read and respond to our children’s needs so next time we can do better.", "authors": ["Elissa Strauss"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2016/07/06/evidence-grows-povertys-toll-young-brains/86571856/", "title": "Evidence grows of poverty's toll on young brains", "text": "Abigail Becker\n\nWisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism\n\nFive-year-old Naja Tunney’s home is filled with books. Sometimes she will pull them from a bookshelf to read during meals. At bedtime, Naja reads to her 2-year-old sister, Hannah.\n\n“We have books anywhere you sit in the living room,” said their mother, Cheryl Tunney, who curls up with her girls on an oversized green chair to read stories.\n\nNaja and Hannah are beneficiaries of Reach Out and Read, an early intervention literacy program that collaborates with medical care providers to provide free books when families come in for check-ups.\n\n“I learn things that my brain will always know,” Naja said during an appointment at Group Health Cooperative’s Capitol Clinic in Madison.\n\nNaja’s and Hannah’s brains are in critical phases of development, and they are being stimulated by a home environment that prioritizes education.\n\nBut children who do not have this same experience early in life — especially those growing up in poverty — could experience delayed brain development that significantly harms their educational progress, according to recent research by psychology professor Seth Pollak and economist Barbara Wolfe at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nTheir study is part of a growing body of socioeconomic brain research documenting what Joan Luby, a child psychiatry professor at Washington University in St. Louis, calls “poverty’s most insidious damage” — that poor children are up against their own biological development.\n\nAlong with graduate students Nicole Hair and Jamie Hanson, Pollak and Wolfe found that poverty can cause structural changes in areas of the brain associated with school readiness skills.\n\nThese parts of the brain are susceptible to circumstances often present in poor households, including stress, unstable housing, nutritional deficiencies, low academic stimulation and irregular access to health care.\n\nTo isolate the effects of poverty from other factors, the study included mostly children of educated mothers — 85 percent reported at least some college-level education and 22 percent had some graduate-level education. Families with factors that could negatively affect brain development, such as a risky pregnancy or a history of psychiatric problems, were excluded.\n\nThe study examined brain development of 389 mostly white young people ages 4 to 22 with educated mothers. Household income ranged from less than $5,000 to between $100,000 and $150,000. The fathers had similar educational backgrounds.\n\nThe findings suggest that while schools have been the focus of reforms aimed at closing Wisconsin’s long-standing racial and economic achievement gaps, efforts perhaps should start much earlier and be directed at raising income levels of poor children.\n\nAn estimated 28 percent of the state’s children live below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. Pollak found that income bracket — which for a family of four is $36,450 a year or less — was associated with diminished brain development and learning.\n\nIn a 2016 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics calls the amount of child poverty in the United States “unacceptable and detrimental to the health and well-being of children.”\n\nLegislators on both sides of the aisle in Wisconsin are beginning to agree that more needs to be done to help children.\n\nPollak’s study found that as much as 20 percent of the gap in test scores of low-income children is explained by developmental lags in the frontal and temporal lobes — critical areas of the brain responsible for learning, including attention, emotion regulation, processing complex ideas, memory and comprehension. Children below 1.5 times the federal poverty level scored four to eight points lower on two standardized tests than children who were not poor.\n\nThese tests are the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. On both tests, a composite score between 90 and 110 is considered average.\n\nResearchers also found that children from these poor households have less gray matter — 3 to 4 percent below developmental norms for their sex and age. A larger gap of 7 to 10 percent was found in children living below the federal poverty level, $24,300 for a family of four.\n\n“This is suggesting that there is something about a child’s early environment that is affecting the way their neural systems are working that undermine their ability to extract information and succeed in school,” said Pollak, who is also the director of UW-Madison’s Child Emotion Lab.\n\nOther research has shown a connection between early childhood trauma and “toxic stress” on the ability of children to learn.\n\nGaps big in Wisconsin\n\nWisconsin has the largest disparity in the country between the performance of black and white students and the rate at which they graduate. The state also has the highest suspension rates for black high school students in the nation, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism’s Children Left Behind series reported in December. Despite various local and state efforts, the pattern has not changed much over 20 years.\n\nWisconsin also has the second-largest poverty gap in the United States between blacks and whites, a disparity that has grown faster than the national average, according to a December report from the UW-Madison Applied Population Lab.\n\nPollak’s study shows poverty can have biological effects long before children enter the classroom, strengthening the case that efforts to close the achievement gap should begin prior to a child’s first day of school. Given the findings, it is “not really a surprise,” Pollak said, that children from low-income families are doing so poorly.\n\nIn 2013, in an earlier study, a team led by Wolfe and Pollak examined how family poverty can affect the rate of brain growth among young children.\n\nThey found that infants from lower-income families started life with a similar amount of gray matter to infants whose families were not poor. But by their toddler years, poor children had less total gray matter, they found.\n\nSmaller volumes of brain tissue also were tied to greater behavioral problems in the preschool years, the 2013 study found. The effects of poverty on brain size were strongest among the most impoverished children.\n\n“As infants aged — and presumably had increased exposure to the effects of their environments — the differences in brain volume between poor children and those with greater resources widened,” according to the study.\n\nThese studies provide a biomedical explanation for why poor children tend to do worse in school.\n\n“It is the delay of brain development that is accounting for the significant achievement test scores in children living in poverty,” Pollak said. “Now we know that that achievement gap in poverty is at least partially explained by slower brain growth attributed to poverty.”\n\nThe effects of poverty on the brain were concentrated among children from the poorest households, those below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. There was no difference between lower-middle-class children and those from affluent families.\n\n“It’s not like we need to get everybody up to affluence,” Pollak said, “we just need to have kids not living in scarcity.”\n\nStress adds to school woes\n\nWhile researchers now can point to poverty as a cause of developmental brain delays, they do not know what specifically about poverty is changing children’s brains. Pollak theorized it could be the “pervading sense of stress” that can accompany poverty.\n\nThe prolonged activation of stress response systems, known as toxic stress, in a child without the buffer of a stable environment can disrupt brain development and cause other harmful consequences such as increased risk for disease into adulthood, he said.\n\n“It’s that whole atmosphere that is contributing to the way kids sleep, to the stress level, or the regulation level of the way they digest food and the way that they grow,” Pollak said. “And that whole environment taken together, that it is poverty, and that’s what is actually affecting central nervous system development.”\n\nSo-called adverse childhood experiences can rewire a child’s brain in a way that makes it harder to learn, Dr. Bruce Perry told a group of Wisconsin juvenile court and child welfare officials meeting in Wisconsin Dells last fall.\n\nPerry, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University, emphasized that not all stress is bad.\n\n“Stress is what helps you develop. Stress makes you a better musician. Stress makes you a better athlete,” Perry said. “Stress makes you better. It is the pattern of stress that makes all the difference.”\n\nHe explained that if the stress is “moderate” and “controllable,” children can develop successful mechanisms for responding to future, unexpected stresses. But other kinds of stress caused by factors such as violence or neglect in the home can create a state of alarm that makes children more reactive, often described as the fight, flight or freeze response.\n\nWhen presented with new material in school, for example, such children may have a hard time activating the thinking part of the brain.\n\n“If you are a child who is dis-regulated, and you are introduced to the very same challenge that the rest of the class is, you are so overwhelmed that you shut down your cortex completely and your cortex is unable to actually process information,” Perry said.\n\n“And in order to master the same content, you are required to have 10 times the repetition, which is not going to be provided in the typical classroom environment, and you’re going to fall further behind.”\n\nParent, child brains linked\n\nNot only are children’s brains more malleable in early childhood, the brains of new parents are also subject to change, according to a March study from the Aspen Institute, an education and policy studies nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.\n\nNew mothers and fathers experienced structural changes during the first few months after their children’s birth, according to the report, as their newborns’ brains are also developing — emphasizing a need for a two-generation approach to early intervention.\n\n“True two-generation interventions don’t say … the parent is just a route to making the child’s life better,” said Dipesh Navsaria, a UW-Madison associate professor of pediatrics, who was not involved in the study. “The parent and the child both have inherent value, and we should be investing in them both because … that’s where we get an added effect.”\n\nPollak explained that human brains develop structurally in an inside-out pattern. The frontal lobe behind the forehead controls behavior and attention — skills children need in school — and it develops later.\n\n“Because those parts of the brain are very late developing, they might be very vulnerable … because they’re growing a lot while children are encountering or not encountering things in the world,” Pollak said.\n\nChildren’s brains are in a constant state of growth, or plasticity, and they can tolerate a number of adverse experiences before long-term effects are seen, Pollak said. That resiliency means some effects can be reversed.\n\n“It’s just a question of what’s the cost of waiting longer and longer before we do something,” Pollak said.\n\nAs Navsaria explained, it is more difficult to address a speech delay in an 8-year-old than a 3 -year-old, and in a 3-year-old than an 18-month-old.\n\n“The upshot of this is that you have this fantastic opportunity in the first five years of life to wire things right, or if they’re not wired right, to do remediation,” Navsaria said. “If we get it right early on, then we have a better likelihood of a good outcome.”\n\nReading gateway to learning\n\nNavsaria is also the medical director of the Wisconsin branch of the national Reach Out and Read program, which was analyzed as part of the Aspen Institute report. There are about 160 Reach Out and Read programs and 50 clinics in training in Wisconsin.\n\nThe program distributes one book per well-child visit from ages six months to 5 years, for a total of 10 visits. The program costs about $20 per child, said Brian Gallagher, executive director of the national organization based in Boston. Clinics pay for the program through fundraisers, grants or by including it in their budget.\n\nFrancesca Vash, a nurse practitioner at Group Health Cooperative’s Capitol Clinic in Madison, said her patient population includes families who are transient or homeless with little access to books.\n\n“No matter the age of the child, I always talk about the importance of reading,” Vash said.\n\nBy intervening through the health care system, Navsaria said, medical professionals can keep track of children’s development and model reading techniques to parents in a consistent manner.\n\n“I think it changes how people think about (achievement gaps) — that it could be any one of us and it isn’t a moral failing, this isn’t some sort of irresponsibility, this is the effects of children’s brains being under siege,” Navsaria said.\n\n‘Human capital being wasted’\n\nSome experts say early interventions also are more cost-effective than remedial programs in adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nUniversity of Chicago economist James Heckman found it is cheaper to pay for high quality preschool than later interventions such as hiring teachers to create low student-to-teacher ratios, government-funded job training or rehabilitation programs for ex-convicts.\n\nHeckman’s analysis of low-income African-American children who attended the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the 1960s found that every $1 invested returned about $7 to $12 back to society.\n\nInvesting in programs aimed at older individuals is still beneficial, he wrote, although the return is lower.\n\n“Investing in disadvantaged young children is a rare public policy initiative that promotes fairness and social justice and at the same time promotes productivity in the economy and in society at large,” Heckman wrote.\n\nPollak said such research shows the “human cost to the human capital being wasted.”\n\nBipartisan effort to combat poverty\n\nEd Hubbard, an assistant professor of educational psychology and the director of the Educational Neuroscience Lab at UW-Madison, said Pollak’s research should serve as ammunition for policy changes for Republican and Democratic legislators alike.\n\n“These types of data put the ball squarely back in the politicians’ court,” Hubbard said.\n\nThat appears to be happening in Wisconsin. State Sen. Julie Lassa, D-Stevens Point, and Rep. Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, kicked off the bipartisan Legislative Children’s Caucus in April.\n\nLassa said the goal is to advocate for evidence-based public policies that will benefit the state’s children.\n\nTo Lassa, Pollak’s research provides proof that poverty harms children.\n\n“To me, there shouldn’t be any more arguing about the science,” Lassa said.\n\n“I think all together the work that (Pollak) is doing is helping us to bring awareness to the necessity to do more comprehensive help when it comes to children,” Ballweg added.\n\nThe lawmakers said helping children could have long-term economic benefits.\n\nSaid Lassa: “These children are our future workforce, they’re our future leaders. … We need to be making sure that they get the best start possible.”\n\nCap Times reporter Abigail Becker wrote this story while working as an intern at the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism.

While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued. Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her doctors said was caused by stress.\n\nTwo days after the twins were born in 2014, Huff says, the father took a swing at her. He was holding their newborn son. They were still in the hospital. Huff had just delivered by Cesarean section. \"He was so angry at me because my milk wouldn't come in,\" Huff, 39, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe boy was born with \"floppy baby syndrome,\" a muscular condition doctors said might be attributed to abuse during pregnancy. Both children struggle with health issues, including speech disorders, and have spent months in instructional therapy to learn how to follow directions.\n\nThe father denies sexually assaulting or abusing Huff. He was charged last year with assault and battery against her; his lawyer says he completed a pretrial program in September to avoid a conviction. In 2015, a grand jury in Savannah declined to indict him on sexual assault charges.\n\nNew research is giving scientists more insight into the far-reaching and long-lasting harms of domestic violence to the children who grow up around it – including a startling finding: Witnessing abuse carries the same risk of harm to children's mental health and learning as being abused directly.\n\nBrain imaging in infants shows that exposure to domestic violence – even as they are sleeping, or in utero – can reduce parts of the brain, change its overall structure and affect the way its circuits work together.\n\nStudies show that when babies born to mothers who were subjected to violence during pregnancy become adults, they have three times as much inflammation in their bodies as those whose mothers weren't. Inflammation causes a much higher risk of poor health, and a far greater likelihood of depression.\n\nAnd research also shows that these children are as likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as soldiers returning from war.\n\nPsychologist Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, past president of the American Psychological Association's division of trauma psychology, said \"babies are like a blank slate.\"\n\n\"If a mother is beaten while pregnant, there is a chance the baby will be injured, delivered prematurely, and there is a stack of other things that can happen – including physiological programming of the hyperactive stress system that leads to inflammation as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like when a soldier comes back from combat, hears a click and hits the ground.\"\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4.5 million and 15 million children are exposed to physical violence in the home. Verbal and emotional abuse in the home is more difficult to track.\n\nSocial workers, health care providers and academics have long tracked the effects of trauma suffered by children growing up in urban neighborhoods with frequent gunfire and other violence. But outside of medical journals, there has been little reporting on the effect of the more common domestic violence on the millions of children who grow up on the residential battlefields where it occurs.\n\nNeuroscientist Tanja Jovanovic directs the Grady Trauma Project, a research institute based at Emory University in Atlanta. The risk of PTSD from domestic violence is high, she says, because it's a \"betrayal by someone who is supposed to be to a protector.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Jovanovic said, domestic violence often eliminates the \"buffering effect of another positive adult,\" because the adult who is targeted can't provide comfort to the children who witness it.\n\nPsychologist Abigail Gewirtz says domestic violence can feel scarier than war. Gewirtz is the director of the Institute of Translational Research in Children's Mental Health at the University of Minnesota. It's \"one of the most terrifying forms of violence because it happens in a place which is supposed to be safe,\" she said. \"Children are totally powerless, especially very young children. They are totally dependent on their parents.”\n\nRead more:\n\nDomestic violence 'code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\n'Toxic stress' on children can harm their lifelong learning, mental and physical health\n\nExposure also reduces the potential of babies and toddlers to learn. Alissa Huth-Bocks, a child psychologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said the \"most damaging time\" is during pregnancy and the first three years of life, when development \"takes the biggest hit at the brain level.\"\n\nLong-lasting consequences\n\nNegative consequences continue well into adulthood. Among childhood adversities, Ronald Kessler says, those involving family violence inflict the worst long-term effects.\n\nKessler is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the principal investigator of the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey – the first nationally representative survey of mental disorders in the United States. He is co-director of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\n\n\"One of the long-term effects of childhood adversity is that they create emotional scars that get reopened when people are exposed to traumas in adulthood – leading to adult PTSD,\" Kessler said.\n\nFor people of color, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, the effects of trauma are often magnified, federally funded research shows, because they are more likely to suffer from systemic racism, discrimination and microaggressions.\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Child Trends reported last year that 6 percent of kids nationally – about 4.5 million children – had seen or heard parents or other adults slap, hit, kick or punch each other in the home. Four percent had been exposed to or victims of neighborhood violence.\n\nThe results were based on a survey of parents about their children. In five states – Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, Hawaii and Tennessee – at least 10 percent of children had been exposed to domestic violence at home.\n\nChild Trends says parents likely under-report violence in the home out of embarrassment or fear of stigma. The research doesn't include the psychological and emotional abuse, including gaslighting, that many women and some men told USA TODAY was far worse for them and their children to live with.\n\nThe findings, children's health advocates say, underscore a need for improved detection and prevention of domestic violence, and better treatment of abuse survivors and their children in the health care system, schools and the courts.\n\nGeorgia, Huff's home, is among the states where the law recognizes the effects of domestic violence on children. The state has created criminal charges for domestic violence that happens anywhere in a house where children are present, not just when it occurs in front of the child.\n\nIn other ways, specialists say, the law and courts have a long way to go in recognizing the impact on children's well-being. Parents accused or even convicted of domestic violence in many cases are able to gain unsupervised visits with their children, or partial or full partial custody – even when children are afraid of the offender.\n\nWhen parents in an abusive relationship separate, conditions for their children can become even riskier. The nonprofit group Center for Judicial Excellence, which monitors family courts, found that more than 650 children were killed by a parent in a \"divorce, separation, custody, visitation, child support situation\" from 2008 through 2018.\n\nDomestic violence crosses racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Cheryl Branch, executive director at Savannah's SAFE women's shelter, says the calls she gets from abused women in The Landings, an exclusive gated community, are as horrific as those that come from low-income clients.\n\nShe says women are afraid to leave husbands who threaten to spend whatever it takes to gain full custody of the children. When shelter residents go back to their domestic abusers – as many do – Branch is required to notify child protection authorities, just as she would be if a parent returned to someone who has sexually abused his or her child.\n\nHuth-Bocks, the Cleveland psychologist, says researchers' ability to study human brain development has \"exploded in the last five to six years.\" So has data on the mental health and addiction effects of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs – 10 harmful experiences or conditions, including domestic violence, tracked by health professionals.\n\nGenerations of violence\n\nIn San Diego, the children of now-divorced Eric and Yadira Sanchez – Angel, Noel and their 15-year-old brother – say they can vividly recall visiting their maternal grandparents' house when they were young.\n\nThey talk about seeing their grandmother punch cabinet doors and throw drinking glasses. She and their grandfather would hit each other in front of them, they say. The grandparents could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater, Angel and Noel say, they watched as their mother chased their father with a kitchen knife and smashed a piece of a wood across his back. In December 2011, police arrested Yadira Sanchez on charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and felony spousal battery, but prosecutors declined to pursue the charges.\n\nAs the alleged violence escalated, the children's grades and mental health declined, a review of school and medical records shows. (USA TODAY is not identifying the youngest son because he is a minor.)\n\n\"When these high levels of stress happen too often and too intensely, it creates a toxic pathway that alters how our brains and bodies operate and how we think, learn and behave,\" said psychologist Sheri Madigan, a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nYadira Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, acknowledges that the boys were exposed to domestic violence. But he claims Eric Sanchez's efforts to separate the boys from their mother likely hurt them far more.\n\n\"This is not a case where physical violence was the primary factor,\" Marcus said.\n\nChange to brain, body\n\nResearchers who followed 1,420 children in North Carolina from age 9 to 30 found that exposure to domestic violence in the home had the same serious and life-changing effects as experiencing the abuse directly.\n\nThe American Medical Association published the study in November. University of Vermont psychologist William Copeland was its lead author. These children \"have the same type of poor outcomes 10, 20 years down the road\" as children who \"experience it directly themselves,\" he said.\n\nA global study out last year of more than 125,000 people from all socioeconomic backgrounds found children who witnessed domestic violence had the same risk and incidence of PTSD as soldiers returning from war.\n\nResearch presented in November at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies shows that children exposed at an early age to trauma, including domestic violence, have a smaller hippocampus – the brain area related to learning and memory formation – a risk factor for PTSD.\n\nOther research shows that the amygdala – the part of the brain that processes emotions, memory and fear – in children who have been exposed to violence reacts more strongly to threats than in children who haven't.\n\nEamon McCrory, a professor of developmental neuroscience at University College London, says the changes make it more difficult for these children to get along with others. Other studies have shown that exposing children to violence leads to lower grades and a greater probability of dropping out of school.\n\nPsychologist and professor Katie McLaughlin directs the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard. \"This change in size and likely the function of the hippocampus could be one potential mechanism that's underlying those differences in school achievement,\" she said. The brain works to help protect from danger. But when children are dealing with adversity, their brains can be overwhelmed.\n\nLearning disordered\n\nCatholic high schools around San Diego began scouting Angel Sanchez when he was in middle school, according to Phillip Lomax, his coach at the time. The strapping middle linebacker – he was 6-foot-tall and 225 pounds in high school – was hard to miss.\n\nProblem was, Sanchez said, just as his athletic abilities began gaining notice, his home life deteriorated and his grades dropped.\n\nHis mother stayed out late at night, his father found other men's numbers on her phone, and a pattern of erratic and often violent behavior against the boys and their father developed, Eric Sanchez said in requests for restraining orders and police reports.\n\nThe three boys each had an Individual Education Program detailing how they best learn given their disabilities. Angel has a speech impairment that affects his oral and written communication, reading comprehension and math problem solving. Noel was granted accommodations to receive extra time for homework and tests. The youngest boy struggles with reading and writing. All the boys were given intensive tutoring, language therapy and case managers.\n\nAs tensions between the parents rose, Angel's grade point average dropped from 3.0 at the beginning of his sixth grade to 1.3 by the start of 7th grade, school transcripts show.\n\nThat was the year – 2008 – that their mother chased their father around a table with a steak knife and stabbed the padded kitchen stools, Eric Sanchez and the boys told child welfare workers.\n\nNoel Sanchez, now 18, recalls that period. \"Oh man, I can still see and hear what happened those nights. That’s not going to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nIn children exposed to domestic violence, the parts of the brain that detect threats and anticipate pain – the anterior insula and amygdala – are strongly affected by threatening faces during brain imaging.\n\nResearchers at University College London wrote in 2011 that the results might predict a later risk factor for anxiety disorders and increasing vulnerability to mental illness. A more recent study by the same authors showed this heightened responsiveness was present even when children weren't consciously aware of a threat.\n\n\"If you've grown up in a situation that's dangerous, you're much more likely to react to something that's actually totally safe (as if it were) a potential threat,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe two younger Sanchez boys went back and forth between their feuding parents. Angel stayed with his father. School progress reports show that Noel missed 57 classes in the first three months of 2017. His younger brother missed 137.\n\nIn 2016, Yadira Sanchez was granted a restraining order against Angel. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, says Angel kept trying to take his brothers away from their mother. Yadira lost custody of the boys in March 2017.\n\nLomax, the coach, says the chaos hurt Angel's future plans. \"If you’d asked me, when he was going into 9th grade, what Angel’s potential as a linebacker was, he was certainly a Division I contender, for sure,\" he said.\n\nEric Sanchez, the father, says one high school withdrew a scholarship offer after it saw Angel's grades. He missed practice often during high school during the parents' custody fight.\n\nNoel Sanchez says that the turmoil before their parents separated, and stays with their mother after the split, were so traumatic that he attempted suicide in 2014 and considered it at other times. \"I was just trying to hurt myself to let the pain go away,\" he said.\n\nMore:Surviving Suicide Q&A: Laura answers your questions on loss, depression, the hard stuff\n\nMore:After a suicide, here’s what happens to the people left behind\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nDebbie Ricker says domestic violence looms over three generations of her family. Both the California woman and her daughter Desiree say it led to Desiree's drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental and physical health struggles.\n\nRicker fought a 15-year custody battle with her ex-husband. It ended only when her son turned 18. She says the emotional abuse she suffered and her children witnessed still affects them. \"My ex was very open with his abuse toward me,\" she said. \"The abuse occurred in front of our kids, friends, family.\"\n\nDesiree, now 29, said \"I never heard him be nice to her. He belittled her every step of the way.\"\n\nMarc Loehren, Debbie Ricker's ex-husband and Desiree's father, denies their allegations. He was never charged with a crime against them. “My two children had a wonderful childhood,\" he told USA TODAY. \"There was no violence in this household. ... if anything, the mom hit me with a car.”\n\nHe acknowledges the children have been to multiple psychologists. But he cites Ricker's family background and marriages before and after their relationship. He alleges that Ricker tried to undermine his relationship with the children.\n\n\"The children are fairly disturbed from anything that the mom has told them – which is alienation,\" Loehren said.\n\nDuring an interview for a family evaluation during the custody fight, Loehren said Ricker was scaring the children by calling the police when he allegedly violated restraining orders.\n\nBased on the evaluator's recommendation, a family court judge ordered the parents into joint counseling. The judge said each had to educate themselves on \"child development and high parental conflict.\"\n\nRicker, 62, says she asked for a divorce. She says Loehren suggested the two of them sit down and explain it to the children. She says he opened he conversation by saying \"Mommy doesn't like daddy anymore, so she is breaking our family apart.\" The kids started screaming and crying, Ricker says. Then they started to hit her.\n\nDesiree started to gain weight when she was about 5. A therapist would later attribute the weight gain to the family dysfunction. When Desiree was 12, the family doctor told Ricker that her daughter had pre-diabetes. \"It just made me cry,\" Ricker says.\n\nIn high school, Desiree says, she gained about 100 pounds – weight she still carries. At 12, Desiree says, she began an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who also came from a violent home. It lasted, on and off, until she was 27. The ex-boyfriend was never charged with abusing her.\n\nStudies show that childhood adversities can lead to obesity later in life. Duke University researchers reported last year that children aged 12 to 15 were far more likely to eat poorly and less likely to get physical activity after exposure to domestic violence.\n\n'These things go together'\n\nIt's common for children who are exposed to domestic violence to also suffer other adverse childhood experiences. ACEs are linked to a range of mental and physical health consequences throughout life, up to and including early death.\n\n“If there's domestic violence in the household, it's statistically likely that there's also physical abuse and emotional abuse and maybe drug abuse or alcohol abuse,\" said Canan Karatekin, a professor of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. \"These things go together.”\n\nHuff took on the role of protector of her younger siblings. It carried its own burden.\n\nDuring the summer before fifth grade, she says, she remembers holding one of her sisters in her lap as another was rushed to the hospital after the first of several suicide attempts. \"I had to grow up fast and be a second mom to my siblings,\" she says. \"It made me stronger. ... I was determined not to be like my sister or my mother.\"\n\nBut that was nearly impossible.\n\nHuff and her mother say domestic violence spans generations in their family.\n\nDenise Boyd was caring for a year-old daughter while she was pregnant with Huff at 21. Boyd was having a breakdown, she says, after years living with the abusive father of her children.\n\nThe father could not be reached for comment. He was never charged with a crime against Boyd.\n\nBoyd's mother went to take her home to Georgia. Once in her parents' home, Boyd says, she rarely went out. On rare occasions when she did, she would hide on the floor of the family car. \"I felt like I wasn’t the same anymore,\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nHuff was born in August 1979. As a little girl, she developed a speech disorder. In eighth grade, Huff says, she was so anxious she tried to run away. She was sent briefly to a juvenile detention facility.\n\nDavid Murphey, director of the Child Trends DataBank, describes domestic violence as a type of toxic stress linked to health problems later in life. Domestic violence rewires the brain, he said, harming executive function – \"the ability to weigh options and make well-considered choices.\"\n\nHow can communities best address abuse?\n\nDetecting, treating and preventing exposure to domestic abuse are the keys to reducing it, specialists say.\n\nCertified nurse midwife Pamela Glenn, field education supervisor at Minneapolis's Walden University School of Nursing, has screened her patients for abuse for 30 years.\n\nShe says health care professionals should create a safe space for patients, don't judge or blame, and avoid using the word \"abuse.\"\n\n“Most people, when they hear the word 'abuse,' they automatically think physical violence,\" Glenn said. \"The abuse may be emotional abuse only – but that can be extremely damaging to people's health.”\n\nShe asks questions such as “Does your partner support you?\" And \"Do you ever find that your partner is constantly checking up on you when you're not together and almost interrogating you at times?\" If she suspects abuse, she says, she offers resources such as information for an advocate or safe place.\n\nSpecialists say screening alone is not enough. \"Screening is the great first step, but it's only a first step,\" said Jess Bartlett, a trauma researcher with Child Trends. \"Too often we look at what kids have experienced, but not how they function.\" She says health care providers should look at children's needs, and whether the community has the resources to respond.\n\nMurphey agrees. “Unless there are adequate networks of services and referral practices to follow the results up,\" he said, \"what you're doing is you're really setting up an unfortunate situation where you know you've got lots of problems but you don't have services in place yet to respond to them.”\n\nWith treatment, researchers wrote in a report for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, children exposed to early trauma including domestic violence can overcome the experiences without developing stress-related disorders.\n\nOften the support of parents, friends, family and school can help alleviate the effects of stress and trauma in children, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n\n\"A strong relationship with a caring, nonviolent parent is one of the most important factors in helping children grow in a positive way despite their experiences,\" the group wrote in a 2014 report.\n\nBut Huth-Bocks said the parents she works with are often \"preoccupied keeping everyone alive and can't always be the most sensitive parent.\n\n\"There’s bigger fish to fry.\"\n\n'Pure chaos'\n\nHuff says it was a violent world that her twins entered in July 2014.\n\nShe says the father was holding the boy two days after their birth when he took a swing at her. The girl was the crib behind Huff, she says. She says she had to hold onto the crib to keep it from falling.\n\nThe father, Ignacio Ramirez Vallejo, denies her account. \"It never happened,\" he told USA TODAY. He was not charged in the alleged incident. “I’ve been in court many times,\" he said. \"Latrelle tried to accuse me for many different things. We were together almost seven years. They never find me guilty.”\n\nRamirez Vallejo says he did not sexually assault Huff.\n\nHis lawyer, A.J. Balbo, gave USA TODAY copies of letters he says Huff wrote to Ramirez Vallejo two years before the twins' birth saying she wanted to have children with him. “Everything they say about me is not true,\" Ignacio Ramirez said. \"I’m a Christian.”\n\nJeanne Fell, a nurse practitioner who specializes in neurology and has treated Huff's twins, says the pregnancy was about as complicated as they come. Huff had severe vomiting during much of the pregnancy and required intravenous medication. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks. A typical pregnancy lasts 40.\n\n\"It's been pure chaos since these kids have been born,\" Fell said. \"She does her very best, but certainly there are limits to how much she can give of herself to the children.\"\n\nBoth babies were poor eaters, Fell says. The boy had hyptonia, or floppy baby syndrome, which can be caused by nerve or brain damage. He's now on a powerful antipsychotic drug to help with aggression or and self injury, a review of his medical records show. Fell said he's \"done really well and is much more calm,\" but if he goes off the drug, she said, he hits others and tries to escape.\n\nHuff has been getting reports from her daughter's school, including one reviewed by USA TODAY from October in which she was described as \"extra tearful today\" and accused of \"mooning\" several other children.\n\nNeither child sleeps more than five hours a night, Huff says. Before he started on his current medication, Huff's son rarely slept more than three hours.\n\nHuff has a master's degree in mental health counseling and is pursuing a second master's in social work.

Susan Schneider Williams\n\nDementia is a disorder of mental processes marked by memory dysfunction, personality changes and impaired reasoning due to brain disease or injury. The exact cause of LBD, which affects about 1.4 million Americans, is unknown. But the disease is associated with the accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein, which is typically present in the brain and in small amounts in the heart, muscle and other tissues. Alpha-synuclein might help regulate neurotransmitters. But when this protein accumulates and forms masses (called Lewy bodies) within the brain, the effects are devastating.\n\nLewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease dementia are the two types of Lewy body dementias, which are the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\nBecause LBD initially presents similarly to Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, it’s often misdiagnosed. And since Lewy body proteins can’t be tested like Alzheimer’s proteins, LBD cases are often diagnosed after death when families request autopsies for closure or more details, or to donate a loved one’s brain for research.\n\nTypically for undiagnosed LBD patients who initially exhibit movement issues, doctors first diagnose them with Parkinson’s disease since it is a movement disease. If those patients later develop dementia as well, they are often diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease dementia. More specific changes in cognitive function, too, over time can lead to the diagnosis “dementia with Lewy bodies.” Although Lewy bodies are common with Parkinson’s disease, not all Parkinson’s patients will develop LBD.\n\nMisdiagnosis and overlapping symptoms can lead to a world of confusion for patients and their families, so for Schneider Williams, finally learning the truth behind her husband’s “pain and suffering” was a “pinprick of light,” she said.\n\n“That’s when my own healing started to begin,” she said. “We had this experience with something that was invisible and terrifying, truly. And then on the other side of it, I’m left to find out the science underneath it that helped explain this experience. Robin wasn’t crazy. That was one of his biggest fears.”\n\nSo that other patients and caregivers can experience the same truth, understanding and healing, Schneider Williams has been in a “rabbit hole of discovery” and advocacy for eight years now. She has served on the board of the American Brain Foundation for six years, helped establish the Lewy Body Dementia Fund and its $3 million research grant award aimed at finding an accurate biomarker, and contributed to the documentaries “Robin’s Wish” and “Spark: Robin Williams and His Battle with Lewy Body Dementia.”\n\nSchneider Williams speaks about LBD awareness and research at the 2021 BioHive Summit in Utah. Katelin Roberts\n\n“I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t tell this story,” Schneider Williams said. “I had no idea the journey I was about to begin on. But I had to go there.”\n\nDoctors and researchers wanting to mitigate the kinds of experiences her husband endured “have a tall order,” she said, “but progress is being made.”\n\n‘Chemical warfare in his brain’\n\nLewy body dementia has more than 40 symptoms that can randomly appear and disappear, Schneider Williams said. Categorically, the signs include impaired thinking, fluctuations in attention, problems with movement, visual hallucinations, sleep disorders, behavioral and mood issues, and changes in bodily functions such as the ability to control urinating.\n\nWhat “marked the beginning of a cascade of symptoms” was when her husband started experiencing never-ending fear and anxiety, Schneider Williams said. It began to happen in 2012 when Williams started to pull back from engaging with people at the Throckmorton Theatre in California, where he would try new material out and riff with other comedians just for fun, she added.\n\nThe anxieties persisted beyond what Williams had experienced in the past and what is normal for a beloved actor living with the pressures of being on a world stage.\n\nEventually, paranoia was another significant symptom, Schneider Williams said. “It was the amygdala region of his brain that had a ginormous amount of the Lewy bodies. So that area of the brain is really our ability to regulate our emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. And Robin’s was basically broken.”\n\nToward the end, Williams also experienced delusional looping. “Your brain is concocting a story of what you think reality is,” Schneider Williams said. “And the people around you are unable to rationalize with you and bring you back into what is actually real. So it’s incredibly scary for everyone around someone who’s deluded as well as the deluded person.\n\n“As a caregiver, you feel incredibly powerless when you realize, ‘Oh my gosh, nothing I say or do anymore can bring him back to what’s real.’ And that’s a very scary place,” she said. “Lewy body – it really takes over.”\n\nWilliams was stressed by work, his sudden forgetfulness and changing personality, and insufficient sleep – which progressed to severe insomnia that removed the separation between day and night in the couple’s home. “Our house was like ‘Night at the Museum’ at night,” Schneider Williams said. Pulling him back from nighttime delusions would take hours, sometimes days, she added. “Imagined fear on fire – that is what it is.”\n\nHallucinations are “a key hallmark of LBD that can really help in identifying the disease,” Schneider Williams said, but also a tough symptom many LBD patients don’t want to discuss. She didn’t know about her husband’s hallucinations until her conversation with a medical professional who had reviewed his medical records. A delusion involves a storyline with people who can deconstruct it for you – but a hallucination is something only you see and therefore is easier to hide.\n\n“Lewy body is neurological; it’s a circuitry problem. So the chemical and structural changes happening in Robin’s brain were responsible for the psychiatric symptoms that he was experiencing,” Schneider Williams said at Life Itself. Those included depression.\n\nThe doctors Schneider Williams met with after learning of his diagnosis “indicated his was one of the worst pathologies they had seen. He had about 40% loss of dopamine neurons,” she wrote in her 2016 article “The terrorist inside my husband’s brain” for the journal Neurology. “The massive proliferation of Lewy bodies throughout his brain had done so much damage to neurons and neurotransmitters that in effect, you could say he had chemical warfare in his brain.”\n\nAntipsychotic medications were dangerous for him and made some symptoms worse, as they do for some LBD patients, Schneider Williams said.\n\nIf people experiencing neurodegeneration can still do some routines such as work or walk their dog, those “usual, well-worn pathways can provide comfort,” Schneider Williams said. When people can no longer do those things, symptoms can worsen and lead to devastating feelings of isolation.\n\n‘Every yard gained matters’\n\nNearly eight years after the diagnosis that catalyzed Schneider Williams’ research journey, she is “just now starting to really pick up the pieces of my own life,” she said.\n\n“I kind of need to go underground for a while and relocate my inspiration and my true passion, which is art and painting,” Schneider Williams said. She plans for a portion of all her future print sales to go to LBD research, and she will stay in touch with efforts related to the documentaries and the Lewy Body Dementia Fund, where she remains lead chair.\n\nSchneider Williams paints at her home in Marin, California, in 2019. Richard Corman\n\nAs Schneider Williams widens her focus while leaving her door open for LBD advocacy, experts continue their research efforts.\n\n“We’re always learning more and more about the disease, from the basic science studies looking at cells and test tubes, to animal models, to human observational studies,” said Dr. James Galvin, a professor of neurology and director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nRecent highlights include the introduction of at least two new diagnostics, Galvin said: a spinal fluid test from the company Amprion and a skin biopsy test from CND Life Sciences. The spinal fluid test tracks misfolded synuclein and helps doctors diagnose brain diseases, including LBD. The skin biopsy test aims to help doctors distinguish between serious neurologic disorders.\n\n“To have diagnostics – that can confirm in life that someone has Lewy body disease – goes a long way both toward confirming the diagnosis and advancing research,” Galvin said. “The earlier you can start people on treatments, the easier to enroll people in clinical trials to test new medications.”\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has awarded Galvin and the company Cognition Therapeutics a $29 million grant for studying whether a new drug, CT1812, is safe and effective for patients with LBD.\n\nTo treat LBD, doctors “borrow medicines from Alzheimer’s to treat cognitive symptoms, from Parkinson’s to treat motor symptoms, from narcolepsy to treat attention deficits and from psychiatry to treat behavioral symptoms,” Galvin said in a news release. CT1812 could help the brains of LBD patients clear toxic proteins and protect against functional loss.\n\n“When I wrote that editorial ‘The terrorist inside my husband’s brain,’ I was convinced that a diagnosis wouldn’t matter anyway, because there is no cure,” Schneider Williams said at Life Itself. “But my thinking since then has completely changed. Diagnosis is everything – not just for the patients and caregivers, but for the doctors, clinicians and researchers. If we had an accurate diagnosis, we could have sought specialized care.”\n\nThe Lewy Body Dementia Association has formed a Research Centers of Excellence Program, with 22 sites across the United States, to collaborate on clinical trials, assess needs for resources and infrastructure, and develop better measures of clinical symptoms, said Angela Taylor, the association’s interim executive director.\n\n“We can’t undo changes that have already occurred,” said Dr. Samantha Holden, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Colorado and director of the Memory Disorders Clinic at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. “But if we catch people early enough, can we prevent it from progressing?”\n\nResearch progress is being made in baby steps. When asked whether there has ever been a point when she felt like giving up, Schneider Williams said, “Oh, my God. Pick a day.”\n\n“It’s very overwhelming when you look at all the millions and bazillions of dollars that are spent on research and you think, ‘Oh my God, have we really progressed at all?’ ” she added. But with how complex LBD is, “every yard gained matters.”\n\n“Whoever has hope has many days of feeling the darkness,” Schneider Williams said. “But the thing about hope is that no matter what, you dust yourself off, you pick yourself up and you go forward. And you don’t do that alone.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/02/26/brain-death-you-may-get-last-memory-flashback-before-you-die/6909660001/", "title": "The brain at death: You may get 'last memory flashback' before you die", "text": "What happens when we die? As the moment of death approaches, memories of your life may really flash before you, new research suggests.\n\nThis idea of a quick binge of past memories just before dying is not new, as experiences such as these – and other phenomena including out-of-body experiences – have been documented among those who've survived near-death experiences.\n\nResearchers have now reported what they say may be the first evidence of such memory recalls in a human brain near death, in the peer-reviewed Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.\n\nThe patient treated was an 87-year-old man who came to the Vancouver General Hospital emergency room in 2016 after a fall. Three days after surgery to relieve a buildup of blood between the skull and the brain, the patient began having seizures and the medical team started an electroencephalogram (EEG) test to monitor his brain activity and treat the seizures.\n\n'The Rally':Hospice nurse's videos on unexplained death phenomena goes viral on TikTok\n\nNew CDC guidance:Mask guidelines would allow most Americans to unmask indoors,\n\nDuring this recording, the patient suffered a heart attack. The researchers recorded 900 seconds of brain activity before and around the patient's death – the first-ever recording of a dying human's brain, said Dr. Ajmal Zemmar, who treated the patient in Vancouver General Hospital in 2016 and is now a neurosurgeon at the University of Louisville neurosurgeon, where he pursued the study.\n\nIn-depth analysis of the patient's EEG around the 30 seconds before and after the patient's heart stopped beating identified brain waves that normally happen in healthy human brains when we undergo memory recall, out-of-body experiences, meditation and similar experiences. These brain waves, also called oscillations, happening around the time of death suggest a potential \"last 'recall of life' that may take place in the near-death state,\" researchers wrote.\n\nThe pattern of these waves could be the neurophysiological basis of near-death experiences, Zemmar told USA TODAY.\n\nThe researchers expressed caveats, including injury, seizures, swelling and anesthesia that could make the interpretation of the data difficult. But there are similarities to the oscillations in healthy humans undergoing out-of-body experiences and evidence from rats where these brain waves were also seen after cardiac arrest in a 2013 study, researchers said.\n\n\"We are seeing for the first time that these same brain waves that in a healthy human are known to be responsible for dreaming, meditation and out-of-body experiences are now observed in the dying human brain,\" Zemmar said.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nDo we get a 'last memory flashback'?\n\nIn the past six years, Zemmar and the research team have sought to find another example of an EEG recorded at the time of death because scientific data from one case is very thin ice to draw conclusions from, he said. But unfortunately no other case was found forcing the team to publish the single existing dataset from a dying human brain.\n\n“Something we may learn from this research is: although our loved ones have their eyes closed and are ready to leave us to rest, their brains may be replaying some of the nicest moments they experienced in their lives,” Zemmar said.\n\nCaregivers could take some solace in the findings, he said. Medical personnel often must tell family members that a loved one \"is unfortunately not going to make it. These situations, no matter how long you do the job, they never get easier,\" Zemmar said.\n\n\"One thing I'm hoping that this could do is that I could tell them, 'Your loved one is okay. They're not suffering. They're not having pain in the last moments of life. They're replaying memories that they had with you throughout life'\" he said. \"I think that would be something comforting in that … extremely difficult situation to lose somebody.\"\n\nFor the rest of us, perhaps we will rest easier knowing there's the potential for what the researchers termed a \"last memory flashback\" before we die.\n\nWhen asked about spiritual advice on death, Zemmar said, \"As scientists, we focus on interpreting data to understand nature and we share our conclusions with society. From here on in, everyone should decide for themselves how they like to imagine the spiritual side around death.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/14/the-excerpt-podcast-house-joe-biden-impeachment-investigation/71917354007/", "title": "The Excerpt podcast: House authorizes Biden impeachment ...", "text": "On today's episode of The Excerpt podcast: House Republicans have authorized an impeachment investigation into President Joe Biden.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, December 14th, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, House Republicans have authorized an impeachment inquiry into the president, plus we'll look at two cases the Supreme Court will take on, and how fathers who spend more time with their infants see changes to their brain.\n\n♦\n\nHouse Republicans yesterday formally authorized their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. It's their most significant step yet toward impeaching the president. The House voted along party lines 221 to 212 to green light the inquiry. Republicans have alleged that the president financially benefited from his family's foreign business dealings, though they have not publicly released evidence supporting those claims. House Republicans have also accused the White House of disrupting their investigation. Though the White House says it has cooperated fully with the investigation and provided plenty of evidence disputing allegations. Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, said that the impeachment inquiry \"only proves how divorce from reality this cham investigation is.\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP investigators leading the inquiries say it's simply an investigation and that they have not predetermined whether to draft articles of impeachment against Biden. Johnson said this week, \"We're not making a political decision. It's not, it's a legal decision.\"\n\n♦\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed yesterday to take on a pair of cases, one dealing with the abortion pill, Mifepristone, and another related to January 6th. I caught up with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze for more. Hey there, John.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nHey, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJohn, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments about the abortion drug, Mifepristone. Can you just first remind us, John, what this drug is and what it functionally does?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nYeah, I mean, we've been describing it as an abortion pill. It's a pill that's usually taken in conjunction with another drug that induces an abortion. This is a pill that took on a lot of significance after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, because a lot of states are making it harder for people to get abortions, and so a lot of people are turning to medication abortion instead of in-clinic procedures. Roughly half of the abortions in this country are handled through drugs.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou mentioned overturning Roe v Wade. What else legally led to this moment, John, and what will justices actually be deciding here?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nSo this is a debate that's been going on in the courts now for months and months and months. It's been up and down and all over the place. It's actually been to the Supreme Court before on the emergency docket. At that time, back in April, the Supreme Court froze everything, put everything on hold. What we're really talking about here is restrictions to the drug. This drug was approved during the Clinton administration. So the drug's been around for a long time.\n\nOver the course of the last many years the FDA has made it easier to gain access to the drug, such as by allowing non-physicians to prescribe it. So think like nurse practitioners. The other thing that they did that I think most people are paying attention to is they allowed people to get it through the mail. So instead of having to go pick it up in a doctor's office, they allowed people to get it delivered to them. That was, of course, done during the COVID-19 pandemic. So that was the ostensible reason for it. But the Biden administration has continued and expanded that provision to make clear that people who want to get this drug don't have to go to the doctor's office to get it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJohn, while the court works toward a decision here, will people have access to the drug in the coming months or is everything just kind of on pause?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nYes, they will. In fact, they'll continue to have the same access that they had before because of a Supreme Court ruling back in April that said that everything would maintain where it was before this litigation started and nothing would change until the Supreme Court resolved the issue.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate case, John, justices have agreed to take on an appeal from a man involved in the January 6th attack. What's at issue here?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThe federal prosecutors charging the folks that were involved in January 6th have been repeatedly charging this one crime, and it's a federal crime, and it deals with obstructing a \"official\" proceeding. That's not entirely clear what official proceeding means. And the defendants, including this gentleman who is bringing this case to the Supreme Court says, look, this was a provision that was passed during the Enron scandal many years back. It really deals with financial impropriety. It really deals with the destruction of evidence and trying to stop people like corporate executives from destroying evidence. Prosecutors say, I mean, official proceeding is official proceeding and the counting of the votes, the electors by Congress on January 6th, the government argues should count as an official proceeding.\n\nThe reason why this is important is that whatever the Supreme Court decides here, it's going to affect two things. One is roughly 200 other people that have been charged with this crime and one of those 200 people, the second thing, is former President Donald Trump has been charged with this crime. So depending on what the Supreme Court does here, it could implicate the charges against Trump. I should say one last thing. The reason prosecutors are really eager to charge this crime is that it carries a potential 20 additional years in prison. So it's no joke, it's a serious crime and for prosecutors trying to maximize sentences, that is why they are relying on this provision for so many of these cases.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. USA Today Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze. Thanks as always, John.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThank you, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAn appeals court ruled yesterday that former President Donald Trump cannot point to his time in the White House in an effort to duck a civil defamation lawsuit tied to sexual assault allegations. The case concerns Trump's denial in 2019 while he was president of having sexually assaulted writer E. Jean Caroll in the 1990s, he called her account a false accusation. In a separate civil case, Trump was ordered in May to pay Caroll $5 million after a jury found both that he sexually abused her and defamed her with a statement last year denying the assault. Trump has appealed that verdict.\n\n♦\n\nThe Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged yesterday. The Fed also hinted that rate hikes are likely over for now, and forecast three cuts next year amid falling inflation and a cooling economy. The decision leaves the Fed's benchmark short-term rate at a 22-year high of five and a quarter to five and a half percent after a slew of rate increases aimed at subduing the country's sharpest inflation spike in four decades. The Central Bank has now kept its key rates steady for three straight meetings since July. That brings more relief for consumers who have faced higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable rate mortgages, and other loans as a result of the Fed's moves. After the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at our record high yesterday, up 1.4% from the previous day. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ saw similar climbs.\n\n♦\n\nResearch finds that fathers who spend more time with their infants experience brain changes, but not every dad can take paternity leave. I spoke with USA Today health reporter Adrianna Rodriguez, to learn more. Adrianna, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt.\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what does research say about what happens to father's brains when they spend large amounts of time with their infants?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nBasically what happens when a father spends a large amount of time with their newborns, they undergo these changes to brain patterns that we typically see in mothers right after birth, except obviously the father has not gone through this sort of flush of hormones and the experience of pregnancy. Yet we see this more subtle, but still very visible brain change. In the first study that we had looked at, the most recent study, researchers had found that these brain changes were more pronounced in the men who had spent more time with their children.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd how does some of these brain changes actually influence paternal behavior?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nBasically what happened in this one mice experiment, researchers had looked into the brains of both female and male mice and looked at the connectivity and certain cells that were being stimulated when they were performing parental behaviors. In the mice world, the parental behavior was looking for their pup and retrieving it. And they saw that these same cells were being stimulated in both the male and the female mice that were performing these behaviors sort of suggesting that they're going through the same patterns in the brain.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAdrianna, anecdotally, what does some dads say about their experiences with paternity leave and this time with their newborns and what it's done for them?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nThat was the best part of the story, talking to these new dads. They absolutely loved their experience in paternity leave. They loved being able to just focus on their child 100%. They loved not having to think about work and just think about their bond and their relationship. When I told them that this is a story about how your brain changes, they told me, \"I could see that, because I don't know if I would've been able to understand my infant's different cry cues, whether she or he needed to be fed or needed to be burped or needed to be changed if I didn't spend this sort of time with them bonding and understanding what they're trying to communicate.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAdrianna, not every dad can do this. I mean, there are structures that exist in this country that in some cases prevent it. What does US law say right now about paternity leave across the country?\n\nAdrianna Rodriguez:\n\nYeah, so unfortunately US is one of the only high-income countries that doesn't guarantee paid family leave. They have FMLA, which sort of guarantees unpaid parental leave for parents of newborns and newly adopted children of up to 12 weeks. But that's also still fluid because it only guarantees unpaid weeks and not every parent can afford that. And on top of that, it only applies to companies that have at least 50 employees or more. Even though we have that throughout the country, federally, a lot of parents still don't have access to paid paternity leave.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right.

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nBeing pregnant is tough enough, but with the added pressure of work, a shaky economy and the risks of Covid-19, it can seem overwhelming. But if it’s possible, expectant mothers should try to take stock of their stress and reach out for help to reduce how often their newborn is likely to experience negative emotions, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published Wednesday in the journal Infancy, found babies of moms who experienced more fluctuations in stress during pregnancy showed more fear, sadness and distress at 3 months than those of moms who were less stressed.\n\nWomen with higher fluctuations were more likely to report that their babies often seemed angry, crying or fussing when left in a crib; showed distress when they were tired; and clung to a parent when introduced to an unfamiliar adult, the study said.\n\n“We know that infants experiencing chronic stimulation of the stress response system (chronically elevated cortisol), or ‘toxic stress,’ without the buffer of a caring adult have impact on early brain development, immune system and epigenetics,” said Dr. Marian Earls, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Healthy Mental & Emotional Development, in an email. She was not involved in the study.\n\nResearch on infants of mothers with postpartum depression sheds light on other potential impacts as well. For example, children of depressed mothers are more likely to have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol as preschoolers, “and these changes in levels are linked with anxiety, social wariness, and withdrawal,” according to the AAP’s policy statement on depression after birth.\n\nThese children may have “poor self-control, poor peer relationships, school problems, and aggression,” as well as attachment disorders, behavior problems, and depression and other mood disorders, the statement said.\n\nHowever, a 2019 study found that if a child has a caring adult that can provide a safe and stable nurturing relationship, many childhood adversities can be modified.\n\nGathering stress data in real time\n\nResearchers had 72 women complete surveys about their stress levels up to four times a day over a 14-week period during pregnancy. When their babies turned 3 months old, mothers filled out the Infant Behavior Questionnaire, a survey that measures infant temperament.\n\nMeasuring the highs and lows of stress in real time during pregnancy allowed scientists to see a more comprehensive picture of the women’s levels of tension.\n\nHigh fluctuations could mean that “individuals have more instability in their current life circumstances, or that those individuals might have a tendency to perceive their circumstances to be less stable or they have more difficulty regulating their emotions,” said lead study author Leigha MacNeill, research assistant professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nThese frequent changes may have important implications for children’s emotional development, MacNeill said.\n\nThe next step in the study team’s research is to look at how a mother’s biology changes as her stress fluctuates, so researchers can learn more about how it affects the baby, she said.\n\nAdditionally, it’s normal to experience some stress during pregnancy, so more data is needed to determine what types and levels of stress impact the mother and her baby, MacNeil said.\n\nThe pandemic did not affect stress patterns\n\nWhile the researchers did not intend to conduct this study during a pandemic, it was a happy accident because it allowed them to examine if stress levels were different in pregnant women before and during Covid-19.\n\n“We found that participants reported similar levels of stress patterns regardless of whether their stress measurements were taken before or during the pandemic,” MacNeill said.\n\nThe study is limited, however, because most of the women were middle-to-upper class, partnered and well educated, which could have shielded them from much of the stress families felt during the pandemic, the authors say.\n\nHow you can reduce stress before and after pregnancy\n\nIt’s natural to feel stressed during pregnancy, but there are strategies to keep it from negatively affecting women and their babies.\n\nExpectant moms can try deep breathing exercises to reduce stress and lower their heart rate. One technique is called abdominal breathing, which is where you inhale through your nose for five seconds, then exhale through your nose for another five seconds.\n\nExercising for at least 150 minutes per week may lessen the risk of developing depression and reduce anxiety and stress during pregnancy, according to a 2019 report published in the journal Medicina.\n\nAn activity like yoga can strengthen the muscles used during childbirth and lessen the severity of medical conditions like nausea and back pain, according to the Mayo Clinic. Yoga is also a calming form of physical activity, which can improve your mental health by releasing endorphins, or feel-good hormones.\n\nWomen should speak with their gynecologist to ensure physical activity is safe during pregnancy, Mayo Clinic said.\n\nEngaging in stress-reducing activities postpartum can also be beneficial for both moms and their babies. Research has shown that allowing new mothers more opportunities to “bond with, breastfeed, and simply stroke their children,” can help babies reduce “their stress responses more effectively,” the AAP noted in a policy statement on preventing toxic stress in childhood.\n\nPositive, as well as negative, life events can mold a child’s future, the AAP stated, adding that studies have shown that positive experiences like book reading with “engaged, responsive caregivers,” age-appropriate play with other children, and quality day care and preschool education “are associated with positive impacts on learning, behavior, and health.”", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/20/north-carolina-wilderness-therapy-death-12-year-old-boy/72669232007/", "title": "North Carolina wilderness therapy death and the trauma for survivors", "text": "North Carolina health officials said Friday that they are removing all children from the care of a wilderness therapy program, Trails Carolina, nearly two weeks after the death of a 12-year-old New York boy.\n\nThe boy was transported by two men from New York to Trails Carolina on Feb. 2. The next morning, emergency workers responded to a 911 call reporting that the boy was not breathing. His cause of death is still pending.\n\nIn an affidavit filed with a search warrant, Detective Andrew Patterson stated that when investigators arrived on Feb. 3, the boy was cold to the touch and his body was in rigor mortis. A CPR mask covered the boy’s face and detectives noted possible bruising around his eye, Patterson stated.\n\nIn 2022, USA TODAY published this detailed investigation into the long-term impact of wilderness therapy programs, including a look at Trails Carolina specifically.\n\nIn brochures and online, these programs can look idyllic, touting an opportunity for children struggling with a myriad of behavioral issues to \"connect with nature\" and \"find hope and healing.\"\n\nBut former campers who spoke with USA TODAY paint a different picture. They tell of being abused by staff, of fearing punishment at all hours. They describe living in filth.\n\nThey call themselves survivors.\n\nOne former staffer we spoke to at Trails Carolina detailed why he thought his training as well as the treatment teens received at the program was entirely insufficient.\n\nHere’s the whole story:\n\nThe bathroom consisted of a tarp tied between two trees.\n\nWhen Katelyn Haruko Schmisseur used it, she made eye contact with a staff member. She squatted, they stared. A requirement of her wilderness therapy program, they told her.\n\nBecause of her eating disorder, a staff member was with her at all times almost the entire length of her stay in the Utah desert.\n\nA bucket lined with a biohazard bag acted as a receptacle for solid waste. As the weather got warmer, the smell got stronger. The flies were incessant.\n\nWith only one roll of toilet paper a week to be split among 10 people, Katelyn would resort to cleaning herself with sticks and leaves.\n\n\"It was just so nasty,\" she says. \"They didn't care. ... (It was) just another form of dehumanizing you and taking away your dignity.\"\n\nShe was 16 when she first arrived with only a few items, all stuffed into a 40-pound backpack.\n\nThe first activity? A grueling 3-mile hike.\n\n\"I was terrified,\" says Katelyn, now in her 20s.\"I missed my family more than anything. I just remember feeling so helpless. It's like you're living in this existence, but you don't have free will, you don't have autonomy, and they make that very clear to you. They make it very clear to you that you are a patient. You have no freedom. You have no choice.\"\n\nKatelyn is one of many former campers coming forward to share their experiences with wilderness therapy, a type of treatment parents often turn to when they feel they need professional help for their kids and counseling isn't enough.\n\nIn recent years, the \"troubled teen industry,\" which includes reform schools and residential treatment facilities, has come under scrutiny as former students speak out about the alleged mistreatment they experienced. (One big name who has elevated the cause is Paris Hilton.) But as the industry overall inches toward reform, wilderness therapy tends to fly under the radar.\n\nThat's because it's often billed as a shorter-term solution to problems (the typical wilderness program runs about 90 days), and there's also a lack of federal oversight into these private programs, experts say. In brochures and online, these programs look idyllic, touting an opportunity for children struggling with a myriad of behavioral issues to \"connect with nature\" and \"find hope and healing.\"\n\nBut former campers who spoke with USA TODAY paint a different picture. They tell of being abused by staff, of fearing punishment at all hours. They describe living in filth.\n\nThey call themselves survivors.\n\nAnd, perhaps most telling, they say wilderness therapy served as the gateway to separate, longer-term residential treatment centers. Of the dozen former campers USA TODAY spoke to, nine were sent for further treatment. None say wilderness therapy helped them with their struggles. All described their experience as negative and traumatizing.\n\nDespite accusations of abuse and experts in the field denouncing this type of treatment, some remain staunch proponents of wilderness therapy, saying it worked for their families. And even with past lawsuits and viral horror stories, wilderness therapy is still a booming industry in the U.S. today.\n\nDespite allegations, deaths wilderness therapy lives on\n\nWilderness therapy has existed in some form for more than half a century, gaining steam in the ‘90s with programs promising the healing power of nature could cure any problems parents faced with their kids. The pandemic gave it an extra bump.\n\n\"Business was booming for them (during COVID-19),\" says Jonathan Hyde, a former staffer who took a job at North Carolina-based wilderness program Trails Carolina in 2020. \"People were at their wits' end at home, and their kids (were) acting up, so they (sent them) off.\"\n\nIn the United States, there are about 40 wilderness therapy programs – part of 2,000 overall \"troubled teen\" programs, with anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 children now enrolled, says Bobby Cook, executive director and chief operational officer of Breaking Code Silence, a nonprofit that advocates against the troubled teen industry. The approaches of these programs vary, as do the reasons that parents send their teens to them.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to wilderness therapy programs and their proponents, who defended their practices as enriching and beneficial to participants. Trails Carolina, for example, says it fully trains its staff, involves parents in the process and develops individual treatment plans for each student. Many claim those who completed the therapy fully recovered from disorders such as depression and anxiety.\n\nBut critics point to the number of allegations and deaths at wilderness therapy camps as a clear sign that parents, legislators and the media need to be looking more closely at these institutions.\n\nAmong the fatalities: In 1990, 16-year-old Kristen Chase died of heatstroke three days after arriving at her wilderness program. In 2000, 15-year-old William Edward Lee died from a head injury after being restrained by staff; 14-year-old Ian August died of hyperthermia at his wilderness therapy program two years later. The same year, Charles Moody, 17, died of asphyxiation after being restrained. In 2005, Anthony Haynes, 14, died while being punished at a wilderness boot camp. In 2007, Caleb Jensen, 15, died while at a wilderness camp, his body found bundled in a feces- and urine-soaked sleeping bag. In 2011, Daniel Huerta, 17, died while being driven by a staff member. In 2016, 19-year-old Lane Lesko died during an escape attempt at a hybrid wilderness-residential treatment center.\n\n‘I was so desperate’\n\nMost parents don't send their kids off to wilderness therapy at the first sign of a problem. Rather, kids wind up there after their parents feel they've exhausted all other options.\n\nKatelyn's mother, Tessie Schmisseur, learned about wilderness therapy through a friend-recommended educational consultant, whom she describes as a \"very demanding, pushy ... high-pressure salesperson.\"\n\n\"I was just an anxious mom. I loved (Katelyn) to death,\" she says. \"I was so desperate and desperately wanting to save my child from herself.\"\n\nKatelyn had begun drinking and sneaking out, and that coupled with her bulimia had her parents panicked. They'd tried every punishment they could think of, including removing her door and boarding up her windows.\n\nThe final option? A wilderness therapy program called Evoke Entrada that the consultant highly recommended.\n\nTessie was resistant. The consultant often rubbed her the wrong way, but she convinced the Schmisseurs the program was for the best. And in three days, Katelyn was shipped off to Utah, clueless about where she was going.\n\n\"We had to pretend that everything was OK,\" Tessie says, choking up. \"The education consultant all along was like, 'It's fine, I've worked with (the program before). You need to listen to me' ... And so we did. We did what we were told because we wanted the best for her. And in hindsight, it was the very wrong decision.\"\n\nHyde, the former staffer from a different program, says he remembers a 16-year-old girl who was at the top of her class and even held a manager position at her job. \"The mom had died and the dad sent her away, because he found out that she (had become sexually active),\" he recalls.\n\n\"The kid got sent away as this form of punishment. ... That's not therapeutic, right? You can't help people out while you're punishing them.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evoke said the program's goal is to help both children and parents.\"My experience is that the mass majority of everybody is having wonderful experiences,\" the spokesperson said, \"but those who have wonderful experiences and speak out about it get bullied and shut down.”\n\n‘I could barely move’\n\nKyra Frankowski says she saw no shortage of punishments during her stay at Second Nature Wilderness, where she was sent when she was 14.\n\nWith a plastic tarp for shelter, Kyra and her fellow campers battled freezing temperatures in Utah in January 2014, layering their few items of clothing to keep warm.\n\nBecause there was often snow, the ground stayed wet. It once took them six hours to make a fire.\n\nThis was one of several \"consequences,\" or punishments, campers experienced if someone disobeyed a rule, she says. Unnecessary physical exertion was another, such as pack drills, where they were given under a minute to unpack and repack their bags. And it had to be done correctly, with the proper organization, or it would be repeated until it could be done within the time limit.\n\nOne night, her shoes were taken from her and she was forcibly wrapped in her tarp, she says. A staff member held down one side to prevent her from escaping, leaving an opening near her head to allow her to breathe. She says she stayed like that all night, unable to move.\n\nAs a sexual assault survivor, Kyra was particularly distressed that a male staffer was sleeping next to her, holding her in place. \"They'd wrap it so tight I could barely move my hands.\"\n\nSecond Nature did not respond to USA TODAY's multiple requests for comment about Kyra's allegations.\n\nEvery other week, Kyra and her peers would take makeshift sponge baths, dipping a bandana into a bucket of water and dabbing it with a bit of soap.\n\n\"At the end you would just rinse yourself off with whatever water was left over. It was very difficult to get properly cleaned.\"\n\nDuring the coldest months, she says, campers would forgo these baths altogether in favor of staying warm.\n\n\"We were very dirty.\"\n\n‘I would not wish this on anybody’\n\nTessie cried every day while her daughter was away, but Katelyn never knew.\n\n\"They would tell us ... 'You may not tell her that you love her. You may not tell her that you miss her; you may not give her any hope of coming home.\" And, Tessie says, the staff would dismiss and discredit anything negative about the program that was conveyed in Katelyn's letters, telling her family: \"She is going to say whatever (it takes) because, of course, she wants to come home.\"\n\nBut the conditions, as they learned later, \"were horrible.\"\n\n\"We weren't aware of all this,\" Tessie says through tears. \"I would not wish this on anybody, knowing what I know now. I always tell her she's the most courageous person I know.\"\n\nKatelyn feared retaliation if she spoke freely about what she was witnessing.\n\n\"You couldn't complain. It really broke me down to the smallest I've ever been in my life. It was terrifying. ... I remember just feeling like I had no voice. I had nothing.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evoke said students' letters are not monitored, but parents may send letters to the therapist for feedback.\n\nEvoke is committed to the \"emotional and physical safety\" of participants, the spokesperson said, adding the program encourages anyone with complaints of abuse or mistreatment to report their concerns. \"We support healing and growth and that can only happen in the context of emotional safety.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added, \"Anybody who experiences abuse from any program should have their voice heard. Any program that practices punitive, shameful, controlling, coercive, intimidating behavior should be reprimanded, if not shut down.\"\n\n‘I didn’t feel prepared’\n\nA nature enthusiast, Hyde, 35, had years of experience with recreational outdoor activities. So when the pandemic left him unemployed, he got a job as a \"wilderness field instructor\" at Trails Carolina.\n\nHe was familiar with the reputation of the wilderness therapy industry. In 2014, 17-year-old Alec Lansing died while running away from the same program. But Hyde assumed the claims of mistreatment he had heard whispers about had improved.\n\nHe says now that notion was wrong.\n\nAccording to its website, the program's groups are led by \"experienced, licensed therapists who specialize in working with youth who fit their group’s profile.\"\n\n\"There was a couple of weeks there where the licensed therapist wouldn't even show up to that group, and it was her assistant who didn't even have credentials,\" he says. \"If you're paying that much money, I would think you'd be getting therapy multiple times a week.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, Trails Carolina said primary therapists are on site \"two to three days per week\" to oversee each participant's individualized treatment plan and monitor progress.\n\n\"Therapeutic progress occurs seven days a week in the field through the assignments, activities and challenges outlined in each student’s treatment plan to help them grow emotionally and develop transferable skills that can be used outside the program in real life,\" Trails Carolina said in an emailed statement.\n\nWhile students also participated in activities like art or yoga once a week, Hyde doesn't believe most campers got the professional help they needed.\n\n\"Whenever the therapist did come in, it was pretty rare that they actually would talk to us – the people that had been with the kids for this lengthy amount of time – just to see how the week had (gone).\"\n\nThe remainder of the 24/7 schedule was spent with field instructors like himself, who he felt were ill-equipped to handle the level of care some of the campers needed.\n\n\"Some of these kids are trying to kill themselves. I didn't feel really prepared for exactly what I was getting into.\"\n\nThat was in part, he says, because what was supposed to be a five-day training was cut in half and mostly focused on what type of gear they were allowed to bring, what tools and restraints they would have at their disposal. Hyde says he was let go when he pushed back on some of the program's practices.\n\nTrails Carolina says its staff partakes in a long list of training, including sessions in first aid, nutrition, suicide prevention and crisis de-escalation. The program denied Hyde's version of events and said he was dismissed for violating the program's policies and philosophies.\n\nCook, of the nonprofit Breaking Code Silence, says there's often a disconnect between what programs promise and what they deliver in almost every area, from credentials to care.\n\n\"A lot of programs, not all of them but a lot, have had experiences where the staff of the schools are not certified to be doing what they're doing,\" Cook says. \"There are therapists who weren't necessarily qualified in that area to be working in that realm.\"\n\nAs a mom, Tessie trusted the nearly $60,000, three-month Evoke Entrada program would have top-notch staffing.\n\n\"They're going to take care of her, the counselors are there, don't worry about it,\" she remembers telling herself. \"But it really appeared that they were young adults watching over them that weren't really equipped or specialized. Just older kids watching over younger kids.\"\n\nThe program wielded more power over Tessie and her family than she expected.\n\n\"They just made it seem like (she was) such a rotten kid and that she couldn't come home after the wilderness program,\" she says, instead suggesting Katelyn go to an aftercare program.\n\nIn her heart, Tessie felt it was time for Katelyn to come home, but the smiling photos she received of Katelyn at camp helped convince her that everything was fine.\n\nPlus, after spending so much money on the program, she wanted to believe in it. Tessie's parents loaned her $20,000 to cover the cost of Katelyn's aftercare after the wilderness program had put a strain on them financially.\n\n\"It's just misleading to parents,\" she says.\n\n‘Just trying to survive’\n\nDuring the intake process, staff stripped Katelyn of all her clothes, jewelry and electronics.\n\nIn return, she was given three pairs of underwear, one T-shirt, a pair of cargo pants, socks, shoes and a sleeping bag – nothing that would help her keep track of time.\n\nShe understood this to be an intentional strategy to \"strip us of our autonomy.\"\n\nKyra's program also kept her in the dark about timelines and release dates.\n\n\"They don't tell you even around when you might be leaving because that's 'future tripping.' 'You're getting lost in future thought,'\" she recalls being told. Instead, she was told to stay focused on the present, which was \"very difficult\" given the circumstances.\n\n\"I felt like I was stripped down to my most vulnerable point,\" she says. \"That's what they would say was the point. They were trying to 'break us down so they could build us back up.'\"\n\nThe breaking down she felt – but not the building up.\n\n\"We were just at our most raw, vulnerable state, just trying to survive.\"\n\nHyde remembers a student who \"basically snapped\" after finding out, instead of getting out and going back home, his family was sending him to a therapeutic boarding school.\n\n\"He fought so hard that he went unconscious and was limp in my arms,\" Hyde recalls. \"The thought that I had a dead child in my arms – that was terrifying.\"Hyde says the teen eventually recovered. ​​​​​Trails Carolina said the program has no record of a participant falling unconscious in the field.\n\nWhy critics say wilderness therapy fails\n\nIt's true, nature can be healing. And a nontraditional therapy route can be beneficial for some people. There are people who say wilderness therapy saved their lives, and some parents insist it stopped their children from going down a destructive path.\n\nMichael Gass, a professor in the Outdoor Education Program at the University of New Hampshire and director of the Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Center, say his years of research led to positive findings, showing wilderness therapy to be safe and effective.\n\nBut critics have lambasted his findings as it has ties to the leaders of some of these institutions. (In 2018, Gass co-wrote a study with Steven DeMille, the executive director of a Utah-based wilderness program at the time.) Gass also acknowledged no randomized controlled trials have proved the efficacy of wilderness therapy.\n\nOthers argue even if wilderness therapy is effectual for some, its premise is flawed.\n\n\"If a child is yanked out of his or her home, taken to somewhere that they are highly resistant to – we're now adding the element of additional trauma,\" says Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of \"Joy from Fear.\"\n\nWhen it comes to trauma-informed care, it's critical that participants have both consent and bodily autonomy, said Andrew Kerbs, who holds a master's degree in clinical mental health counseling. But during his time as a clinical intern at Trails Carolina, he saw neither.\n\n\"Those are two things that are completely robbed of the kids that are being sent to these programs,\" said Kerbs, who worked for the program in 2016.\n\nHe doesn’t believe using a punishment-based model is helpful, either.\n\n“Whether that's the intention or not is besides the point. Intentions are important, but impact is still the most important … and a lot of kids are coming out of these feeling like it was a punishment. They didn't have a choice.”\n\nPrograms may take in kids dealing with a laundry list of challenges, from rebellious behavior and video game addictions to eating disorders and violent tendencies. And then, Cook says some programs may often attempt to resolve issues in group therapy that may rely on tactics like \"attack therapy,\" in which one child is singled out to discuss their struggle. Experts agree this approach is not the preferred solution.\n\nIf programs pathologize some teen behaviors, parents are often frightened, leaving them to feel as if sending their kid away is their only option. This messaging may be underscored by consultants recommending the programs.\n\n\"Instead of saying to a parent, 'Your kid is starting to have sex, and I know that's scary, but here's what we can do to better support them.' They're saying, 'Oh my God, they're gonna end up as a prostitute. You better send them away so they don't end up pole dancing,'\" says Meg Appelgate, co-founder and CEO of the prevention organization Unsilenced, who also holds a degree in psychology.\n\nIt's normal for preteens and teenagers to push limits as they establish their identity.\n\n\"They're testing out what it feels like to be independent, what it feels like to make your own decisions,\" she says. \"During these times you're going to see kids sneaking out, breaking the rules ... going against authority.\"\n\nShe urges parents to understand the implications of labeling their child as \"troubled\" or \"a problem.\"\n\nA survivor of the troubled teen industry herself, she cautions, \"It really follows you throughout your life.\"\n\nThe lasting impact of wilderness therapy\n\nAppelgate still lives with the effects of the treatment program she attended at 15. She wakes up to panic attacks because she was abducted in the middle of the night to be transported to her program. She eats quickly because otherwise she wouldn't have a chance to get more food.\n\n\"It becomes habit,\" she says. \"These little things that they think aren't affecting kids are highly affecting them.\"\n\nThrough Appelgate's work, she has seen wilderness therapy survivors suffering with a variety of mental health challenges, from post-traumatic stress disorder to anxiety and depression.\n\nAfter being cut off from the world, it can be difficult to reintegrate into society. Relationships can suffer, including between a parent and child. A strong distrust in authority figures can form.\n\n\"Trauma, even though it may be one incident, can certainly cause pervasive long-lasting damage in many areas of life that may seem wholly unrelated to the causal incident,\" Manly says.\n\nAppelgate sees trauma coming from two main sources, from the experience itself and from being sent away and forced to live without a support system.\n\n\"Some people legitimately may have a good experience. I think that for 99% (of people), that's not the case,\" Appelgate says.\n\nThis is because the same event can be perceived differently depending on the person. One child may experience something as traumatic while another doesn't, Manly explains.\n\nResearch shows stress affects the nervous system and can even cause structural changes in the brain, which can change how we think and alter our memory. Stress can also weaken our immune system and exacerbate preexisting health conditions like cardiovascular disease or respiratory problems.\n\n\"The earlier (in life) the trauma, typically the more impactful it's going to be and the longer lasting impact we're going to see from that trauma,\" says Whitney Goodman, licensed psychotherapist and author of \"Toxic Positivity.\"\n\nChronic stress:Your body is trying to tell you something\n\n‘What happened ... shaped my entire personality’\n\nPrograms do a \"really good job of explaining things away to parents,\" Appelgate says, whether it's a negative review (look at the positive ones, too!), an active investigation or even a death.\n\nThey do this by telling parents they've changed policies so a certain incident \"won't happen again,\" blaming it on staffers whom they've since fired or changing the name of a program to escape bad PR. Katelyn's program, for example, used to be named Second Nature Entrada but went through a rebrand in 2015 after years of abuse allegations.\n\nPlus, experts question whether improvement in a child based on forced change equates to actual improvement.\n\n\"You can create compliance through punitive measures, but that's not equipping somebody with the resources to show up in the world as an autonomous adult,\" Kerbs says.\n\nWith more than 75,000 pieces of information on more than 3,500 programs (both shuttered and operating), Unsilenced says its searchable program archive is helping to force transparency by making info easily available for both parents and survivors.\n\nBut there's an urgent need for federal oversight, advocates say.\n\nLooking back on their experiences, Kyra and Katelyn's voices have strengthened, aided by the community of survivors they've bonded with online. TikTok has served as an informal support group, with the hashtag #wildernesstherapy garnering millions of views.\n\nBut for Kyra, the anxiety and depression she entered camp with never improved. On top of that, she was diagnosed with PTSD and her relationship with her parents disintegrated.\n\n\"I just didn't trust them,\" she says. \"I didn't want to tell them anything I was struggling with.\"\n\nKatelyn remembers thinking that once she was back home, things were going to get better and \"everything was going to be perfect.\"\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nWilderness didn't help her eating disorder. After being released from both her programs, she had the hardest relapse she'd ever had.\n\nNow living in Orange Country, California, a senior in college, she has come a long way. But her past still stares her down.\n\n\"What happened to me there has shaped my entire personality,\" she says. She has still struggled with bulimia in the years since her release, and she now suffers from PTSD and manic depression.\n\n\"If anything, I’m so much worse off after these programs. They ruined my life.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/05/27/retirement-five-stressors/9329991/", "title": "Five top stressors in retirement and how to cope", "text": "Nanci Hellmich\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOh, the retirement years — hours of relaxation, visiting family and doing many of the activities you've always wanted to do. Stress-free at last. Or maybe not.\n\nAlthough some research suggests that retirees experience less stress than when they were working, a lot depends on the person, experts say.\n\nStress in retirement is linked to two key factors: health and financial status, says geriatric expert Richard Schulz, director of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research. \"People who have health problems continue to experience the stresses associated with these problems; financial difficulties also contribute to a stressed retirement experience.\n\n\"Involuntary retirement — due to health problems, downsizing, being fired — is associated with a more negative retirement experience,\" he says.\n\nAmit Sood, author of The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living, says the keys to lowering your stress include creatively tackling your stressors, having an attitude of gratitude, accepting people, especially your spouse, for who they are, and being kind to others and yourself.\n\nSocialization is also a great way to ward off stress, says Steve Brody, a psychologist in Cambria, Calif., who works with retirees. He's the co-author of Renew Your Marriage at Midlife written with his wife, Cathy Brody. \"We are social creatures, so we need to stay connected with others.\"\n\nIt's important to deal with stressors because your chances of a heart attack, stroke, cancer or early death are lower if you have less stress, says Sood, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nFive common stressors in retirement and ways to cope with them:\n\n1. Financial concerns. Many retirees experience stress from living on a fixed income, Brody says. They worry that they won't be able to take care of themselves or their family.\n\nStress-reduction strategy: Beware of \"awfulizing and catastrophizing your situation,\" Brody says. Change your way of thinking. Instead of telling yourself, you won't be able to make ends meet, think, \"I don't have as much money as I'd like, but I have $2,500 a month, and I can live on that.\"\n\nAdds Sood: Be grateful for what you have, and if necessary, simplify your life. You might consider getting a smaller home — it's less expensive and easier to maintain. Consider getting a part-time job.\n\n2. Health worries. Health problems and changes in insurance coverage can create enormous stress, Sood says.\n\nStress-reduction strategy: Take care of your body by eating a healthful diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and getting preventive care, Sood says. Don't become overly focused on your health and spend all your time obsessing about it, he says. Play the hand you have. Embrace life's uncertainties by letting go of the uncontrollable, he says. \"We have to accept the changes happening in the body and be grateful for the good health we have and the medical care we have received.\"\n\n3. Caregiving. You may have to deal with the ill health of your spouse, a parent or other relative, Schulz says. Being a caregiver, particularly for illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease that involve cognitive impairment, has been shown to be extremely stressful. The stress tends to accumulate for long periods of time, years typically, and affects the health and functioning of the retired individual.\n\nStress-reduction strategy: The No. 1 strategy is getting help from others, including relatives, friends and professionals, Schulz says. You should become informed about the condition and how to deal with it. On the positive side, you know you are easing the suffering of someone close to you.\n\n4. Relationship issues. Some people have not reconciled their differences with their spouse or learned to accept the other person for who they are, Sood says. Some retirees feel lonely and isolated after leaving colleagues, and others don't get to spend as much time with their kids and grandkids as they'd like, Brody adds.\n\nStress-reduction strategy: Learn to accept your spouse and others for who they are, Sood says. Work on forgiveness. You don't want to close your life with lots of hurts, he says. \"The magic of retirement is having the time to nurture relationships.\"\n\nOne of the keys to interacting with kids and grandkids is give them space, and when you are with them try to help and support them with their daily chores, he says.\n\nAdds Brody: Adult children have a lot going on in their lives. Being aware of that can help you adjust your expectations so you don't end up nagging them or getting depressed over not seeing them enough.\n\n5. Super-charged changes. This is a time of enormous change. You are leaving your job and friendships with colleagues and finding new things to do, Sood says.\n\nStress-reduction strategy: Realize that your brain's reward center likes variety, so give yourself a variety of experiences, Sood says. \"Let your best friends not be the TV, refrigerator or couch. Let your best friends be real people, books and sports shoes.\"\n\nTreat your first year in retirement as if you are \"interning\" to give yourself time to readjust and set new expectations, he says. Find meaning in new passions, including possibly using your work skills in a new job or volunteer work.\n\nBrody says three keys to a successful retirement are finding a sense of purpose for yourself, structuring your day and replacing the social connections you lost when you retired. Also, if you can retire gradually, going to a half-time job for a year before fully retiring, it's easier to acclimate, he says.\n\nNurture your spiritual values, which may mean developing a deeper connection with your faith, Sood says. \"Live your life fully, and say your 'I love yous' every day.\" Most importantly, do not postpone joy and do not bypass kindness.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/27"}]}

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, June 20th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nToday, Louisiana becomes the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms, plus, how some lawmakers are introducing a slew of bills honoring Donald Trump. And we look at how hundreds of public officials in swing states have undermined or cast out on elections.\n\n♦\n\nLouisiana Public schools will now be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom following a new law signed yesterday by Republican Governor Jeff Landry. It's the first state to take such action and Louisiana's legislation mandates a poster-sized display of the religious rules in large, easily readable font for kindergarten classrooms up to state-funded universities starting in 2025. In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to the Hebrew prophet Moses. Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter, along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religious Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law requiring the commandments be displayed.\n\nMeanwhile, other measures would authorize the hiring of chaplains in school, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents. The governor also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve math skills, and place fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.\n\n♦\n\nRepublicans have introduced a flurry of bills to honor former President Donald Trump in the heat of this year's presidential campaign. I spoke with Dan Morrison, a deputy editor in USA TODAY's Washington bureau for more. Dan, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDan, let's just start here. You wrote about several bills that Republicans are pushing to honor former President Donald Trump. I want to start with the $500 bill, interesting stuff here. How did GOP lawmakers want to involve Trump on this?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nWell, Paul Gosar, who's a firebrand Republican from Arizona and a firm supporter of the former president, has put forward a bill to reissue the $500 bill, which hasn't been in circulation for nearly 80 years, and to boot former President William McKinley from the $500 bill and place Donald Trump on there.\n\nHe acknowledges the symbolic nature of this bill and says what he really wants to do is draw attention to inflation in the US under the Biden administration, and this is his way of doing so. Others might say he's also doing it to draw Trump's attention to his own fealty.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Dan, there are also efforts to get Trump the Congressional Gold Medal. Can you just remind us what is this medal and why do some Republicans argue Trump deserves it?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe Gold Medal is just that, a gold medal that the US Congress can bestow onto eminences of different kinds. The hook here is his foreign policy successes while in office, the key one being mentioned by the representative from Florida who proposed it being the Abraham Accords, which was a number of peace agreements between Israel and different Arab states.\n\nIt's another way of members of Congress trying to bring Trump to the fore in what's proving to be a very hot election year. That's an effort by a Paulina Luna of Florida to have the former president receive this absolutely bipartisan prize that is usually awarded to non-controversial eminences by the US Congress.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd we're also hearing about a push to try and rename a major US airport after Trump. What do we know here, Dan?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nDulles International Airport, it's a major airport in the Washington DC area named for a former Secretary of State, there's been a push to make that the Donald Trump International Airport. Like these other proposals, it's bound to fail, but it raises the proposer's profile in Trump world and maybe helps feed the constituents back home, something to chew on.\n\nAirports are hard to rename. Ronald Reagan didn't get an airport named after him until nearly 10 years after he left office, and he was a very popular president who won two elections by very wide margins.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned, Dan, these gestures do seem largely symbolic. I am curious what the greater significance is here and what lawmakers functionally are aiming to get out of these pushes for these bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe congressional record is thick with symbolic measures, symbolic bills, symbolic resolutions. There are 435 members of Congress and they all have people back home they want to recognize. They have veterans, they have local service organizations that they want to talk up and get them entered into the record.\n\nWhat's different here is that Donald Trump's a former president and he's a candidate for president and he's a convicted felon. And all of that's happening at once in this supercharged atmosphere in which he remains the absolute undisputed kingpin of the Republican Party. And so according to a former Republican member of Congress, this is a good way to catch his eye and let him know that you're thinking of him and supporting him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd finally, are we hearing from Democrats at all in response to this flurry of bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nFutile symbolism goes both ways. After the proposal to rename Dulles International Airport, the Democrats put forward a proposal to rename a federal prison near Miami for Donald Trump, as a sort of jab at the three remaining criminal indictments he faces in addition to his conviction on fraud charges in New York.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Dan Morrison is an editor in the Washington bureau. Thanks for your time, Dan.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me. Take care.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. missed a deadline last night to meet criteria set by CNN to participate in this year's first presidential debate. Conditions included appearing on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also garnering at least 15% of voter support in four separate national polls. Kennedy had received at least 15% and only three accepted polls to date, and by CNN's count had qualified for the ballot in just six states, not enough to win the presidency.\n\nKennedy had argued the TV network's standards were being applied unfairly. His campaign asked that the Federal Election Commission take action and keep CNN, President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump from holding the June 27th debate unless it makes changes. CNN previously said only Biden and Trump had met its conditions to take part ahead of last night's midnight deadline.\n\n♦\n\nMore than 300 public officials in five swing states have undermined or cast doubt on elections. I spoke with USA TODAY Democracy Reporter Erin Mansfield to learn more. Erin, thanks for hopping on.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, let's just start here, what is this new study and what did it find as it pertains to these officials and elections?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nAn organization called Public Wise, they advocate on a representative democracy, they're a little bit left-leaning. They created an index that they call Election Threat. They also use the term \"election denier.\" And basically they looked at people who may have cast doubt on the 2020 election, maybe they cast doubt on 2022. Maybe they have a role where they certify votes and they voted against it, although a lot of these people are state lawmakers who signed on to legislation that the organization says would be anti-Democratic would alter an election outcome.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So you mentioned this a bit, but who exactly are these officials and are there any names or positions that stood out to you?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThere are officials 334 in five swing states, all the big swing states except Nevada. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, over 300 of them. They range from the lieutenant governor of Georgia all the way down to some local officials in Detroit and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThey all have varying amounts of power over elections. There are these canvassing boards in Michigan where one of the members, who's a Republican in the Detroit area, says he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election. Well, that man is going to need to vote to certify the 2024 election, so that's something that this group says they're sounding the alarm on.\n\nThere are two folks in North Carolina in the Charlotte area who voted against certifying a separate election. Now certifying an election is very much just an administrative sign-off. \"Hey, we had 354 votes and then we did our count and we had to count the provisional and we got one more. Now let's certify it.\" And that's it. But prior to 2020, it had really never been a controversial process the way it is now.\n\nAnd so what you have here are folks who served as fake electors. The lieutenant governor in Georgia was a fake elector in that state for Donald Trump. One of the folks on the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which elections for that state, was a fake elector in 2020. So what you have are a lot of people with doubts about whether it's the 2020 election or various elections, and they're in positions of power to influence elections.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAre officials mentioned in this study responding at all to it?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nI reached out to anyone we mentioned and I was not able to get a response. In general, I would say the Republican Party, they have put what they call election integrity front and center on their agenda this year. It's a big thing, you hear Trump talk about it. The local Republican Party in North Carolina, where those two folks I mentioned are located, said it's something that ensures the people's will is accurately reflected. And some people have qualified what they've said in other interviews, but unfortunately, no, they didn't talk to me. I always wish they would.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, for folks wondering what's the big deal here, how worrying is this really for this fall's election?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nWe at USA TODAY, we've been monitoring all kinds of changes that are happening to voting processes and election law because what happened in 2020 was really unprecedented. We're watching to see what might happen in 2024. And what we're definitely seeing and what the study really proves is that you have people in influential election roles in influential states who are casting some of the same kind of doubts you might've heard from members of Congress or the former president.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Erin.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nResearchers have discovered a rare genetic trait that could delay the onset of Alzheimer's in people who face an overwhelming risk of developing the mind-robbing disease. A study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 27 people from an extended Columbian family who carried a genetic variant called Christchurch, developed Alzheimer's disease several years later than expected. The findings build on early research in 2019 from a unique family predisposed to pass on the disease. The researchers found that a woman who had the same genetic trait delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by about three decades. Scientists from Mass General Brigham believed the evidence could be used to develop an Alzheimer's drug that replicates the protective effects of the Christchurch genetic variant. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nMeteorologists warned yesterday that an ongoing heat wave scorching parts of the country is expected to intensify in the coming days, potentially breaking records and impacting more than 135 million people. According to AccuWeather, from the Ohio Valley, to the Mid-Atlantic, to New England, temperatures will reach the 90s and some places could see temperatures into the triple digits. That includes in areas not used to extreme heat like parts of Maine. Meanwhile, daytime temperatures around Pittsburgh are expected to feel like 110 degrees through Saturday. Elsewhere, an enormous storm system sweeping across the Gulf of Mexico strengthened yesterday into tropical storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n♦\n\nToday is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the precise moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky each year and the day with the most daylight. It's also the earliest summer solstice since 1796 when George Washington was president. For our friends in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the opposite. Today is the winter solstice.\n\n♦\n\nGene editing is allowing for scientists to develop breakthrough treatments for some of our most challenging diseases. Tune into The Excerpt later today, beginning at 4:00 PM Eastern Time, when my co-host Dana Taylor talks with the principal investigator of the Department of Hematology at St. Jude's Hospital, Shengdar Tsai, about his work in genome editing and how it could shape the future of medicine.\n\n♦\n\nAnd thanks for listening to The Excerpt.

John Bel Edwards.\n\nSuperintendent of Education Cade Brumley said the new law provided BESE with the authority to enact mask mandates and other standards.\n\n\"I really feel good about our plan,\" Brumley said Saturday in an interview with USA Today Network. \"It's something as a team we've spent countless hours to get right and hand in hand with the Louisiana Department of Health (and others).\n\n\"We wanted to give systems a road map, but at the same time we wanted to provide some degree of flexibility,\" he said.\n\nEdwards also issued a statewide mask mandate for people ages 8 and older beginning Monday.\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry in a letter asked BESE to avoid a mask mandate.\n\n\"We believe that mandating students to wear masks creates a situation that may cross the line on liberty, and also may become a tremendous distraction with enforcement,\" Landry said in his letter.\n\nFollowing is the plan that will be presented to BESE for approval at its 1:30 p.m. Tuesday meeting:\n\nMinimum Requirements for Reopening and Operating School Facilities\n\nGroup Sizes\n\nThe maximum group size that may convene indoors in a single room, irrespective of room size, or outdoors at any given time are as follows: Phase 1, 10 individuals; Phase 2, 25 individuals; and Phase 3, 50 individuals.\n\nGroup Composition\n\nYounger students who are unable to wear face coverings or maintain a physical distance from other students or adults should be assigned static groups. This must include, at a minimum, students in Grade 2 or lower. The static group composition should be maintained for as long as possible over the course of the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nThe composition of a group may change if students are able to maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet from other students and adults in a classroom or indoor setting, to the greatest extent possible.\n\nStudents with disabilities must continue to receive special education and related services in the least restrictive environment. School systems must factor in any additional service providers who may need to enter the classroom, students who receive services outside the classroom (e.g. resource, APE), and/or students who receive services through alternate instructional methods.\n\nThe composition of a group may change if students are able to maintain a physical distance from other students and adults in a classroom or indoor setting, to the greatest extent possible.\n\nPhysical Standards for the use of School Facilities\n\nIf a group convenes indoors, it must convene in a room enclosed by a wall or partition. This includes large rooms, such as a gymnasium or auditorium, which may include more than one group if each group is separated by a wall or partition.\n\nIf groups convene outdoors, a physical barrier is not required, but each group must remain separated.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, schools must limit crowding at entry and exit points and maintain maximum group sizes and physical distance recommendations.\n\nIf a room is used by more than one group in a single day, high-touch surfaces contained in that room must be cleaned before and after use by each group.\n\nMonitoring Students and Adults for Symptoms of COVID-19\n\nEach school must establish an area used to isolate anyone showing signs of being sick. The isolation area must be cleaned after it is occupied by any sick student or adult.\n\nUpon arriving at the school facility, each adult and student must be assessed for symptoms of COVID-19, as defined by the CDC. This includes an initial temperature check.\n\nEnvironmental Cleaning and Personal Hygiene\n\nHigh-touch surfaces must be cleaned multiple times per day, including bathrooms.\n\nStudents must wash or sanitize hands upon arrival at the school, at least every two hours, before and after eating, before and after using outdoor play equipment and before exiting the school facility.\n\nWhile inside the school facility, all adults and students in grades 3 through 12 must wear a face covering to the greatest extent possible and practical within the local community context.\n\nWhile inside the school facility, students in grades prekindergarten through 2 may wear a face covering.\n\nWhile inside the school facility, children under two years old and individuals with breathing difficulties should not wear a face covering.\n\nHygienic Supplies\n\nSchool employees must be provided adequate access to hygienic supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectant wipes or spray, paper towels, and tissues.

The Covenant School shooter, armed with two assault-like rifles and a handgun, killed the head of school, a teacher, a custodian and three 9-year-old students. As the bill awaits action in the House, students, parents and others are staging vocal protests against allowing teachers to carry guns at school.\n\nBut Tennessee is far from alone in a nation plagued with deadly school shootings. Here is a closer look at laws in other states governing guns in schools.\n\nWhich states allow teachers to carry firearms on school grounds?\n\nMore than half of all states have some type of law allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed guns on campus, according to data compiled by the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIowa is the most recent state to push for more guns, with lawmakers this week sending a bill to the governor that would allow teachers and other school employees to obtain permits to carry guns on school grounds.\n\nJust 16 states and the District of Columbia have laws specifically prohibiting teachers from carrying guns - Alabama, California, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nMost states, including Tennessee, allow non-law enforcement school security to carry guns on campus, and of the states that allow teachers and other school employees to carry guns, many require permission from the school district.\n\nSpotlight on teacher gun laws\n\nCalifornia, a state with some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, allows non-law enforcement to carry guns without needing permission from the school district, but it prohibits teachers and other school employees from carrying them.\n\nTexas, Florida, Arizona, Mississippi and South Dakota allow teachers and other employees to carry if they are designated school guardians or part of a program.\n\nTennessee and Arkansas prohibit teachers in public schools from carrying guns but allow exemptions for private schools.\n\nSix states - Delaware, Nebraska, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Maine - prohibit guns for non-law enforcement school security, teachers and other staff.\n\nWhat do schools allow for the general public?\n\nMost states prohibit members of the general public from carrying guns on campus, but a handful - Kansas Michigan Mississippi New Hampshire Oregon Utah and Wyoming - allow the guns if the individual has a concealed carry permit.\n\nJust over half of all states allow people with concealed carry permits to keep loaded, unlocked guns in their cars on campus.\n\nHow would Tennessee's law arming teachers work?\n\nTennessee’s law would allow facilities or staff to carry concealed guns on their respective campuses. The state already allows non-law enforcement school security to carry.\n\nThe individual would have to get permission from the district and a law enforcement agency. The district would not be required to notify parents if a gun is in their child’s classroom.\n\nA teacher would have to follow these additional requirements:\n\nHave a valid handgun carry permit\n\nUndergo a background check\n\nComplete 40 hours of additional training\n\nPass a psychological evaluation\n\nHow would Iowa's bill arming teachers work?\n\nLawmakers in Iowa introduced legislation after a deadly shooting at Perry High School in January, when a high school student shot and killed sixth-grader Ahmir Jolliff and Principal Dan Marburger and wounded half a dozen others before fatally shooting himself.\n\nThe legislation sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds this week would allow teachers and other school employees to obtain permits to carry guns on school grounds and grant them qualified immunity for using reasonable force.\n\n\"Time and math do not lie,\" said Rep. Phil Thompson, R-Boone, the bill's manager on the Iowa House floor said. \"The first 30 seconds in these scenarios are extremely critical. This bill does set a high standard for districts and staff that want to participate in this and go the extra mile to protect our kids.\"\n\nThose who want to carry firearms at school under the bill would have to go through a permit process that includes one-time, in-person legal training covering qualified immunity, emergency medical training and communication training, as well as quarterly firearm training and annual \"live scenario\" training.\n\nOpponents say arming teachers will lead to accidental shootings\n\nGun violence prevention groups have held protests and spoken out against the legislation, saying it will make students and school employees less safe by increasing the likelihood of accidents involving guns in schools.\n\n\"It does nothing to protect children who might be the victim of crossfires, of accidents, of a gun not being properly stored or a curious student finding a gun and accidentally injuring other children,\" said Iowa, Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames.\n\nA 2023 report from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence documented about 100 incidents of guns being mishandled, left in reach of children or accidentally discharged at schools over the last five years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2019/09/03/kentucky-school-systems-differ-in-approach-to-in-god-we-trust/2088622001/", "title": "'In God We Trust' is required at Kentucky schools.

The city purchased facial recognition software in July 2017 for just over $1 million.\n\nWillie Burton, one of the three commissioners who voted against the traffic directive, agreed with Petty stating that it was impossible to isolate the two directives.\n\n\"It was all presented together and now all of a sudden they want to separate it because they knew the community was coming out to speak against it,\" said Burton.\n\nIn a rundown of what occurred around the facial recognition directive and why it got pushed back, Gregory Hicks, the board's secretary, explained that the commissioners responded to the original facial recognition directive with 17 recommendations and Assistant Police Chief James White responded with the approval of all but two. The changes were then incorporated in the directive but \"at last minute the department requested to pull back\" the facial recognition vote.\n\nHicks said he does not know why the department pulled the directive and that as of now there is no new date for a vote.\n\nBoth directives involve the \"Neighborhood Real-Time Intelligence Program,\" a new $9 million initiative that Duggan announced in March at his State of the City address. Using local and federal traffic modernization funds, the city will put high-definition cameras at various intersections in the neighborhoods. They will be monitored by Detroit Public Works staff at the Real Time Crime Center within the Detroit Police Department's Public Safety headquarters downtown.\n\nBy the end of 2019, cameras are set to be installed at 11 intersections on the Greenfield and East Seven Mile corridors. Additionally, the Department of Public Works will add cameras to 29 intersections across the city. In 2020, an additional 400 cameras will be added.\n\n“These are the traffic cameras we’re putting up. We will get shots of the perpetrators as they go past and we’ll be able to chase them down,” Duggan said at his State of the City.\n\nUnder the traffic-light directive that passed Thursday, Detroit police are prohibited from using the footage or images from the traffic light cameras to enforce traffic misdemeanors or pedestrian laws or to issue civil infractions of any kind. The cameras cannot be used to assess immigration status or engage in immigration enforcement. And DPD cannot use audio from the cameras unless there is a verified court order.\n\nFootage and images obtained from the traffic light-mounted cameras can be used for \"legitimate law enforcement purposes,\" defined as investigations into criminal activity, the pursuit of a criminal suspect, the monitoring of an ongoing situation \"in which criminal activity is, or is reasonably expected to occur.\"\n\nDPD is not prohibited from focusing cameras on handbills, flyers or other materials carried pursuant to the First Amendment, but they will \"avoid\" doing this.\n\nWhile some checks are in place, critics remain concerned, especially when considering the yet to be voted on directive that deals with facial recognition.\n\nWorries hit on privacy and the silencing of free speech to the actual efficacy of the technology.\n\nLast year, the American Civil Liberties Union of California tested images of members of Congress on \"Rekognition\" — Amazon's facial recognition tool. The organization found that of the 535 faces inputted, the software falsely matched 28 with people who had been arrested on criminal charges. Additionally, the software gave false matches for 39% of the minority members, who comprise only 20% of Congress.\n\nSuch issues were raised in a May inter-office memo sent to the commissioners. The document cited a January report that found that facial recognition technology showed a lower accuracy rate for African Americans and another that found that artificial intelligence assigned more criminal intent to black men based on difficulties interpreting emotions of black faces.\n\n\"That is enough to justify voting against it,\" said Eric Williams, an attorney working with the ACLU on a committee opposing the city's surveillance tactics. \"If it said this for white men and women, this wouldn't even be considered.\"\n\nLast month, San Francisco — seen by many as the center of the tech-universe — became the first major city to ban police use of the technology, citing several of the concerns Williams and other critics of the software have raised.\n\n\"We have an outsize responsibility to regulate the excesses of technology precisely because they are headquartered here,\" Aaron Peskin, the city supervisor who sponsored the bill, told the New York Times at the time.\n\nThis point was raised by Petty during her public comment Thursday.\n\n\"The very technologists who created it said it’s harmful and biased. It doesn’t recognize darker skins,\" she said referencing an AI experiment that failed to recognize Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"I have to push you all to at least understand the technology you’re implementing,\" she continued. \"This will be the largest experiment on black people in the United States — 700,000 black people being submitted to an experiment that has already failed all over the world.\"\n\nWhile the directives in question have been discussed in relation to the Neighborhood Real-Time Intelligence Program — the use of such technology and surveillance is not new in Detroit. This is just the latest surveillance project in an ever-expanding network.\n\nThe public-facing push to ramp up surveillance began in January 2016 when DPD launched Project Green Light. Starting with eight gas stations, the program has participating businesses pay for and install surveillance cameras on their property that feed directly to DPD's Real Time Crime Center. Additionally, as part of the program, businesses commit to ensuring they have robust lighting and a green light outside of their vicinity to let customers know they are a part of the program.\n\nToday, more than 500 businesses — including churches, schools, and pharmacies — are a part of the program. There are also two \"Green Light Corridors\" and one public housing property signed on to be part of the program.\n\nPrior to the launch of Project Green Light, however, city officials were thinking about surveillance and specifically facial recognition software.\n\nIn fall 2015, Detroit's Office of Contracting and Procurement was working on a request for proposal for \"Facial Recognition Software solutions\" to be utilized by DPD's Real Time Crime Center (live video feeds) and investigation personnel (static images).\n\nIn July 2017, the city entered into a three-year, $1,045,843, contract with South Carolina-based facial recognition software company DataWorks Plus, which pitched FACE Watch Plus in its bid for the contract.\n\n\"FACE Watch Plus tracks face images from live video surveillance, processes the images, then searches your database and alerts you when a match/hit has been made,\" the proposal explained. \"It detects faces within surveillance footage in real-time, then uses cutting-edge facial searching algorithms to rapidly search through your agency's mugshot or watchlist database for positive matches.\"\n\nThe 2017 contract, which expired on Wednesday, explained that the purchase of facial recognition licensing, software and equipment was for \"Project Green Light Locations.\"\n\nDespite this stated use, a May report from Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology noted that nowhere on the Green Light website was the use of face recognition, real-time face surveillance, or any kind of automated face analysis technology mentioned.\n\nThis, according to Clare Garvie, a senior associate at the center and co-author of the report, is a problem.\n\n\"It should be up to communities to decide whether the benefits of face recognition outweigh the risks and whether these benefits to public safety mean that this technology can and should be used on them,\" said Garvie.\n\n\"What we found in Detroit is the decision to purchase not just face recognition — the ability to do investigations using face recognition — but the ability to do face surveillance was not something that was ever presented to the public,\" she continued. \"It never appears to be presented to the Project Green Light partners, and yes that is absolutely a discussion that should have taken place before the city spends over a million dollars on a system.\"\n\nFor some of the Detroiters in attendance at the vote Thursday, the delay seemed to exacerbate questions of accountability.\n\n\"If you can’t even conduct a vote with integrity,\" asked Janice Gates, \"how do you expect us to believe that you will use facial recognition with integrity?\"\n\nDetroiter Eric Blount echoed her sentiments.\n\n\"It feels like this meeting agenda switch is a sleight of hand switch, so many people came out here thinking they were going to understand and better express themselves on facial recognition and a last-minute switch,\" Blount said. \"I just ask you to stick to the agenda, if there is any possibility that it will be changed, do it far in advance, because these meetings are very inconvenient for most people who have to work.\"\n\nContact Allie Gross: AEGross@freepress.com.

The findings build on early research in 2019 from a unique family predisposed to pass on the disease. The researchers found that a woman who had the same genetic trait delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by about three decades.\n\nScientists from Mass General Brigham believe the evidence could be used to develop an Alzheimer's drug or medication that replicates the protective effects of the Christchurch genetic variant.\n\n\"We have enough evidence, and now the focus should be on trying to leverage this discovery to our therapies,\" said Dr. Joseph Arboleda-Velasquez, a scientist at Mass General Brigham who co-authored the study. The aim is huge, he said: \"How can we learn from the protective effects of Christchurch to develop new therapies that will help everybody?\"\n\nWhy did researchers focus on a family in Colombia?\n\nThe research was isolated to South America where the participants worked with a rare set of data. More than 1,000 members of an extended family in Colombia carry a genetic mutation that puts them at near certain risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The symptoms usually begin when the relatives are in their mid-40s. The mutation carriers are part of an extended family of about 6,000 people who live in and around Medellin, Colombia. In the 1980s, a University of Antioquia neurologist, Francisco Lopera, discovered the family had been afflicted with this inherited mutation, passed from generation to generation, for decades. Using advances in genetic testing, doctors identified the inherited mutation that triggered early-onset Alzheimer's in these family members. It was called the Paisa mutation, named after the inhabitants of the region.\n\nWhat did this study examine?\n\nFrom 1995 through 2022, researchers from the University of Antioquia in Medellin collected detailed information about the family members who participated in a series of medical studies. The family members underwent medical exams, genetic testing and neuropsychological assessments.\n\nResearchers examined detailed information of family members who carried the Paisa mutation. Researchers knew the Paisa mutation carriers typically developed memory and thinking problems in their mid-40s and typically died more than a decade later.\n\nIn 2019, researchers discovered a woman who carried the Paisa mutation and did not experience symptoms of Alzheimer's until she reached her 70s – about three decades later than the symptoms have typically appeared among Paisa mutation carriers. Genetic testing revealed this woman also had two copies of the Alzheimer's gene APOE3 variant, called the Christchurch variant.\n\nIn the study published this week, researchers examined whether Christchurch offered extra protection to people who also have the Paisa mutation. They found 27 people with the Paisa mutation and one copy of the Christchurch variant. Those individuals preserved normal memory and thinking longer than a comparable group who just had the Paisa mutation.\n\nThe group that only had Paisa showed signs of disease at a median age of 47, while people who carried Christchurch and Paisa did not exhibit memory and thinking problems until they were 52 - five years later.\n\nYakeel T. Quiroz, a study co-author and clinical neuropsychologist and neuroimaging researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the research findings \"suggest the potential for delaying cognitive decline and dementia in older individuals.\"\n\nQuiroz added the findings can be used to develop effective treatments to prevent Alzheimer's dementia.\n\nWhat's next for drug development?\n\nArboleda-Velasquez, who works as a Harvard Medical School associate professor of ophthalmology, said his laboratory is using these study findings to develop potential antibody drugs to combat Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHis goal is to begin testing medications in human clinical trials by 2026.\n\nEric Reiman, executive director at Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix and a co-author of the study, said the study bolsters the \"idea that this rare variant of the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease plays a protective role in the development of Alzheimer's.\"\n\nReiman said further research is needed into the underlying role of APOE on hallmarks of the disease, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles found in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nThe Christchurch study \"provides further support for the idea of targeting APOE in the treatment and potential prevention of Alzheimer's disease.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/20/louisiana-require-ten-commandments-classroom-the-excerpt/74155535007/", "title": "Louisiana to require Ten Commandments in the classroom | The ...", "text": "On Thursday’s episode of The Excerpt podcast: Louisiana becomes the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, June 20th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nToday, Louisiana becomes the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms, plus, how some lawmakers are introducing a slew of bills honoring Donald Trump. And we look at how hundreds of public officials in swing states have undermined or cast out on elections.\n\n♦\n\nLouisiana Public schools will now be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom following a new law signed yesterday by Republican Governor Jeff Landry. It's the first state to take such action and Louisiana's legislation mandates a poster-sized display of the religious rules in large, easily readable font for kindergarten classrooms up to state-funded universities starting in 2025. In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to the Hebrew prophet Moses. Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter, along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religious Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law requiring the commandments be displayed.\n\nMeanwhile, other measures would authorize the hiring of chaplains in school, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents. The governor also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve math skills, and place fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.\n\n♦\n\nRepublicans have introduced a flurry of bills to honor former President Donald Trump in the heat of this year's presidential campaign. I spoke with Dan Morrison, a deputy editor in USA TODAY's Washington bureau for more. Dan, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDan, let's just start here. You wrote about several bills that Republicans are pushing to honor former President Donald Trump. I want to start with the $500 bill, interesting stuff here. How did GOP lawmakers want to involve Trump on this?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nWell, Paul Gosar, who's a firebrand Republican from Arizona and a firm supporter of the former president, has put forward a bill to reissue the $500 bill, which hasn't been in circulation for nearly 80 years, and to boot former President William McKinley from the $500 bill and place Donald Trump on there.\n\nHe acknowledges the symbolic nature of this bill and says what he really wants to do is draw attention to inflation in the US under the Biden administration, and this is his way of doing so. Others might say he's also doing it to draw Trump's attention to his own fealty.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Dan, there are also efforts to get Trump the Congressional Gold Medal. Can you just remind us what is this medal and why do some Republicans argue Trump deserves it?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe Gold Medal is just that, a gold medal that the US Congress can bestow onto eminences of different kinds. The hook here is his foreign policy successes while in office, the key one being mentioned by the representative from Florida who proposed it being the Abraham Accords, which was a number of peace agreements between Israel and different Arab states.\n\nIt's another way of members of Congress trying to bring Trump to the fore in what's proving to be a very hot election year. That's an effort by a Paulina Luna of Florida to have the former president receive this absolutely bipartisan prize that is usually awarded to non-controversial eminences by the US Congress.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd we're also hearing about a push to try and rename a major US airport after Trump. What do we know here, Dan?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nDulles International Airport, it's a major airport in the Washington DC area named for a former Secretary of State, there's been a push to make that the Donald Trump International Airport. Like these other proposals, it's bound to fail, but it raises the proposer's profile in Trump world and maybe helps feed the constituents back home, something to chew on.\n\nAirports are hard to rename. Ronald Reagan didn't get an airport named after him until nearly 10 years after he left office, and he was a very popular president who won two elections by very wide margins.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned, Dan, these gestures do seem largely symbolic. I am curious what the greater significance is here and what lawmakers functionally are aiming to get out of these pushes for these bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe congressional record is thick with symbolic measures, symbolic bills, symbolic resolutions. There are 435 members of Congress and they all have people back home they want to recognize. They have veterans, they have local service organizations that they want to talk up and get them entered into the record.\n\nWhat's different here is that Donald Trump's a former president and he's a candidate for president and he's a convicted felon. And all of that's happening at once in this supercharged atmosphere in which he remains the absolute undisputed kingpin of the Republican Party. And so according to a former Republican member of Congress, this is a good way to catch his eye and let him know that you're thinking of him and supporting him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd finally, are we hearing from Democrats at all in response to this flurry of bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nFutile symbolism goes both ways. After the proposal to rename Dulles International Airport, the Democrats put forward a proposal to rename a federal prison near Miami for Donald Trump, as a sort of jab at the three remaining criminal indictments he faces in addition to his conviction on fraud charges in New York.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Dan Morrison is an editor in the Washington bureau. Thanks for your time, Dan.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me. Take care.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. missed a deadline last night to meet criteria set by CNN to participate in this year's first presidential debate. Conditions included appearing on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also garnering at least 15% of voter support in four separate national polls. Kennedy had received at least 15% and only three accepted polls to date, and by CNN's count had qualified for the ballot in just six states, not enough to win the presidency.\n\nKennedy had argued the TV network's standards were being applied unfairly. His campaign asked that the Federal Election Commission take action and keep CNN, President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump from holding the June 27th debate unless it makes changes. CNN previously said only Biden and Trump had met its conditions to take part ahead of last night's midnight deadline.\n\n♦\n\nMore than 300 public officials in five swing states have undermined or cast doubt on elections. I spoke with USA TODAY Democracy Reporter Erin Mansfield to learn more. Erin, thanks for hopping on.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, let's just start here, what is this new study and what did it find as it pertains to these officials and elections?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nAn organization called Public Wise, they advocate on a representative democracy, they're a little bit left-leaning. They created an index that they call Election Threat. They also use the term \"election denier.\" And basically they looked at people who may have cast doubt on the 2020 election, maybe they cast doubt on 2022. Maybe they have a role where they certify votes and they voted against it, although a lot of these people are state lawmakers who signed on to legislation that the organization says would be anti-Democratic would alter an election outcome.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So you mentioned this a bit, but who exactly are these officials and are there any names or positions that stood out to you?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThere are officials 334 in five swing states, all the big swing states except Nevada. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, over 300 of them. They range from the lieutenant governor of Georgia all the way down to some local officials in Detroit and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThey all have varying amounts of power over elections. There are these canvassing boards in Michigan where one of the members, who's a Republican in the Detroit area, says he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election. Well, that man is going to need to vote to certify the 2024 election, so that's something that this group says they're sounding the alarm on.\n\nThere are two folks in North Carolina in the Charlotte area who voted against certifying a separate election. Now certifying an election is very much just an administrative sign-off. \"Hey, we had 354 votes and then we did our count and we had to count the provisional and we got one more. Now let's certify it.\" And that's it. But prior to 2020, it had really never been a controversial process the way it is now.\n\nAnd so what you have here are folks who served as fake electors. The lieutenant governor in Georgia was a fake elector in that state for Donald Trump. One of the folks on the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which elections for that state, was a fake elector in 2020. So what you have are a lot of people with doubts about whether it's the 2020 election or various elections, and they're in positions of power to influence elections.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAre officials mentioned in this study responding at all to it?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nI reached out to anyone we mentioned and I was not able to get a response. In general, I would say the Republican Party, they have put what they call election integrity front and center on their agenda this year. It's a big thing, you hear Trump talk about it. The local Republican Party in North Carolina, where those two folks I mentioned are located, said it's something that ensures the people's will is accurately reflected. And some people have qualified what they've said in other interviews, but unfortunately, no, they didn't talk to me. I always wish they would.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, for folks wondering what's the big deal here, how worrying is this really for this fall's election?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nWe at USA TODAY, we've been monitoring all kinds of changes that are happening to voting processes and election law because what happened in 2020 was really unprecedented. We're watching to see what might happen in 2024. And what we're definitely seeing and what the study really proves is that you have people in influential election roles in influential states who are casting some of the same kind of doubts you might've heard from members of Congress or the former president.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY.

A study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 27 people from an extended Columbian family who carried a genetic variant called Christchurch, developed Alzheimer's disease several years later than expected. The findings build on early research in 2019 from a unique family predisposed to pass on the disease. The researchers found that a woman who had the same genetic trait delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by about three decades.

Oddly, that’s a good thing: It’s a sign you still have a working sense of smell – even if it’s miswired in your brain.\n\nYour ability to smell can also disappear completely, a condition called anosmia. Without warning, you can no longer inhale the sweet odor of your baby’s skin, the roses gifted by your partner or the pungent stink of your exercise clothes.\n\nTaste and smell are intertwined, so food may be bland or flavorless. Appetite and enjoyment of life may plummet, which past studies show can lead to nutritional deficits, cognitive decline and depression.\n\nDanger lurks as well. Without smell, you may not recognize the telltale signs of fires, natural gas leaks, poisonous chemicals or spoiled food and drink.\n\nSuch is the reality of some 5% of global Covid-19 survivors who have now developed long-lasting taste and smell problems, according to a 2022 study. More than two years into the pandemic, researchers found an estimated 15 million people may still have problems perceiving odors, while 12 million may struggle with taste.\n\nSupport and advocacy groups such as AbScent and Fifth Sense have mobilized to help, offering affirmation and hope, tips on smell training and even recipes to bolster appetite.\n\nSmell or olfactory training encourages people to sniff essential oils twice a day, said rhinologist Dr. Zara Patel, a professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n“The way I explain it to patients is if you had a stroke, and it made your arm not work, you would go to physical therapy, you would do rehab,” Patel said. “That’s exactly what olfactory training is for your sense of smell.”\n\nAs science learns more about how Covid-19 attacks and disrupts smell, “I think you’re going to see interventions that are more targeted,” said rhinologist Dr. Justin Turner, an associate professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nAnyone still struggling with a loss of smell and taste “should think positively and assume their sense of smell will return,” Turner said. “Yes, there are some people that won’t recover, so for those folks, we want them to not ignore it. We want them to take it seriously.”\n\nCases exploded due to Covid-19\n\nPeople have been losing their sense of smell and taste for centuries. Common cold and flu viruses, nasal polyps, thyroid disorders, severe allergies, sinus infections and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis can all damage the ability to smell and taste – at times, permanently.\n\nSo can head trauma, exposure to noxious chemicals, cancer treatments, smoking, gum disease, antibiotics and various blood pressure, cholesterol, reflux and allergy medications, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSome people who have had Covid-19 suffer long-term problems with their sense of smell. Adobe Stock\n\nGrowing old is a major cause of smell loss as the ability of the olfactory neurons to regenerate declines. A study conducted in 1984 found more than 50% of people between ages 65 and 80 years suffered from “major olfactory impairment.” The number climbed to more than 75% for people over age 80.\n\nWhen the virus that causes Covid-19 invaded our lives, a condition that was relatively rare among people under 50 expanded exponentially, affecting all ages.\n\n“Covid-19 affected younger people much more than other forms of post-viral smell loss,” said surgeon Dr. Eric Holbrook, an associate professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Harvard Medical School. “You wouldn’t see much smell loss in the pediatric population, for example, and now it’s very common.”\n\nIn fact, loss of smell was so prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic it was considered the canary in the coal mine – an early sign of Covid-19 infection even in the absence of other symptoms.\n\nThat’s not true today. A study published in May found 17% of people lost their sense of smell when infected with the Omicron variant, which became the predominant variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 in late 2021. (This could change again if the virus mutates.)\n\nIn comparison, people sickened by the two original variants, Alpha and Beta, were 50% more likely to lose their sense of smell or taste. Delta was nearly as bad – 44% of people were affected, according to the study.\n\nStatistics show most people recover their sense of taste and smell. An August analysis of 267 people who lost smell and taste at least two years ago found the majority either fully (38.2%) or partially (54.3%) recovered their ability to smell and taste. That was especially true for people under 40, according to the study.\n\nBut 7.5% had not recovered their sense of smell and taste two years after their Covid-19 infection cleared. Those who were least likely to recover included people with existing nasal congestion, more women than men, and those who had a greater initial severity of smell loss, the study found.\n\nHow damage occurs\n\nHow does Covid-19 damage the olfactory system? At first scientists believed it infected neurons in the nose responsible for transmitting smells from the environment into the brain. Those neurons sit in the olfactory bulbs at the very top of each nostril and send out axons, or cables, to unique sensory spots in the brain.\n\nSoon studies discovered the virus does not enter those neurons at all. Instead, it attacks sustentacular cells, also known as supporting cells, which provide nourishment and protection to nerve cells from birth. Unlike many other cells, neurons in the nose undergo rebirth every two to three months.\n\n“(Covid-19) infection of those supporting cells likely has some sort of long-term effect on the ability of those neurons to regenerate themselves with time,” Turner said.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons we sometimes see a delayed effect: People may have some smell loss that recovers, then later they have a second wave of smell loss, parosmia or other symptoms because that regenerative capacity is malfunctioning,” he said.\n\nParosmia is the medical term for distorted smells, which can often be quite disgusting, Patel said.\n\n“Unfortunately, there’s these classic categories of really terrible smells and tastes,” she said. “Sometimes it’s feces, garbage or old dirty socks. There can be a sort of sickly, sweet chemical type of smell and taste. Oh, and rotting flesh is another common category.”\n\nFor many people, parosmia tends to occur or reoccur at the three-month mark, about the time olfactory neurons would naturally be regenerating, experts told CNN.\n\n“If the reconnection misses its target and hits a different spot in the brain reserved for a different odor, your perception of smell is going to be totally screwed up,” Holbrook said.\n\n“You have to rely on the ability for those axons to retract and then find their way to the right spot,” he added. “Or if they’re not correct, wait for those neurons to die off and have new ones come back and find the right spot.”\n\nScience continues to discover ways the virus attacks. A study from February found it may also damage olfactory receptors that sit on the surface of nerve cells in the nose. Those receptors bind smells and trigger the nerve impulses that transmit the information to the brain.\n\nThere may also be a genetic component. A January study discovered a mutation in two overlapping genes, UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, that play a role in metabolizing odors. People with that mutation may be more susceptible to losing their sense of smell, but further studies are needed to determine the virus’s association to the genes – if any.\n\nPeople who are older and have chronic diseases that affect the nervous system, such as diabetes, are often more susceptible to olfactory damage, Patel said.\n\n“It’s the very small vessels in the body, including the nose, that are affected by diabetes, disturbing blood, nutrient and oxygen flow to these olfactory nerves,” she said. “People with chronic sinus or allergy inflammation in the nose – anything that makes it harder for our system to bounce back will likely be at higher risk as well.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/health/childrens-hospital-beds-delayed-care-long-waits/index.html", "title": "While respiratory viruses surge, shortage of pediatric hospital beds ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nParents who need to take a child to the emergency room are facing agonizing waits in many parts of the United States because of a shortage of hospital beds.\n\nHospitals across the country say they are being overwhelmed by an early surge in respiratory infections including RSV, influenza and enterovirus. As a result, pediatric hospital beds are more full now than they have been in the past two years, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThis crush of young patients filling hospitals now means those with less urgent illnesses may face long waits and sometimes days-long stays in the ER while they wait to be admitted. It also means kids who need cancer treatment or surgery may be sent home to wait until hospitals have beds.\n\nPediatric beds are so full in San Antonio that Elena Mikalsen drove her 17-year-old daughter to an emergency room 45 minutes away in the hopes that she could be seen more quickly there. She knew hospitals closer to home were already full.\n\nHer daughter hasn’t been able to eat or drink since Thursday because of a sharp pain in her abdomen that gets worse after she eats. Last week, she began vomiting and having chills.\n\nAfter blood tests and an ultrasound in the ER, doctors determined that she needed to have her gallbladder removed. It was full of gallstones.\n\n“What’s happened with my daughter is, she should have been admitted last night, as someone who can’t eat or drink and is in pain and is a child,” Mikalsen said Monday.\n\nNormally in a case like this, the hospital would put the person on the surgery schedule and keep her hydrated and comfortable until the procedure. But there aren’t any available beds, so her daughter is waiting at home.\n\nMikalsen knows this process intimately because in addition to being a worried mom, she works in health care.\n\nShe asked CNN not to name her employer because she wasn’t authorized to speak on their behalf. She also asked not to use her daughter’s name to protect her privacy.\n\n“We don’t want to take a bed away from a baby, because that’s what’s really happening right now,” Mikalsen said. “Very little ones coming in who are suffocating, so they need all the beds.”\n\nFor now, her daughter is resting at home and taking medication to relieve the pain.\n\nThere are risks involved with delaying the surgery. Gallstones can block the the tiny tubes that carry the digestive juices that are made by the gallbladder to the small intestine. That may lead to an swelling, intense pain and an infection, which can trigger sepsis.\n\n“It is nerve-wracking,” Mikalsen said. “We had the surgeon on the phone last night and the doctor. They ran all kinds of tests on her in the ER and they were like, ‘well, she’s not dying. We’re not going to prioritize a bed for her.’ “\n\nMikalsen even tried to get her daughter an adult bed at local hospitals, but they were told she still needs pediatric care. She has a list of symptoms to keep an eye on – signs that her daughter’s condition could be worsening. And they have an upcoming appointment to see a doctor for a consultation, but no promise of upcoming surgery.\n\n“My instructions are strict bed rest, no food, just fluids and pain medication, so that’s what we have to do. She misses school and I miss work until we get this figured out,” Mikalsen said.\n\nUnprecedented numbers of cases\n\nTexas isn’t the only state being impacted. A spokesperson for Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Rhode Island told CNN the hospital is at 125% capacity and has been having issues with bed space for about a month.\n\nSeattle Children’s Hospital says it is seeing double the number patients they would normally see in October. On any given day, for most of the day, it’s at about 200% of its physical capacity in the emergency department.\n\n“RSV is on the rise, and last week 30% of respiratory viral tests in Seattle Children’s Emergency Department were positive for RSV. In the past, when we’ve reached 30-40% positivity, we are at peak, which typically lasts for 2 months,” said Emergency Services Dr. Russell Migita, in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Health alerted hospital systems in the state that they are running out of pediatric intensive care beds. As of Friday, just 6% of the 289 PICU beds remained open statewide.\n\n“That’s actually an optimistic number,” says Dr. Deanna Behrens, a pediatric critical care specialist at a children’s hospital in Chicago. She asked that CNN not identify the hospital because she didn’t have permission from her employer to talk about the shortage.\n\nBehrens says that 289 refers to the number of licensed intensive care beds available, but because of staff shortages, hospitals may not have enough nurses to keep that many beds open for patients.\n\n“It’s like nothing that I’ve ever seen before in the decade that I’ve been doing this in terms of the amount of kids that we have with all these respiratory illnesses,” she said. “The number of kids we are seeing is very unusual.”\n\nBehrens says her hospital has sent children as far as St. Louis for intensive care when it didn’t have available beds.\n\nIt’s the same story in Minneapolis.\n\n“Our total ER volumes are the highest they’ve ever been in our emergency department right now. So our overall number of patients per day,” said Dr. Marissa Hendrickson, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at M Health Fairview Masonic Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis.\n\nNearly all the kids seen there are sick with respiratory viruses, especially RSV.\n\n“We still do our best to get people who are more ill and need more immediate attention back to rooms as quickly as possible,” Hendrickson said. “But sometimes, when things are busy enough, we aren’t even able to do that.\n\n“And then we ended up caring for people in non-traditional spaces like hallways or trying to start their care actually physically in the waiting room. So we’re squeezing people in as best we can,” she said.\n\n‘These hospitals are overwhelmed’\n\nIn Atlanta, Katie McKoy says she recently waited nearly three weeks to get cancer scans for her 14-year-old son, Matthew, who goes by Mattie.\n\nMattie has a rare genetic condition called spinal variant neurofibromatosis type one, which causes tumors to grow on his spinal cord and compress his nerves. Because of where they’re growing, the tumors have paralyzed his diaphragm, the muscle that sits underneath the rib cage and controls breathing. He breathes with the help of a tube in his windpipe and machines.\n\nWith hospital beds in short supply, Mattie McKoy waited weeks for scans he needed. Katie McKoy\n\nMattie’s condition will shorten his life, but McKoy says he could live five or 10 more years with good care. He takes an oral chemotherapy drug to slow the growth of his tumors and to space out his surgeries.\n\nWhen he recently got weaker, his doctors decided it was time for another round of scans.\n\n“We’re using these scans to decide, when is it time for hospice? When is it time for surgery? And to make those really gut-wrenching decisions,” McKoy said.\n\nMattie has to be admitted to the hospital when he goes for imaging. He has autism and can’t stay in the machines without sedation. Because his medical needs are so complex, he needs intensive care during each trip.\n\nMcKoy said Mattie’s most recent set of scans was originally scheduled for September 26, but that appointment was canceled for lack of space.\n\nChildren’s Healthcare of Atlanta has been using surge tents for emergency room overflow since August, when respiratory illnesses began an out-of-season climb. Children’s says the tents are for mild injury and illness, not only RSV patients. Wait times in the emergency department vary through the day but average around three hours or more.\n\nThe doctors started making calls and eventually secured a spot in a hospital bed that would normally have been reserved for someone who needed rehabilitation. The McKoys took it because nursing coverage was better for those beds, but it wasn’t the same level of attention he would have gotten in the intensive care unit.\n\nMattie finally got his scans on October 18.\n\nAlhough his family says they are grateful for the incredible medical team at Children’s, the level of care he needs is very difficult to get right now.\n\n“Other pediatric hospitals are in just as bad of a situation. It’s a nationwide crisis,” McKoy said. “These hospitals are overwhelmed.”\n\nAllyson Wright, a spokesperson for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said that because of patient privacy laws, the hospital can’t comment on the specifics of this case, and “decisions about transferring patients are reassessed daily both within Children’s and with our partner hospitals as needed to ensure that care is provided expeditiously and safely.\n\nIf Mattie’s health suddenly declines, his mom says, she’ll have no choice but to take him to the emergency room for care. His immunity is low because of his underlying health conditions and his cancer treatment, so if he catches an infection while waiting in the ER, it could kill him.\n\n“Honestly, I’m terrified,” McKoy said. “I’m afraid of him dying this flu season because he gets sick and the infrastructure of the hospital system in general isn’t able to care for him because there are so many other sick kids and there’s no bed available for him. That’s my deepest fear.”\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nTo make the most of hospital capacity for kids, public health officials are urging parents to protect their children from respiratory infections by making sure children have recently been vaccinated against Covid-19 and influenza and being cautious to prevent sharing germs.\n\nDoctors who care for kids in the hospital ask parents to seek out their pediatrician, when possible, before heading to a packed ER.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSome children shouldn’t wait. Respiratory symptoms that require urgent medical attention include fast or labored breathing. In a baby, that might mean that their nostrils flare with every breath, or their head may bob as they try to breathe.\n\n“When children are having trouble breathing, they pull in the muscles so that you can see their ribs outline with every breath or you can see their stomach sucking in and out in a way that it doesn’t normally do. Or the muscles in the neck and that go up by their shoulders over the collarbone can pull in with their breath,” said Hendrickson, the pediatric emergency medicine physician in Minneapolis.\n\n“The other thing would be to watch for dehydration. So sometimes, little kids – even a baby with a stuffy nose – can sometimes have trouble drinking. It’s hard to drink a bottle if your nose is stuffy. And so sometimes, they just sort of give up, and they don’t drink enough,” she said.\n\nIt’s OK if they’re not eating, she said, as long as they’re still getting enough fluids.

Bart Classen. A screenshot of the first page accompanies the post and provides an explanation: The messenger RNA, or mRNA, used in the vaccines trigger abnormally shaped proteins, the basis for prion and other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nClassen's paper, first published in January, has been shared elsewhere on Facebook.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the poster and Classen for further comment.\n\nWhat is prion disease?\n\nPrion diseases consist of a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders caused by proteins that have folded abnormally, also known as prion proteins, which trigger normal proteins they come into contact with to also misfold.\n\nUnderlying reasons for the misfolding vary: In some prion diseases like fatal insomnia (FI) or certain types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), it's genetics. In others like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), popularly known as \"mad cow disease,\" it's transmitted by eating infected animal products.\n\nHow exactly prions cause disease starts with the brain: The misfolded proteins accumulate and clump together, causing memory impairment, personality changes and difficulties with movement.\n\nWhile prion diseases have no known cure, there are treatments that can slow or delay symptoms. Since outbreaks of BSE in the 1990s and early 2000s, regulations on how cattle are handled and fed have greatly prevented transmission from animals to humans.\n\nPrion disease and COVID-19 vaccines\n\nContrary to Classen's claim, there is no evidence to suggest the COVID-19 vaccines can cause prion diseases or other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nUSA TODAY found no mention in its review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision memorandums for both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines, which involved clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers. Similarly, no cases have been reported to the federal government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS.\n\n\"VAERS has received no reports of prion-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) after COVID-19 vaccination,\" said Martha Sharan, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to PolitiFact in February. \"No evidence to date indicates a causative association between COVID-19 vaccines and these conditions.\"\n\nDr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University, told USA TODAY Classen's paper held \"no scientific weight at all\" and that the journal his article is published in, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, was \"not a reputable or reliable journal.\" (Microbiology & Infectious Diseases is an open-access journal published by SciVision Publishers, a potential predatory publisher intended for profit rather than academic peer-review.)\n\nDr. David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, echoed Rasmussen in a Feb. 22 blog post for Science-Based Medicine.\n\n\"What we have here is a whole heck of a lot of speculation, with the finding of an obscure connection based on methodology that is not explained with anywhere near the level of rigor a real molecular biology or bioinformatics scientist would require to be convinced,\" Gorski concludes.\n\nIt's worth noting this is not the first time Classen has used \"science\" to claim vaccines do more harm than good. In 1999, he claimed the influenza vaccine caused type 1 diabetes, a claim disproven by Johns Hopkins University's Institute for Vaccine Safety.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that COVID-19 vaccines can cause prion and other neurodegenerative diseases is FALSE, based on our research. The claim originates from a paper (likely not peer-reviewed) published earlier this year that asserts the mRNA component of the vaccine causes prion disease. Neither Pfizer nor Moderna, both of which manufacture mRNA-based vaccines, reported cases of prion or other neurodegenerative diseases. The federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System also has not received any such reports. Scientific experts have said Classen's claim is highly speculative and lacks actual proof.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Some of the biggest literary, dramatic and legal stars have joined the club, which celebrates its 190th anniversary this week. Today, the club reportedly has 1,300 members and a seven-year waiting list.\n\nFounded in 1831 under the patronage of King William IV’s brother, the Duke of Sussex, the Garrick was first formed as a place where “actors and men of refinement and education might meet on equal terms”. It is named after David Garrick, a celebrated 18th-century actor and theatre manager, who popularised a “naturalistic” style of acting still influential today, according to Britannica.\n\nWhat’s it like inside?\n\nThe club boasts dining facilities, a cocktail bar, private dining rooms, accommodation and a theatrical library that claims to include the “most comprehensive collection of theatrical paintings and drawings in existence”, according to its website. There is also a card room, billiards room, reading room and roof terrace.\n\nWriting in The Times last year, Hilary Rose says that “there are liveried porters and an astonishing art collection stacked up to the ceiling in every room.\n\n“There are leather armchairs and strong G&Ts, attentive uniformed waiters and good food. There is dark polished wood, gilded picture frames and antique mahogany tables.”\n\nMen are expected to wear jackets and collared shirts at all times and ties when dining in the Coffee Room, unless arriving after 9.30pm for after-theatre supper, while female guests are permitted to wear trousers but not jeans.\n\nWho are its members?\n\nThe club still chooses members using one of its original tenants, that “it would be better that ten unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted”.\n\nLiterary icons Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, J.M. Barrie, A.A. Milne and Kingsley Amis have all been members of the club, as have composers such as Edward Elgar and influential artists John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The Oldie adds that in 1993 broadcaster Jeremy Paxman was “blackballed by the Garrick Club for being rude to politicians – which was in fact his job”.\n\nWill women be admitted?\n\nAttempts to have the membership rules changed to allow women to join have so far failed, despite claims that the ban gives men a professional networking advantage.\n\n“Over the past year there has been growing discontent among women working in the legal profession at the club’s continued refusal to reform,” reports The Guardian.\n\nMore than 300 lawyers have now signed a petition calling for the club to admit female members, with 115 QCs, 77 barristers, 65 solicitors and 37 partners and directors of law firms among the signatories. It is part of a campaign launched by lingerie mogul Emily Bendell after her application to join the club was rejected.\n\n“Women are allowed in as guests but cannot join the club’s ranks,” explains The Times.\n\nBendell has previously given her take on the rules: “Women are only able to access the club’s services as second-class citizens on the whim of a man, who has to both invite and pay for them.”\n\nAnd, in the petition for change, Cherie Blair wrote: “Forty-five years ago, I was left standing outside the Garrick while my supervisor took my fellow pupil Tony Blair inside. It’s outrageous that so little progress has been made since then.”\n\nIt is estimated that up to “25 per cent of the senior judiciary holds membership at the Garrick, plus dozens of QCs”, reports the Evening Standard, and many senior legal professionals have spoken out against the club’s policy over the years, including Baroness Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court.\n\nHale criticised the policy in 2015, expressing shock that “so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick” and suggested the club contributed to the “systemic barriers” preventing women from reaching the top judicial ranks.\n\nPrevious attempts to change the club’s “anachronistic policy” have failed, reports the paper. In 2015, 50.5% of Garrick members voted in favour of admitting women, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Kate Samuelson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/17"}]}

They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs. They’re asking us to stay true to what American stands for.”\n\nStanding on the soaring landscape in northwestern France, Biden is facing a steep climb of his own as he turns his attention from this week’s commemorations of D-Day to the two global conflicts that have consumed much of his presidency: the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip.\n\nBiden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris on Friday — a full day before he was scheduled to confer with French President Emmanuel Macron. He'll hold bilateral talks with Macron on Saturday, before he is feted by the French leader at a formal state dinner. Biden with see both allies again next week when he returns to Europe for the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit.\n\nTough conversations are ahead for Biden and the European nations that − along with Canada, the U.S., the UK and Japan − make up the G7, about how to bring about an end to the war between Israel and Hamas and how Gaza will be governed after the conflict. Two more European Union members and Norway recognized Palestine as a state at the end of May.\n\nG7 nations have not followed suit. They have, however, endorsed a three-phase peace proposal Biden laid out last week, which he said would pave the way for Palestinians to return to their homes.\n\nMore:As Joe Biden marks D-Day anniversary, he faces a world again embroiled in conflict\n\nBiden looks to G7 for help with Ukraine and Gaza\n\nBiden is also trying to urgently persuade G7 allies to unite around a plan to support Ukraine’s military operations and the reconstruction of the war-torn country’s critical infrastructure. The proposal involves leveraging the interest from an estimated $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a loan that could be used to pay for military aid and reconstruction aid. The loan could generate as much as $50 billion in additional revenue.\n\nThat money would supplement the $60 billion in aid the U.S. approved in late April, roughly half of which is allocated to military equipment and nearly $8 billion of which was set aside to pay for essential government services. The E.U. also approved roughly $54 billion in financial assistance for Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Ukraine’s Economic Recovery Penny Pritzker told USA TODAY in an interview prior to Biden's trip to France that the assistance packages plus the prospective loan would “show people that there's enough capital there that Ukraine will win this war…and that there's also capital to begin the rebuilding.\"\n\n\"You're seeing the US flooding the zone with more weapons and equipment, given our supplemental, but you're also seeing the rest of the democratic world stepping up,\" said Pritzker, who recently visited Ukraine.\n\nCongress gave the Biden administration the authority it needs to carry out the plan in the Ukraine aid legislation. But the White House has countered that it can't pull it off without G7 nations' help, because most of the money is held outside the U.S.\n\nThe topic will be at the top of Biden's agenda on Saturday when he meets with Macron. \"The clock is ticking down to the G7, and we’re going to make a big push to see if we can get clarity on a path forward over the course of the next several days,\" White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said this week. \"This is a priority for the United States. We believe it’s a priority for the entire G7. We want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilize resources for Ukraine at scale so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war,\" Sullivan said.\n\nUkraine Caucus co-chair Marcy Kaptur said lawmakers are hopeful G7 nations can find a way to move forward together. She described the Biden administration's interest plan as a \"down payment\" on the reconstruction of the eastern European nation.\n\nMore:Biden on D-Day anniversary and Normandy landings: 'Let us be worthy of their sacrifice'\n\n\"Let's work with our allies and find a way to do it. But I think that nations that choose not to — if they were to choose not to participate — that tells us a lot about those countries,\" Kaptur, D-Ohio, told USA TODAY. \"And so I think it'll be a test of mettle.\"\n\nBiden is hoping to have a deal in place by the time he sees his counterpart next week in Italy at the G7 summit.\n\nAt their meeting in France, he apologized to Zelenskky for the slow pace of Ukraine aid after a months-long battle with Republicans in Congress to get it approved. But he did not show up the meeting empty-handed: Biden said the U.S. would be sending $225 million for munitions − including air defenses that will aid in the protection of Ukraine's electric grid, which Russian forces have been heavily targeting.\n\n\"You continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, just remarkable. We’re not going to walk away from you,\" Biden said. \"I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass in terms of funding because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money in it.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is expected to see Zelenskyy next weekend at a Ukraine-backed peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nBiden sees parallel with WWII\n\nIn his remarks later on Friday in Normandy, Biden said the Rangers who scaled the cliffs above the English Channel on June 6, 1944, didn’t know they would change the world. But they did. “They did their duty,” he said. “They were a part of something greater than themselves.”\n\nDrawing parallels to current threats to democracy at home and abroad, he said it’s not enough just to honor the Rangers. Americans should follow their example.\n\nWhen Americans talk about democracy, they often speak in big ideas like life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness but seldom talk about how hard it is, Biden said.\n\n“American democracy asks the hardest of things: to believe that we’re a part of something bigger than ourselves,” he said. “So democracy begins with each of us.”\n\nHis remarks came on the third day of a five-day trip to France and just hours after he attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when from the United States and its allies landed on the beaches of Normandy to liberate France from the grip of Nazi Germany.\n\nPointe du Hoc, eight miles west of the American Normandy Cemetery, where more than 9,000 American soldiers killed in the war are buried, was the scene of a legendary feat of bravery during the D-Day landings.\n\nMore:'The Americans are landing': A grandmother's 80-year-old diary documents opening of D-Day\n\nDuring the 1944 invasion, Army Rangers using ladders made out of rope scaled the 100-foot cliffs and seized German artillery pieces that could have fired on troops landing at Omaha and Utah beaches. T\n\nThe Rangers, under the command of Lt. Col. James E. Rudder of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, endured German machine gunfire and hand grenades that rained down on them as they climbed. The Rangers suffered heavy casualties, with 77 killed and 152 wounded.\n\nHis warnings about current dangers to democracy have come amid signs that Americans have grow weary of wars in Europe and the Middle East. Ukraine is fighting for survival after its unprovoked invasion by Russia two years ago. Hamas has been at war with Israel in Gaza following the militant group’s surprise cross-border attack that killed 1,200 Israelis.\n\nMore:Russia opens new front in Ukraine war. Is Ukraine losing the war with Russia?\n\nBoth have been costly to Biden. He has had to battle Republicans in Congress to provide war assistance to Ukraine. His unyielding support for Israel has hurt him politically among members of the Democratic Party’s left wing, who have been angered by his refusal to demand an immediate cease fire and by the humanitarian toll that the war has wreaked on Gaza.\n\nIn the lead-up to the G7 summit, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who accompanied Biden to France, will also make a just-announced trip to the Middle East, including a stop in Israel. Blinken will push for Hamas to accept the ceasefire agreement that is on the table and for the release of all hostages, the State Department said.\n\nThe U.S. is still waiting for an official response from Hamas to the proposal, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday.\n\nBiden’s focus while in France has so far has been D-Day, but with the commemorations concluded, he will meet with Macron to discuss the wars in Ukraine and Israel and priorities such as the Indo-Pacific region, climate change and U.S.-French cooperation on security for the upcoming summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nLater on Saturday, Macron will host Biden and first lady Jill Biden for a state dinner. Macron was the first leader the Biden's threw a lavish bash for at the White House and the only European leader who Biden has honored with a state dinner during his term.\n\nMichael Collins and Francesca Chambers cover the White House.

During that process, Russia renewed its offensive to devastating effect, taking the eastern city of Avdiivka in February and making slow but consistent gains in the Donetsk region since then.\n\nThe first shipments are now arriving on the frontlines, but the prolonged wait will make reversing recent Russian gains even more of a challenge for Ukraine's beleaguered forces. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged that \"it's going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay\" in Congress.\n\nThe recent gains have come at a steep cost for Russia, too, said The New York Times. Casualty estimates circulating among military analysts, pro-Russian bloggers and Ukrainian officials suggest that Moscow \"lost more troops taking Avdiivka than it did in 10 years of fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s\". And the death tolls on both sides of the conflict are continuing to mount.\n\nHow many Russian and Ukrainian troops have died in the conflict?\n\nTrue casualty figures are \"notoriously difficult to pin down\", said Newsweek, and \"experts caution that both sides likely inflate the other's reported losses\".\n\nEarlier this month, an investigation by the BBC's Russian unit was able to identify 52,155 named Russian military personnel who have died in the conflict so far, but used statistical data on excess deaths to suggest that the true figure could be more than 100,000. Emmanuel Macron's foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, said France was working with an estimate of 150,000 Russian military deaths.\n\nIn February, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the invasion. No further official figures have been released since then, but The New York Times reported in May that the Ukrainian military was \"overloaded with casualties and unable to account for thousands\" of soldiers missing in action.\n\nWhat does victory look like for each side?\n\nBefore Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, Putin outlined the objectives of what he called a \"special military operation\". His goal, he claimed, was to \"denazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine, and to defend Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.\n\nAnother objective, although never explicitly stated, was to topple the Ukrainian government and remove the country's president, Zelenskyy. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Zelenskyy shortly after the invasion. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.\n\nRussia shifted its objectives, however, about a month into the invasion, after Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. According to the Kremlin, its main goal became the \"liberation of the Donbas\", including the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – but Moscow has made little progress in achieving this aim.\n\nUkraine's main objective is the liberation of its occupied territories. That includes not just those held by Russia since the February 2022 invasion, but a return to its internationally recognised borders, including Crimea.\n\nCan Ukraine win the war?\n\nAfter weeks of blistering aerial bombardments of Ukrainian positions, there's a \"great risk\" of the defensive lines \"collapsing wherever Russian generals decide to focus their offensive\", said Politico.\n\nA senior Ukrainian military source told the news site: \"There's nothing that can help Ukraine now because there are no serious technologies able to compensate Ukraine for the large mass of troops Russia is likely to hurl at us.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Zelenskyy lowered the age of military conscription in Ukraine to 25 in an attempt to boost troop numbers. But conscription remains a touchy topic in Ukraine, and officials have had to tread lightly amid dwindling enthusiasm for military service. \"We don't only have a military crisis – we have a political one,\" one of the officers speaking to Politico warned.\n\nUkraine's \"inherent weakness is that it depends on others for funding and arms\", wrote Bowen for the BBC, while Russia – in addition to an advantage in raw manpower – \"makes most of its own weapons\". And while the US continues to impose restrictions on how its weaponry is used in Ukraine, including a ban on strikes within Russia, Moscow \"is buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea\" with no such limitations.\n\nVladimir Putin is reported to be \"ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines\", said Reuters, an arrangement which would \"leave Russia in possession of substantial chunks of four Ukrainian regions\". But Zelenskyy has repeatedly emphasised that any peace deal must include the withdrawal of Russian forces to behind pre-invasion borders, meaning the prospect of any ceasefire or peace talks currently \"seems remote\".\n\nOn 15 and 16 June, representatives from more than 80 countries are to take part in a summit in Switzerland aimed at establishing a framework which could lead to lasting peace.\n\nHowever, Russia is not invited to the conference, making it \"more of a solidarity exercise than a true negotiation\", Sergey Radchenko, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told European news website Euractiv.\n\nAny serious ceasefire or peace deal will be a \"protracted negotiation between a very limited number of parties\", he said. \"At the moment what we are seeing is a tendency towards a short PR event with a large number of parties, except the ones that matter.\"", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia delegations to meet for talks Monday", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration.

During a news conference after an Oval Office meeting, Biden was explicit the project wouldn’t go forward if Russia invades Ukraine. It’s the stance he and US officials have taken for weeks, and has been a key point of discussion with the new Scholz government, according to senior administration officials.\n\nBut Scholz himself refused to even name the project during the news conference, and declined to commit to ending the pipeline if an invasion moves ahead – a stance causing problems for his foreign minister during a visit to Ukraine. In the interview with CNN, Scholz repeated his vow to remain aligned with the US, though again wouldn’t clarify his intentions for the Nord Stream project.\n\n“All the steps we will take we will do together,” Scholz told Tapper. “As the President said, we are preparing for that. You can understand and you can be absolutely sure that Germany will be together with all its allies and especially the United States, that we take the same steps. There will be no differences in that situation.”\n\nDuring the news conference, he had made a similar pledge.\n\n“I say to our American friends, we will be united. We will act together and we will take all the necessary steps and all the necessary steps will be done by all of us together,” he said, switching into English to make his point to a broader audience of American officials, Democrat and Republican alike, who have voiced concern at Germany’s willingness to confront Putin.\n\nThe Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which transmits Russian natural gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany, avoiding Ukraine, underscores Scholz’s predicament in confronting Russia for its aggressions in Europe. Germany is heavily dependent on Russian energy, making it difficult to impose severe punishment without risking a shut-off of oil and gas during the cold winter months.\n\nThe United States has been hurriedly searching the globe for alternative supplies of energy that could be diverted to Europe, from Asia to the Middle East to domestic American suppliers. It isn’t clear how successful the initiative has been, and some countries have said their gas supplies are already spoken for.\n\nThe United States opposes the pipeline and has stated clearly it won’t go forward should Putin decide to invade.\n\n“If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said Monday. “We will bring an end to it.”\n\nYet Scholz declined to specify what he is prepared to do to halt Nord Stream 2, saying only that Germany would undertake the same steps as the United States to punish Russia.\n\nPressed by a US reporter on whether that meant “pulling the plug” on Nord Stream, Scholz demurred again, appearing to roll his eyes slightly at the question.\n\n“As I said, we are acting together. We are absolutely united and we will not be taking different steps. We will do the same steps and they will be very, very hard to Russia and they should understand,” he said.\n\nPipeline politics anger Ukraine\n\nIt wasn’t the full-throated declaration that Nord Stream 2 would be halted some in the US had been looking for as a show of resolve against Russia. The debate over what Germany will do about the pipeline is also ruffling feathers in Ukraine, which opposes the project because it bypasses Ukrainian territory and transit fees.\n\nA meeting that had been scheduled for Monday between German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was canceled abruptly, officially due to a scheduling error.\n\nHowever, a source close to the Ukrainian government told Tapper the meeting didn’t take place because of Germany’s reluctance to abandon the Nord Stream 2 project should a Russian invasion proceed. The source also cited Germany’s refusal to provide lethal military assistance as a reason for the scrapped meeting.\n\nA spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded Tuesday morning on Twitter. “Claims that President @ZelenskyyUa didn’t meet with FM @ABaerbock in order to send a political message are divorced from reality,” Oleg Nikolenko wrote. “We won’t allow anyone to undermine (Ukraine-Germany) partnership.” CNN stands by its reporting.\n\nScholz, in the interview, said he didn’t know if the meeting had been changed because of Germany’s stance on the pipeline. He noted Baerbock was still in Ukraine, where she met instead with the foreign minister, and that he’d sent her there to go to the front lines and examine the situation.\n\n‘No need to win back trust’\n\nFor Biden’s part, he brushed off the notion that Germany could “win back trust” by publicly committing in more explicit terms to ending the Nord Stream project should Russia move ahead with an invasion.\n\n“There is no need to win back trust. He has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany’s partnership with the United States. None,” he said.\n\nPrivately, Biden has made clear he believes the Nord Stream 2 issue should not get in the way of improving ties with Germany and recognizes the delicate politics Scholz is facing with the project. His comments at Monday’s news conference suggested an understanding between the two men about the pipeline, which is not yet operable at it undergoes environmental reviews.\n\nBut even Biden refused to say how the US would stop Nord Stream, as he promised to do should Russia invade Ukraine, without Germany’s help.\n\n“I promise you, we will be able to do it,” he said.\n\nScholz has resisted sending lethal aid to Ukraine and won’t spell out in much detail his plans to issue sanctions should Russian troops cross the border in an invasion. But in a chummy joint appearance at the White House, both men said fears among US officials that Germany was hiding from a leadership role were misplaced.\n\n“Germany’s completely reliable. Completely, totally, thoroughly reliable. I have no doubt about Germany at all,” Biden said during a joint news conference, bucking up his visitor during his first official visit to Washington.\n\nScholz took office in December, succeeding a towering figure in global politics – Angela Merkel – whose absence during the current crisis is being felt on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHe arrived at the White House as Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons on Ukraine’s borders he would need for a full-scale invasion of the country, based on US intelligence estimates – though no one seems to know what his true intentions might be.\n\n“I don’t know that he knows what he’s going to do,” Biden said Monday.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, Biden was eager to demonstrate western unity against Putin’s aggression.\n\n“There’s no need to win back trust. (Scholz) has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany’s partnership with the United States, none,” Biden said.\n\nAhead of the President’s meeting with Scholz, US officials said the two leaders would spend most of their time together discussing the Ukraine matter, including a “robust sanctions package” being prepared to punish Moscow should an invasion go ahead.\n\nWhen they sat down in the Oval Office in front of a roaring fireplace, Biden said the US and Germany were “working in lockstep” to deter Russian aggression.\n\nThe dire facts on the ground lent Monday’s meeting in the Oval Office the air of crisis talks, though Biden also hoped to use the session to get to know Scholz personally, given they are likely to spend a lot more time together in the years to come. They had met once before, when Merkel brought Scholz along to October’s Group of 20 summit, but never as equals. Biden has sought to repair ties to Germany after former President Donald Trump publicly accused the country of shirking its international obligations.\n\nUS officials frustrated\n\nThe impression that Germany is unwilling – or, because of its energy dependence on Russia, unable – to offer serious deterrence measures has left some US officials frustrated.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic members of Congress have voiced their displeasure, and even Biden has hinted at the discord, saying last month a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine would prompt some disagreement among NATO members over how to respond.\n\nScholz, meanwhile, has faced the awkward association of a predecessor from his political party establishing close ties to the Russian energy industry. Gerhard Schroeder, the last Social Democratic Party politician to serve as chancellor, serves on the board of directors for Nord Stream 2. And last week, Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom announced Schroeder had been nominated to its board, as well.\n\n“He’s not speaking for the government. He’s not working for the government. He’s not the government. I am the chancellor now,” Scholz said on CNN, responding to the questions about Schroeder.\n\nThere has only been one other chancellor since Schroeder left office in 2005: Merkel, whose absence from the world stage after her 16-year tenure has been felt acutely, particularly as Putin tests the West’s resolve.\n\nWhen Russia last invaded Ukraine, in 2014, Merkel played a central role as a go-between for Putin and Germany’s western allies. She spoke with him consistently and encouraged other leaders to step up their sanctions to punish Moscow for annexing Crimea. She also played a central role keeping Washington updated through the close relationship she’d cultivated with then-President Barack Obama.\n\nThis time, it is not the German leader who is emerging in that role but the French. President Emmanuel Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening. Macron visited Moscow on Monday and is expected in Kyiv later this week.\n\nScholz hasn’t taken as visible a role in defusing the latest crisis, earning him criticism from Germans who accuse the chancellor of making himself invisible at a moment of strain. In an apparent attempt to dissuade that impression, Scholz, too, will visit Russia and Ukraine later this month.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-amanpour-munich-security-conference-intl/index.html", "title": "Zelensky: Make potential sanctions on Russia public, before a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday sanctions on Russia should be made public before a possible invasion of Ukraine occurs, as tensions between western nations and Russia continue to intensify.\n\nZelensky told CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in a one-on-one interview at the Munich Security Conference that he disagreed with the stance that sanctions should only be listed after a potential Russian invasion takes place.\n\n“The question of just making it public … just the list of sanctions, for them, for us, to know what will happen if they start the war – even that question does not have the support,” he told CNN.\n\n“We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders, or after we will have no economy … why would we need those sanctions then?”\n\n“We had a discussion some time ago with one of the leaders of one of the leading countries and we were talking about the sanctions policy … we had a different vision on how sanctions should applied when Russian aggression will happen,” Zelensky said. “So when you are asking, what can be done, well, lots of different things can be done. We can even provide you with a list. The most important is willingness.\n\n“If you can’t even disclose what will happen to whom if the war starts … I doubt it will be triggered after it happens,” he added.\n\nThe security conference is taking place as the brewing conflict between Russia and Ukraine threatens to boil over and diplomatic efforts stall.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive satellite images show Putin's latest moves. Expert breaks down what they tell us 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nRussia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of troops, equipment and artillery on the country’s doorstep. The aggression has sparked warnings from US officials that a Russian invasion is imminent.\n\nWhen asked about a potential false flag pretext for war with Russia, Zelensky told Amanpour that “any provocations are very dangerous.”\n\n“I think the most complicated question is that in Crimea, in the temporary occupied territory of the Donbas along Ukraine and Russia, there is 30 to 35,000 on the temporary occupying territories … so provocations are, indeed, very dangerous, if you have this number of troops. One shelling, one cannon fire can lead to war,” Zelensky warned.\n\n“This is what our partners believe, I mean the partners that are around us that have joined borders with us. We know the history of the Soviet Union and they do understand the kind of risks we are facing. Poland, the Baltic states, Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia, Moldova – they know what that could lead to. So, we need to be very careful,” he continued.\n\nHe went on to say casualties between Ukraine and Russia were more significant in 2014 but admitted that current tensions are “horrible” and “a tragedy for our nation, for our people.”\n\n“This is the tragedy for Russians as well who used to have good relations with Ukraine,” he added.\n\nThe Ukrainian President told CNN that NATO partners needed to clarify a timeline on which the country could join the military alliance.\n\n“Ukraine needs security guarantees,” Zelensky said. “We are smart people, we are not narrow minded. We understand there are lots of different risks because of NATO, there is no consensus around other allies, everyone is saying there is some distance that we need to go between Ukraine and NATO that we need to walk. All we are saying is tell us how much time does it take to complete this distance?”\n\nIn earlier remarks to the conference, Zelensky posed a question asking why Ukraine had not been permitted to join NATO. “We are told the doors are open.. but the strangers are still not allowed,” he said.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO – in terms of weaponry, training and personnel – as a threat to its own security. Putin has also called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia’s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nAmanpour also asked Zelensky about the aggressive use of US intelligence to dissuade Putin from invading Ukraine. He said he was “grateful for the work that both of our intelligence has been doing. But the intelligence I trust is my intelligence.\n\n“I trust Ukrainian intelligence who … understand what’s going on along our borders, who have different intelligence sources and understand different risk based on intercepted data… this information should be used.”\n\nHe continued: “We are not really living in delusion. We understand what can happen tomorrow … just putting ourselves in coffins and waiting for foreign soldiers to come in is not something we are prepared to do.”\n\nZelensky then called for international partners to support Ukraine by investing in the country. “Strengthen our arms… our economy. Invest in our country. Bring your business in.\n\n“We are not panicking, we want to live our lives,” he added.\n\nZelensky also explained that his attendance at the conference on Saturday was to ensure there was a Ukrainian voice was in the room. “I’m the president, it’s important for all our partners and friends to not agree about anything behind our back,” he said. “We’re not panicking, we’re very consistent that we are not responding to any provocations.”\n\nHis appearance in Germany had been under intense scrutiny after it was revealed that Biden administration officials had privately urged the Ukrainian leader to remain at home amid concerns of a possible Russian incursion, according to three US officials and one senior Ukrainian official.\n\nSome US officials were concerned that Zelensky’s absence from Ukraine could open the door for Russia to make false claims that he has fled.\n\nHowever, the president’s office confirmed earlier Saturday he would attend the conference and meet US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before returning to Kyiv later the same day.\n\nHours before the sit-down with Amanpour, Zelensky met with Harris, telling her he was grateful for US support, particularly in bolstering Ukraine’s defense capacity.\n\n“This is our land and the only thing we want is to have peace, bring the peace back to our country,” Zelensky said.\n\nIn the bilateral meeting which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Harris told the Ukrainian leader that the US “takes seriously the importance of the integrity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine and your sovereignty, and the United States stands with Ukraine in this regard.”\n\n“Any threats to your country we take seriously, and we have rallied our allies and our partners to speak with one voice,” the vice president said.\n\nHarris said she wanted to hear directly from Zelensky about his concerns and the developing situation on the ground and would share with him information the US has about the current crisis.\n\n“As you know, this is a decisive moment in our world history,” Harris told Zelensky.", "authors": ["Emmet Lyons Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Emmet Lyons", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/07/weekend-news-roundup/28648033/", "title": "Biggest news you missed this weekend", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAmerican Pharoah wins Triple Crown in stunning style\n\nOn Saturday afternoon in New York, 90,000 fans shook Belmont's venerable grandstand as American Pharoah spun off the final turn like he was shot out of a sling, running away from Frosted and into the history books.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:The enigma of Vladimir Putin: What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way. We need to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity by considering other human beings as brothers and sisters,\" the spiritual leader said on his website. \"This is how we will build a more peaceful world.\"\n\nThe Nobel peace prize winner also said any problems and disagreements are best resolved through dialogue. \"Genuine peace comes about through mutual understanding and respect for each other's well-being,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he hopes peace is swiftly restored.\n\n\"We must not lose hope,\" he said. \"The 20th century was a century of war and bloodshed.

It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nMore:Ukraine athletes defend country, demand sanctions for Russia\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ukraine: departing the country may take up to 30 hours\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is now urging U.S citizens in Ukraine to try leaving using private transportation options as leaving could in some cases take more than 30 hours.\n\nThe embassy said Sunday “conditions may deteriorate” in various parts of the country without any warning due to the escalating Russian invasion.\n\n“Careful consideration should be made to routes and the risks of travel because Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations have been destroyed. Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nMore:Satellite images show damaged airport in Hostomel following strikes\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal.

Here's a list by country\n\nUS official: Belarus may join Ukraine invasion\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official says Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces that invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nBelarus has been providing support for Russia’s war effort but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.\n\nThe American official has direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments and says the decision by Belarus’ leader on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine happening in the coming days. The official spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nRussian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:There may be risk, but the U.S. will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nRussia rendering Facebook unusable in some places\n\nRussia has apparently rendered Facebook largely unusable across leading Russian telecommunications providers amid rising friction between Moscow and the social media platform.\n\nThe London-based internet monitor NetBlocks reports that Facebook’s network of content-distribution servers in Russia was so badly restricted Sunday that “content no longer loads, or loads extremely slowly making the platforms unusable.”\n\nRussian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor on Friday announced plans to “partially restrict” access to Facebook. That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:There may be risk, but the US will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them.

They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials.

The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities.

In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war.

So far, punishing Western sanctions haven’t stopped Putin, and it’s unclear whether the new steps expected this week – including sanctions on hundreds of members of Russia’s lower legislative body and changes to NATO’s force posture along its eastern edge – will be different.\n\nYet as he departed the White House early Wednesday, Biden appeared intent on using his last-minute wartime visit to Europe to send a message. Asked what he’d say to his partners, Biden said he’d wait to deliver it face to face.\n\n“All I have to say, I’m going to say it when I get there,” he said before boarding a seven-hour flight to Belgium.\n\nEmergency summits of NATO, the European Union and the G7 will focus on displays of cooperation in punishing Russia and providing support to Ukraine as it comes under fire. A stop afterward in Poland is meant to highlight the massive refugee crisis that’s followed Russia’s invasion as well as to reassure allies on NATO’s eastern edge.\n\nFor Biden, the last-minute talks are a venue to demonstrate the foreign policy credentials he promised as a candidate, when he vowed to restore American leadership and repair broken alliances. The war in Ukraine is widely viewed inside the White House as one of the defining challenges for Biden and his presidential legacy. An emotional challenge from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, issued last week during his virtual address to Congress, now hangs over Biden’s entire trip: “Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace.”\n\nThe White House has ruled out Biden visiting Ukraine itself after leaders there said it would make for a powerful symbol amid the war. Instead, he will issue his most direct efforts at Western unity during the war so far, rallying his counterparts at a critical juncture for the crisis.\n\nMilitary officials say Russia’s weeks-old invasion has reached a stalemate, leading to fears over how Putin will proceed. Among the topics for leaders to discuss this week is how to respond should the Russian President decide to use nuclear or chemical weapons or launch a massive cyberattack.\n\nAsked as he was leaving the White House about the risk of chemical warfare, Biden said he felt it was “a real threat.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Biden said Putin’s stumbles in Ukraine would cause him to resort to more troubling options, with cyber attacks being his primary concern.\n\n“Now Putin’s back is against the wall. He wasn’t anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,” Biden warned during remarks to business leaders before departing Washington.\n\nBiden looks to spur allies to further action against Russia\n\nBiden hopes to emerge from an intensive day of meetings Thursday with some new actions to announce alongside his partners: fresh sanctions on Russia, steps to cut off its oil and gas profits, or new announcements of military or financial assistance to Ukraine.\n\nHe plans to put sanctions this week on hundreds of Russians serving in the country’s lower legislative body, an official familiar with the announcement said, setting off what are expected to be many new steps to punish Russia for its war in Ukraine. The US had already sanctioned some members of the body, but this week’s announcement will expand the list.\n\nAhead of Biden’s trip to Brussels, the Pentagon provided the White House with a series of options for potential additional US troops in eastern Europe, according to a US official. Biden could announce changes to the force posture following his meetings Thursday, though any announcement would depend on conversations with allies and is not finalized.\n\nUS Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Wednesday that NATO leaders would approve at the summit the deployment of four additional battle groups in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia. Speaking at an Atlantic Council event, Smith said the battle groups were “not just national forces” and said additional details would be shared on Thursday. She added that NATO is in discussions about its medium- and long-term force presence in its eastern flank.\n\n“We’re going to have to make a series of ongoing assessment about our force posture that will take us weeks and months into the future,” she said, noting that “it’s still an open question” of how the alliance takes the NATO-Russia Founding Act – which NATO allies believe Russia is “in clear violation of” – and moves to its longer-term posture.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said a day ahead of Biden’s departure that the President would make a slew of new announcements, including “a joint action on enhancing European energy security and reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas at long last,” as well as “longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture on the eastern flank.”\n\nBiden will also make further commitments on human rights “to respond to the growing flow of refugees” from Ukraine.\n\nAnd Sullivan said a new package of sanctions would be unveiled Thursday “in conjunction with our allies.”\n\n“One of the key elements of that announcement will focus not just on adding new sanctions, but on ensuring that there is a joint effort to crack down on evasion, on sanctions busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, weaken or get around the sanctions,” he said, calling that “an important part of this next phase.”\n\nBut Western leaders are quickly confronting the limits of what they can do to counter Putin.\n\nBiden and his Western allies have largely ruled out using their own forces in Ukraine, wary of entering the conflict directly. They have rebuffed calls from Zelensky to establish a no-fly-zone or provide fighter jets.\n\nEven a Polish proposal to establish an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine, which Warsaw is expected to raise during Thursday’s meeting, has been met with skepticism from US officials, who say Biden is opposed to any scenario that would pit American troops directly against Russians.\n\nStill, there remain some items for leaders to adopt. White House and European officials have spent the past week in intensive discussions to develop a menu of options, and Biden discussed the summit with his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy on Monday.\n\n“They can do a couple of things. One, they can turn on the spigot. The weapons are flowing. But the spigot can be bigger. It can be wider open. There can be more going in there,” said William Taylor, a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n“All the kinds of things we talk about in terms of anti-air, air defense, anti-armor, the Stingers, all those can go in. That aperture needs to be wider. That’s number one. Number two, tighten the noose. There are still sanctions that are not in place yet.”\n\nThat includes expanding the list of Russian banks cut off from the SWIFT international banking system, imposing sanctions on more Russian oligarchs or politicians, or taking further steps to cut off Russia’s energy profits.\n\nBiden announced earlier this month that the US would ban imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal, though those products represented only a small portion of American energy use. Far more impactful would be a European move in the same direction.\n\nThe White House has been working with other major oil- and gas-producing countries to divert supplies to Europe, and the European Union announced steps in conjunction with Biden to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. The topic is expected to arise in conversation at this week’s summits in Brussels.\n\nBiden unlikely to visit Zelensky as diplomacy ramps up\n\nMore perplexing for the leaders gathering in Brussels this week could be the halting attempts at diplomacy between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, which are viewed skeptically by many in Washington and Europe.\n\nZelensky has recently indicated he is willing to consider some concessions to Russia to help bring an end to the violence, including a neutrality policy – albeit one underpinned by robust security guarantees – raising more questions about the state of talks and specific elements of any peace deal that may be under consideration.\n\nNATO leaders have been discussing whether and how Zelensky should participate in this week’s summit. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, which has allowed the US and other members to set limits on how far they are willing to go in defending it. Yet Zelensky has proved a powerful international voice and leaders are mindful of his response to their decisions.\n\nSince last month, Zelensky has been asking Biden to visit Kyiv, suggesting it would make for a dramatic show of support. But the option was never explored at the White House.\n\n“Any president of the United States traveling into a war zone requires not only security considerations but also an enormous amount of resources on the ground, which is always a factor for us as we make considerations,” press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. “It was a decision made about what would be most effective on the trip.”\n\nUkrainian officials said Biden could show his support in other ways.\n\n“We wish him to come to Ukraine, but unfortunately that’s not the case this time,” Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky’s office and his chief diplomatic adviser, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour this week.\n\n“We are thankful to the US President for the level of resistance he’s now rendering. Really – this is a clear sign of support, not only politically and by words, but in terms of military equipment, in terms of weapons and ammunition, in terms of sanctions.”\n\nStill, Zhovkva said leaders at this week’s summit could make even more efforts at getting Ukraine what it needs to sustain the battle against Russia, including anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems and fighter jets. And he said Biden’s example would matter most as the world looks to him for leadership.\n\n“This is where the political position, the political will of the US matters,” Zhovkva said. “We do know which countries do possess this weapon. Sometimes they look at the US, they look at the position, they start to play pingpong. Again, the will and courage of US President is what matters now.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/14/europe/sweden-finland-nato-next-steps-intl/index.html", "title": "Finland and Sweden want to join NATO. Here's how it works and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFinland and Sweden are poised to end decades of neutrality by joining NATO, a dramatic evolution in European security and geopolitics sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe two Nordic nations had long kept the military alliance at an arm’s length, even while eying Russia to their east with caution.\n\nBut Moscow’s assault on Ukraine has sparked renewed security concern across the region, and the leaders of each country have signaled their desire to join the bloc after more than 75 years of military non-alignment.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about how the war in Ukraine caused the shift, and what comes next.\n\nWhat’s happened so far?\n\nFinnish leaders announced their intentions to join NATO on Thursday, and formally presented that desire at a press conference on Sunday.\n\nSweden’s Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson followed suit on Monday, confirming her government had decided to begin the process of seeking NATO membership.\n\nFinland’s move to seek to join the alliance requires a vote in parliament, but given the support of the ruling government, that hurdle is expected to be passed comfortably. In Sweden, the move was debated in parliament on Monday and there is broad support for joining NATO, but the government does not need parliamentary consent to move ahead.\n\n“When we look at Russia, we see a very different kind of Russia today than we saw just a few months ago,” Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Sunday. “Everything has changed when Russia attacked Ukraine. And I personally think that we cannot trust anymore there will be a peaceful future next to Russia.”\n\nJoining NATO is “an act of peace [so] that there will never again be war in Finland in the future,” Marin said.\n\nHer Swedish counterpart, Andersson, said Monday: “To ensure the safety of Swedish people, the best way forward is to join NATO together with Finland.”\n\nWhen asked when exactly the country will hand in the application, she said it could it happen either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday this week, adding that it needs to be done in coordination with Finland.\n\nThe announcements were met with support from leaders in almost all NATO nations. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters “the United States would strongly support the NATO application by either Sweden or Finland should they choose to formally apply to the alliance. We will respect whatever decision they make.”\n\nFinland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin and its President Sauli Niinistö announced their decision to join NATO on Sunday. Heikki Saukkomaa/Lehtikuva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nNATO has what it calls an “open door policy” on new members – any European country can request to join, so long as they meet certain criteria and all existing members agree.\n\nA country does not technically “apply” to join; Article 10 of its founding treaty states that, once a nation has expressed interest, the existing member states “may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty … to accede.”\n\nNATO diplomats told Reuters that ratification of new members could take a year, as the legislatures of all 30 current members must approve new applicants.\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden already meet many of the requirements for membership, which include having a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; treating minority populations fairly; committing to resolve conflicts peacefully; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and committing to democratic civil-military relations and institutions.\n\nThe process may not be without hurdles; Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he was not looking at both countries joining NATO “positively,” accusing them of housing Kurdish “terrorist organizations.”\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinistö told CNN he was “confused” by those comments on Sunday, claiming Erdogan had been far more receptive to the idea in a telephone conversation between the two leaders a month ago.\n\n“I think that what we need now is a very clear answer. I’m prepared to have a new discussion with President Erdogan about the problems he has raised,” Niinistö said.\n\nBut NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attempted to allay concerns about Turkey’s stance, saying Sunday the country “has made it clear that their intention is not to block membership.” Blinken also said Sunday he was “very confident that we will reach consensus.”\n\nIn the meantime, both countries will have to rely on its current allies and partners for security guarantees, rather than Article 5 – the clause which states an attack against one NATO nation is an attack against all, and which triggers a collective response in that event.\n\nSweden and Finland have received assurances of support from the United States and Germany should they come under attack, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed mutual security agreements with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts last week.\n\nWhat does NATO membership entail?\n\nThe reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one an attack against all.\n\nArticle 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since NATO was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe point of the treaty, and Article 5 specifically, was to deter the Soviets from attacking liberal democracies that lacked military strength. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance – including the massive US military – can be used to protect any single member nation, such as smaller countries who would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army.\n\nFormer Swedish leader Carl Bildt told CNN he doesn’t see new big military bases being built in either country should they join NATO. He said that joining the alliance would likely mean more joint military training and planning between Finland, Sweden and NATO’s 30 current members. Swedish and Finnish forces could also participate in other NATO operations around the globe, such as those in the Baltic states, where several bases have multinational troops.\n\n“There’s going to be preparations for contingencies as part of deterring any adventures that the Russians might be thinking of,” Bildt said. “The actual change is going to be fairly limited.”\n\nWhy haven’t Finland and Sweden already joined NATO?\n\nWhile other Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark and Iceland were original members of the alliance, Sweden and Finland did not join the pact for historic and geopolitical reasons.\n\nBoth Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution, and Sweden adopted neutral foreign policy stances during the Cold War, refusing to align with the Soviet Union or the United States.\n\nSweden’s policy of neutrality goes back to the early 1800s, when the country steadfastly stayed out of European conflicts. Its King Gustav XIV formally adopted that neutral status in 1834, according to NATO, and Sweden declared a policy of “non-belligerency” during World War II – allowing Nazi troops to pass through its land into Finland, while also accepting Jewish refugees.\n\nSweden opted to maintain its neutral status after the war ended.\n\nFinland’s neutrality has historically proved more difficult, as it shared a massive border with an authoritarian superpower.\n\nA Finno-Soviet treaty known as the Agreement of Friendship, signed in 1948 and extended on occasion through the decades, prohibited Finland from joining any military alliance considered hostile to the USSR, or from allowing a Western attack through Finnish territory.\n\nTo keep the peace, Finns adopted a process some call “Finlandization,” in which leaders acceded to Soviet demands from time to time. The term was coined during the Cold War and has been applied to other countries in which a superpower exerts control over smaller neighboring states.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Fmr. Finnish PM: 'Finlandization' not an answer for Ukraine 10:01 - Source: CNN\n\nBoth countries’ balancing acts effectively ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union together in 1995 and gradually aligned their defense policies with the West, while still avoiding joining NATO outright.\n\nEach country had different reasons for avoiding signing up for NATO pact in tandem with the EU.\n\nFor Finland, it was more geopolitical. The threat for Russia is more tangible thanks to the two countries’ shared 830-mile border.\n\n“Finland has been the exposed country, and we’ve been the protected country,” Bildt told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in a joint interview alongside former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb.\n\nWhile an independent nation, Sweden’s geography puts it in the same “strategic environment” as its liberal democratic neighbors, Bildt said. Finland and Sweden have enjoyed a close partnership for decades, with Stockholm viewing its decision to refrain from joining NATO as a way to help keep the heat off Helsinki. Now, however, Sweden is likely to follow Finland’s lead.\n\n“We share the idea that close cooperation will benefit both of us,” current Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a news conference last month alongside her Finnish counterpart Marin.\n\nHow Russia’s invasion changed everything\n\nSweden and Finland have been inching towards the West on security issues since joining the EU in 1995, shortly after the end of the Cold War. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically accelerated that process, pushing Sweden and Finland to pull the trigger on NATO membership.\n\nIf the Kremlin was willing to invade Ukraine – a country with 44 million people, a GDP of about $516 million, and an armed forces of 200,000 active troops – what would stop Putin from invading smaller countries like Finland in Sweden?\n\n“Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,” Finnish premier Marin said in April. “People’s mindset in Finland, also in Sweden changed and shifted very dramatically.”\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, public support for joining NATO in Finland has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The majority of Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there.\n\n“Our NATO membership was decided on the 24th of February, at 5 o’clock in the morning, when Putin and Russia attacked Ukraine” former Finnish leader Stubb told CNN. “Finland and Sweden would not have joined without this attack.”\n\nOfficials in both Sweden and Finland have also expressed frustration that, in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine, Russia attempted to demand security guarantees from NATO that the alliance stop expanding eastward. Such a concession, however, would have effectively given Russia the power to dictate the foreign policies of its neighbors by taking away their ability to choose their own allies and partners.\n\nRussia, Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist told CNN, wants “real influence in the security choices in Europe.”\n\n“They want an influence over the countries in the neighborhood. And that is totally unacceptable for Sweden.”\n\nAll NATO members must agree to adopt a new nation. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow has Russia reacted?\n\nRussia lambasted the decision by Finland and Sweden. Its deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Monday that the move would be a “mistake” with “far-reaching consequences,” according to state news agency TASS.\n\nThat followed similar threats from high-ranking Moscow officials. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure” after the announcement. He added that Russia’s reaction would depend on “how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move.”\n\nRussia currently shares about 755 miles of land border with five NATO members, according to the alliance. Finland’s accession would mean that a nation with which Russia shares an 830-mile border would become formally militarily aligned with the United States.\n\nThe addition of Finland and Sweden would also benefit the alliance, which would frustrate Russia. Both are serious military powers, despite their small populations.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that “Russia has no problems with these states,” adding that the expansion of NATO “does not pose a direct threat to Russia.”\n\n“But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response,” he added at the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Moscow. “We will see what it will be based on the threats that will be created for us.”\n\nHowever, Bildt and Stubb, the former Swedish and Finnish premiers, believe that so far, Russia’s response has been relatively muted.\n\n“The Kremlin sees Finnish and Swedish NATO membership as a Nordic solution, and in that sense, not a radical threat,” said Stubb. “We’re not too worried.”\n\nStubb and Bildt said they believe Moscow ultimately sees the two countries as reliable neighbors, despite their decision to join a Washington-backed alliance.\n\n“The fact that Finland and Sweden are part of the West doesn’t come as a surprise,” said Bildt.\n\nWhy does Russia loathe NATO?\n\nPutin sees the alliance as a bulwark aimed at Russia, despite the fact that it had spent much of the post-Soviet years focusing on issues like terrorism and peacekeeping.\n\nBefore Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance.\n\nUkraine’s desire to join NATO, and its status as a NATO partner – seen as a step on the way to eventual full membership – was one of the numerous grievances Putin cited in an attempt to justify his country’s invasion of its neighbor.\n\nThe irony is that the war in Ukraine has, effectively, given NATO a new purpose.\n\n“Article 5 is back in the game, and people understand that we need NATO because of a potential Russian threat,” Stubb said in an interview with CNN before the invasion.\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Sweden’s government does not need parliament’s consent to pursue membership in NATO.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden turns 80 years old on Sunday, becoming the first octogenarian to ever serve in the highest office of the United States.\n\nThe unique milestone of Biden’s birthday comes as the president faces speculation about whether he will mount a reelection run and dredges up questions about whether he’s too old to serve another term.\n\nThe president celebrated his birthday in Washington with a brunch hosted by first lady Jill Biden, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Jill Biden tweeted a photo of him blowing out a candle on top of a coconut cake, with balloons in the background.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\n“A perfect birthday celebration filled with so much love – and Joe’s favorite coconut cake!” she wrote.\n\nMembers of Biden’s family already in town celebrating his granddaughter’s wedding at the White House on Saturday attended the brunch.\n\nThe wedding’s timing, two people familiar with the planning had told CNN, was not a coincidence – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\nThe president has political momentum on his side ahead of a potential reelection bid – having been able to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate and thwart the historical political tides of a resounding Republican wave in Congress. There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Nancy Pelosi, 82, recently announced plans to step down as House speaker, celebrating Democrats ushering in a new generation of leadership. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 80, faced his first challenger to lead the Republican conference in 15 years – though that challenge was unsuccessful.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}]}

(Too bad it couldn’t be “Hit Man,” which moved to Netflix in the blink of an eye.)\n\nIn 2023, of course, there was the Barbenheimer phenomenon, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” pushing each other to greater heights. That they were both really good movies was nice, since there’s no real correlation between popularity and quality. That kind of success, in terms of ticket sales and cultural impact, will be hard to repeat, but you never know.\n\nWhat is a summer movie, anyway?\n\nWhat is a summer movie, anyway?

It’s more about setting a mood, particularly when you’re younger and summer is a time to reset, take some time off, take a vacation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe greatest of all time is without question “Jaws,” which was the first true summer blockbuster, setting the tone for all that followed. Unless it’s “Star Wars: Episode IV — a New Hope,” though it was just plain ol’ “Star Wars” back then. Or could it be “Mad Max: Fury Road?” “Raiders of the Lost Ark?” Your mileage may vary, but all of these say “summer” in some way.\n\nWhat to watch nextSign up to receive USA TODAY's Watch Party newsletter right to your inbox.\n\nGreatest summer of movies ever\n\nWhat seems inarguable, however, is that 1982 was the best summer for movies, ever. Here’s just a sampling of what came out that year: “Blade Runner,” “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “Tron,” “Night Shift,” “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan” and John Carpenter’s version of “The Thing.”\n\nPretty great, huh? But wait, there’s more. That summer kicked off with a one-two punch that was the original Barbenheimer, priming the pump for one of the most-entertaining couple of months of moviegoing, ever. (Of course, it didn’t hurt if you were young and unencumbered and your summer job consisted of painting gas meters for the local utility company. Not exactly a high-pressure gig.)\n\nOn June 7, “Poltergeist” came out. You can argue about how heavy a hand Steven Spielberg had in making it all you want (Tobe Hooper is the official director), but who cares? What counts is what you see on the screen — a ridiculously entertaining horror movie that is almost certainly scarier than you remember. It had a creepy trailer (“They’re heeerrre”) and, in a time when pop culture wasn’t so fragmented, it was what people were talking about. That’s the perfect summer-movie recipe.\n\nAlmost.\n\nBecause on June 11, just four days later, it got even better. That’s when “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial” came out. The movie was huge, eventually becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time (though it would be surpassed by Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” in 1993, and then any number of “Avatar” and Marvel movies). And it was everywhere. The little alien himself was on the cover of Rolling Stone, reading an issue of Variety that has the headline “The spaceman that saved Hollywood.”\n\n'E.T.' is Steven Spielberg's best movie\n\nIt’s also Spielberg’s best movie, no matter the season, the perfect marriage of all of his filmmaking strengths. It even plays to what are sometimes his weaknesses, namely his tendency to turn everything into a sentimental story about trying to heal broken families. In this case, a film about the ultimate outsider who comes into the life of a little boy whose parents are divorced, that sensibility is essential.\n\nDisagree on Spielberg's best movie?So does our critic Brian Truitt. See how he ranks all of Spielberg's movies\n\nTo trot out a cliché, it spoke to people. It certainly spoke to me. I don’t remember how many times I saw it, but at least one of those times was with my mother. Toward the end of the movie, as E.T. is getting ready to be transported back to wherever he came from, he and Elliot are preparing for the inevitable. Naturally, they’re sad, after all they’ve been through, to part. At one point E.T. says, “Be good.”\n\nThe first time I saw it, I gasped. My dad had died about six months before. Those were his last words. They struck me as small but momentous at the time, and this seemed to confirm their wisdom. I wondered how my mother would take it. To say she was not sentimental is an understatement — the church organist, she used to play Elton John’s “Funeral for a Friend” at actual funerals, the mourners unaware.\n\nShe thought the line was great. Because it was great. Because the movie was great. That summer was great, and the “Poltergeist”-“E.T.” combo was a big part of that. That’s what you want in a summer movie — entertaining in the moment, but a key to memories you’ll never forget.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2022/06/03/tom-cruises-latest-mission-restoring-summer-blockbuster-season-top-gun-maverick/9949792002/", "title": "Tom Cruise's latest mission: Restoring the summer blockbuster ...", "text": "Gotta hand it to Tom Cruise: the man understands value.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” his new and long-awaited sequel to the 1986 blockbuster that launched Cruise even higher into the stratosphere, was slated to be released in the summer of 2020. Well, we all know what happened there: the COVID-19 pandemic came along and shut down movie theaters all across the land.\n\nThat’s when Hollywood’s model for releasing films changed, perhaps for good. Audiences no longer needed to wait for lots of movies to come soon to a theater near them. Instead, they could just stream them on their mega-sized flat-screen TVs at home.\n\nThat was a thrill at first and often still is. At home in March of 2020, my wife Valerie and I watched a basketball film starring Ben Affleck that had just been released in theaters a mere three weeks earlier. As someone who remembers the pre-VCR days of waiting for big movies to finally play at the second-run theater in my neighborhood, this felt like a whole new world – a rare silver lining to the pandemic, though not anything to ease the fears that theaters were facing a virus-inflicted, existential threat.\n\nMore:Val Kilmer on the Tom Cruise 'Top Gun: Maverick' reunion, that final hug: 'Straight from the heart'\n\nAnyway. If memory serves, “Top Gun: Maverick” got postponed twice more as the health crisis persisted. Rather than release the film on Paramount’s streaming service, either exclusively or in conjunction with a limited theatrical release, the studio – or, let’s face it, Tom Cruise, most likely – insisted on holding back the sequel until it could be shown where it belonged: on the big silver screen, and most preferably an IMAX one. In other words, Cruise and company understood the film’s value and refused to settle for less.\n\nThe decision worked: “Top Gun: Maverick” opened during the Memorial Day weekend and grossed an astonishing $160.5 million. Now, I’ll grant you ticket prices have gone through the roof in the past 35 years, but still: the original “Top Gun” needed its entire theatrical run in 1986 to make that kind of cash.\n\nAnd here’s the good news: the sequel is fantastic, superior to the original in every single way. Truth be told, I did not care much for the original “Top Gun,” then and now. But that does not change the fact that this new film is exciting and suspenseful and – this is a surprise – actually has some emotional heft. It’s not a four-star film, and it’s not likely to be ranked among the best movies of the year, and its Oscar nominations surely will be for its technical merits only, but no matter. This is an old-fashioned, all-American summer blockbuster in peak form.\n\nAnd unless I am forgetting something, it’s also the first monster hit of the pandemic era that does not have a superhero in it. Thank God for that – I am all Marveled out, thank you very much.\n\nColumn:With Bruce Willis, we're reminded we don't always know what's happening to others behind the scenes\n\nValerie and I saw “Top Gun: Maverick” at the theater in Saco on Saturday. The theater was packed. I used to lament having to buy tickets online, but as Val and I headed to the theater on Saturday, I was glad to know that there were two seats there, waiting for us. I used to like being in long lines to see popular movies – standing and waiting to see the latest “Star Wars” or Indiana Jones film on a hot summer evening, for example, would give me the sense of being in the most exciting spot in the universe at that moment.\n\nThat’s the joy of going to see blockbusters, especially in the summertime: they are group events. Watching “Top Gun: Maverick,” I sensed a rapt attention in the audience and got caught up in it myself. And again, this is from a guy who had little use for the original “Top Gun.”\n\nReview:Tom Cruise's excellent 'Top Gun: Maverick' takes to the skies, sticks to the formula\n\nLeave it to Tom Cruise to restore good ol’ fashioned summer blockbuster movie-going, not just to its pre-pandemic days but to an even earlier time. Others have said this elsewhere, so I’ll just add to the chorus: Cruise really is the last of his kind, the last 1980s movie star still standing.\n\nMake what you will of his off-screen life, but on screen, Cruise is still getting it done. Few actors show his intensity and commitment to the movies they make. For quite a while there, it seemed as though Cruise was no longer challenging himself. Once, he had been a young actor who worked with legendary directors and stretched his acting skills in such films as “Rain Man,” “Born on the Fourth of July,” and, particularly, “Magnolia.” In his late forties and fifties, though, he seemed to be chasing the Fountain of Youth, starring almost exclusively in souped-up action films and sci-fi flicks.\n\nBut this new “Top Gun” movie shows this is not the case. In fact, the film casts a new light on his most recent “Mission Impossible” sequels, as well, as they are among the best action-adventure films of the past 50 years. It seems Cruise has shifted his focus, passion and his commitment – his mission, if you will. Perhaps one day, he will return to making movies like “Jerry Maguire” and “A Few Good Men,” but for now he is doing something equally of value.\n\nCruise is restoring the summer blockbuster, cutting through the barrage of superheroes and CGI effects and making top-notch crowd-pleasers that offer human stories, stunts without shortcuts, and actual sets and planes and cars and motorcycles and all that good stuff.\n\nSitting in the cinema on Saturday, watching “Top Gun: Maverick” and surveying the crowd, I felt something that I had not experienced in a while – something that I had feared the pandemic had destroyed for good.\n\nI felt the magic of the movies again.\n\nShawn P.

And they've just opened their first Florida spot ― right here in Naples.\n\nSo, of course, I had to drop everything and go.\n\nImmediately.\n\nI'm a huge fan of movies ― whether it's arthouse cinema or the latest Marvel/Star Wars blockbuster. And film nuts like me know and revere the name Alamo Drafthouse.\n\nDinner at your theater seat? A beautiful picture and sound you feel in your bones? A zero-tolerance policy for people who talk or text during the movie?\n\nThat sounds like paradise to me.\n\nTwo tickets, please.\n\nSilverspot left last summer, Alamo Drafthouse filled Mercato space\n\nI've been wanting to go to an Alamo Drafthouse ever since seeing a CBS Sunday Morning segment on the theater chain in 2016. But I thought I'd never get the chance.\n\nThen we got the news last year: Alamo was taking over the former Silverspot Cinema at North Naples' shopping center Mercato.\n\nWhy Naples? General manager Brock Cowgill says they'd been wanting to expand into Florida, and it was easier to move into a preexisting theater than to build an all-new one.\n\n\"But it's also a great market,\" Cowgill says. \"The southwest part of Florida is growing rapidly.\"\n\nWhatever their reasons, I'm glad they're here. So just six days after the Alamo opened April 29, my girlfriend Silvia and I climbed into my car and made the 45-minute drive south from Cape Coral to North Naples.\n\nAnd that long drive was totally worth it. Especially for Silvia, who stopped going to movie theaters years ago because of annoying people.\n\nYou know those people: Selfish Neanderthals who act like they're at home in their living room and babble loudly, text and generally show a disregard for anyone who might want to, you know, actually watch the movie.\n\nThose people are the worst. They deserve to get kicked out of the movies, but I've never once seen it happen at a Southwest Florida movie theater.\n\nShut up and watch the movie. Or else…\n\nNo one got kicked out Sunday at the Alamo, either. Or all opening week, Cowgill says.\n\nThe Alamo staff handed out some warnings, but the new theater is being relatively lenient until people get used to the rules. So you get TWO warnings instead of the usual one.\n\nThen again, you'd have to be pretty gutsy to talk or text at Alamo Drafthouse. The theater makes its policy crystal-clear. The waiters warn you. The theater signs warn you. The movie announcements warn you.\n\nTalk or text during the movie, and you'll be escorted out of the building.\n\nNo refunds.\n\nSee ya.\n\nThe theater chain actually delights in its zero-tolerance policy and sometimes makes fun of rude people who get kicked out. For proof, check out Alamo's hilarious YouTube clip of an angry customer leaving a verbally challenged voicemail message after being ejected.\n\nI have to admit: I kind of wanted to see someone get dragged out of the room by their heels, screaming and hollering as everyone else applauded and cheered. That would be soooo satisfying.\n\nOh well, maybe next time…\n\nActually, probably not. I'm sure the Alamo staff would be much more subtle about the whole ejection thing (and Cowgill confirms that). But still: It's fun to fantasize.\n\nAnyway, enough of those jerks. Back to the Alamo and this first-timers' experience at Movie Mecca.\n\nGolf with King Kong and Happy Gilmore\n\nYou know Alamo Drafthouse is different the moment you hit the second-floor at Mercato and you're greeted by a towering T-Rex, straight out of \"Jurassic Park.\"\n\nThat prehistoric theater greeter ushers you into the Alamo's cool world with a big, toothy, carnivorous grin. As if to say: \"Smile! We love movies here, too!\"\n\nThe T-Rex is part of Alamo's HappyLand Movie Mini Golf ― a putt-putt course with nine movie-themed holes, animatronic creatures and lots of sly movie references (such as the Baby Ruth \"doodie\" floating in the gutter on the \"Caddyshack\" hole).\n\nSilvia and I had a blast knocking golf balls between King Kong's legs, past \"Strange Brew's\" beer kegs and under a jungle gym piled with menacing crows from \"The Birds.\" Then, on the final \"Happy Gilmore\" hole, we used a hockey stick to fire the ball up and down a few ramps and into a waiting alligator's mouth.\n\nPro tip, though: Give yourself plenty of time if you plan to putt-putt and still make the movie. We got stuck behind several families with small kids, and let's just say this: None of them will be competing in the pros.\n\nSo we were a bit late to our movie's pre-show, which started at 3 p.m. before the actual trailers and movie at 3:30.\n\n\"Welcome to Alamo Drafthouse!\" our server Myra said with a friendly grin.\n\nWe grinned back, happy to finally be there.\n\nI didn’t catch much of that curated pre-show, but what I saw was cool. Each pre-show is different and tailored to the specific movie. Since we were watching the Ryan Gosling/Emily Blunt stuntman action-comedy \"The Fall Guy,\" our pre-show included a car-crash-filled trailer for an old Burt Reynolds movie and the opening credits for the 1981 TV series \"The Fall Guy,\" which loosely inspired the movie.\n\nSo yeah: Leave yourself plenty of time to see all the cool stuff at Alamo Drafthouse. That mini-golf course is just one of the things that make the place special, including a huge bar with 24 beers on tap and the vintage, foreign-language movie posters lining the hallway (such as \"Godfather Part II,\" \"Midnight Cowboy\" and the obscure 1972 horror flick \"Frogs\").\n\nWatching 'The Fall Guy,' eating a Royale with Cheese\n\nBy the time the movie started in theater No. 9, I was starving. We'd skipped lunch because we wanted to chow down on Alamo's expansive menu.\n\nAs the trailers rolled, we sat in the theater's reclining leather seats with attached mini tables ― reminding me of one of those desk-and-seat combos in school, only MUCH more comfortable ― and we started looking at the menu.\n\nThe ordering process is relatively simple: Before or during the movie, write down your order on a slip of paper. There's even a dim light to help you read and write. Then you pop the slip into a little stand and push a call button (a process, by the way, you can also use to narc on chatty, texting neighbors).\n\nAfter you order, a server quietly sweeps in like a ninja, squatting low to avoid blocking your view of the movie screen. The server glances at your menu, gives you a thumbs up and then disappears silently into the darkness.\n\nLike they never existed.\n\nSilvia ordered a pizza and a frozen margarita. I'm a huge \"Pulp Fiction\" fan, so I HAD to get the Royale with Cheese. There was simply no other choice.\n\nThen we sat back, relaxed and watched \"The Fall Guy\" in an amazing theater with eardrum-rattling 7.1 Dolby surround sound and high-end 4K laser projector.\n\nCowgill says \"The Fall Guy\" is the perfect movie to put Alamo to the test, and I have to agree. The picture was beautiful. And the sound system? Every explosion, every gunshot, every car crash shook your bones, vibrated your skin and felt raw, visceral and undeniable.\n\nThe movie, itself, was lots of fun. I'd watch Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in almost anything, but \"The Fall Guy\" turned out to be a great summer blockbuster: Pulse-pounding action, jaw-dropping stunts, lots of laughs (stunt dog Jean-Claude steals the show), lots of romance and a deep respect for movies and the people who make them (something I know Alamo can relate to).\n\nThe one downside about my Alamo experience, unfortunately, was the food. When it arrived, our burger and pizza were lukewarm and the lettuce on my cheeseburger was wilted and soggy. We suspect the food sat waiting for a while before someone finally brought it out to us.\n\nBut it's not a dealbreaker. Alamo had only been open six days, so they've probably worked out more of those kinks since then. The fries, at least, were delicious: Crispy, flavorful and hot.\n\nAnd Alamo made up for that so-so lunch with its salty-sweet churro popcorn: A big metal bowl filled with buttered popcorn, cinnamon-sugar and satisfying bits of crunchy, fried churro.\n\nWe happily devoured every last bit until our fingers were sticky.\n\nThe Alamo experience: We'll be back.\n\nTwo hours later, the bad guys were vanquished on-screen and the movie credits rolled. And we'd officially concluded our first Alamo Drafthouse experience.\n\nIt was a terrific Sunday-afternoon date. Silvia and I had a great time and will likely return again soon.\n\nWe love movies. Alamo Drafthouse loves movies.\n\nIt's a perfect match.\n\nNow if we can just get them to open a theater in Fort Myers, too. And who knows? Maybe it'll happen some day.\n\nAlamo does indeed want to expand elsewhere in Florida, Cowgill says. So our fingers are crossed.\n\nUntil then, Silvia and I will make that journey south to Naples and the Alamo Drafthouse, where movies and movie fans are treated with respect.\n\nAnd where talkers and texters get dragged out screaming ― if only in my imagination.\n\nMore about Naples' new Alamo Drafthouse Cinema\n\nHere’s more about Alamo Drafthouse Cinema's first location in Florida:\n\nAlamo Drafthouse Cinema opened April 29 in the old Silverspot Cinema at The Mercato, 9118 Strada Place, Unit 8205, North Naples.\n\nIt's the first Florida location for the Austin, Texas, theater chain.\n\nAlong with Alamo's no talking, no texting rule, the theater chain also bans late arrivals. If the movie starts at 7 p.m. and you get there at 7:15, too bad. They will, however, let you exchange your ticket for a different show time or day.\n\nThe 33,652-square-foot space features 11 theater rooms outfitted with laser and xenon movie projectors. There are four 4K projectors in rooms 2, 9, 10 and 11.\n\nAll theaters are equipped with \"eardrum-rattling\" 7.1 Dolby surround sound.\n\nAll theaters offer dine-in service at your seat, brought to you silently by what Alamo calls its \"ninja-trained\" staff.\n\nSeats can be reserved in-person, online or on the Alamo Drafthouse app.\n\nThe theater offers a mix of new blockbusters, independent movies and classics.\n\nThe 50-seat bar next to HappyLand Movie Mini Golf features 24 beers on tap, including beers from Dogfish Head, Cigar City, 7venth Sun and J.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” is summer’s first blockbuster, boasting breathless reviews and what will likely be the biggest box office in Tom Cruise’s storied, 35-plus-year Hollywood career.\n\nDean Obeidallah CNN\n\nBut there’s another potential blockbuster coming that I hope eclipses the audience for “Top Gun”: I’m talking about the January 6 committee public hearings, set to premiere on June 9. Just look at the advance buzz:\n\n“The story of the worst presidential political offense against the Union in American history,” declares US Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the January 6 committee.\n\n“It’s going to blow the roof off the House,” Raskin exclaims.\n\nThe hearings will have “tens of thousands of exhibits” and a cast of “hundreds of witnesses,” says Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee chairman.\n\nAnd while “Top Gun” was just one film, the January 6 committee hearings are expected to be an eight-episode extravaganza. Some installments are even scheduled to air in prime time.\n\nThere are obviously big differences between the two attractions, starting with the degree of star power. In the “Top Gun” sequel, Cruise, who gets top billing, is joined by Hollywood A-listers Miles Teller and Jon Hamm.\n\nBut the roster of potential talent lined up for the January 6 hearings is not too shabby. The final cast has still not been locked in but could reportedly include a handful of former officials from the Department of Justice who Trump allegedly pressured for help in his failed bid to overturn the 2020 election. We might even see cameo appearances, via video clip, of previously recorded testimony by marquee players such as Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner.\n\nHowever, the key difference between the two dramas – and it’s not a small one – is that the only objective of the new “Top Gun” movie is to entertain.\n\nThe January 6 committee hearings, meanwhile, have the vitally important goal of making the case to the American public that Trump and key players in his entourage engaged in a behind-the-scenes effort to overthrow the 2020 election. And the proceedings aim to show that they may have had more than a bit part in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nNow, we don’t truly know what to expect once the hearings begin. As with the “Top Gun” film that was kept secret from the public for nearly two years after its completion to allow shuttered theaters to reopen following the pandemic, January 6 committee staffers are working in secrecy on final edits before the big release date.\n\nBut if rumors swirling around the production are correct, the hearings will open with an overview of the panel’s 10-month investigation, then introduce the riveting storyline and a number of key players in the political melodrama.\n\nLike a matinee that hasn’t opened yet, but which the audience has seen the trailer for, the public is hungry to know more about the coming attractions.\n\nWill there be surprise appearances – maybe a cameo from someone such as former Vice President Mike Pence? And how will Donald Trump respond to allegations about his potential role in the drama, including reports this past week that he allegedly welcomed chants from January 6 protesters of “hang Mike Pence”?\n\nAnother riveting question is whether the Department of Justice will prosecute some or all of the figures implicated in the January 6 unrest – assuming the committee’s case is sufficiently compelling. And what if one of those individuals implicated happens to include the former President? Just a few weeks ago, the department requested witness transcripts from the committee, so federal prosecutors might be keeping their options open on that front.\n\nIf the January 6 hearings do lead to the criminal prosecution of Trump, that could of course lead to a blockbuster that will blow the current attraction out of the water. It would be a sequel even bigger than the original “Trump on Trial” miniseries – his two impeachments. And who knows? Down the road, a future spinoff of Trump’s hit network reality show might be called “The Apprentice: Rikers Island edition.”\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

I’m reminded of one of the most famous lines from the original “Top Gun,” when the two main protagonists, Maverick and Goose, declared: “I feel the need … the need for speed.” From where I sit, it’s no longer about speed. I desperately “feel the need … the need for justice.”\n\nIf the January 6 committee hearings can help achieve that, it will truly be the biggest blockbuster of this summer.", "authors": ["Dean Obeidallah"], "publish_date": "2022/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/08/07/bullet-train-30-point-1-million-first-weekend-box-office/10261350002/", "title": "'Bullet Train' grossed $30.1 million in first weekend at box office", "text": "Jake Coyle\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNew York — The stylized action romp \"Bullet Train,\" starring Brad Pitt, arrived with a $30.1 million opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, as the last big movie of Hollywood's summer recovery landed in theaters.\n\nThe \"Bullet Train\" debut for Sony Pictures was solid but unspectacular for a movie that cost $90 million to make and was propelled by Pitt's substantial star power. Even if it holds well in coming weeks, movie theaters have no major studio releases on the horizon for the rest of August, and few sure things to look forward to in early fall.\n\nWhile late summer is always a quiet period in theaters, it will be especially so this year — and likely to sap some of the momentum stirred by \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"Jurassic World: Dominion,\" \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" and others. After a comeback season that pushed the box office close to pre-pandemic levels, it's about to get pretty quiet in cinemas.\n\n\"It's definitely going to be quieter, like the calm after the storm,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \"But that doesn't mean there's not going to be great movies out there and perhaps the good will generated by some of those films might be enough to buoy the box office until we get into the blockbuster corridor with 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' and 'Avatar 2' down the road. We have to expect that we're not going to be able to keep up the pace we had this summer.\"\n\n'Got in trouble for that':Brad Pitt talks stunts, renegade 'Troy' ATV ride as moving arrow target\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Bullet Train':Brad Pitt charms, but his A-list action flick mostly goes off the rails\n\nAs the last big summer movie to leave the station, \"Bullet Train\" hopes to keep riding for the coming weeks. That would be in line with the playbook of some other original, August-released summer movies like \"Free Guy\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" Directed by David Leitch (\"Atomic Blonde,\" \"Deadpool 2\"), \"Bullet Train\" gathers a number of assassins (co-stars include Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry) together on a speeding train running from Tokyo to Kyoto.\n\nAs one of the few original would-be summer blockbusters without big-name intellectual property behind it, the R-rated \"Bullet Train\" might have come into the weekend with more momentum if reviews had been stronger. With a low 54% fresh rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, \"Bullet Train\" was only slightly better received by audiences, who gave the film a B+ CinemaScore. The film added $32.4 million in overseas box office.\n\nThe weekend's other new wide release, \"Easter Sunday,\" struggled to catch on. The Universal Pictures comedy, starring comic Jo Koy as an actor attending his family's Easter Sunday celebration, won praise for its Filipino representation but drew even worse reviews than \"Bullet Train.\" It opened with $5.3 million in ticket sales.\n\nInstead, \"Bullet Train\" was trailed by a number of holdovers, including Warner Bros.' \"DC League of Pets.\" The animated release grossed $11.2 million in its second week of release.\n\nJordan Peele's \"Nope,\" the Universal sci-fi horror release, continued to perform well, earning $8.5 million in its third weekend. With $98 million in tickets sold, \"Nope\" will soon surpass $100 million at the domestic box office.\n\nRelated:Bad Bunny still can't believe his 'Bullet Train' role required trying to screen kill Brad Pitt\n\nMore:You saw Jordan Peele's 'Nope' and have SO MANY burning questions. We have answers.\n\nTaika Waititi's \"Thor: Love and Thunder,\" for the Walt Disney Co., came in fourth with $7.6 million in its fifth weekend. It's now up to $316.1 million, making it the highest grossing Thor movie domestically. With $699 million globally, \"Love and Thunder\" is less likely to catch the $854 million worldwide haul of 2017's \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"\n\nIn limited release, A24's \"Bodies Bodies Bodies\" launched on six screens in New York and Los Angeles with $226,525 in ticket sales, good for a per-screen average of $37,754. The horror comedy about rich 20-somethings at a remote house party, with a cast including Amandla Sternberg, Maria Bakalova and Pete Davidson, expands nationwide on Friday.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

Yet there's at least one big difference between this year and several past summers: the superhero movie is no longer at the forefront.\n\nAfter a tougher-than-expected past year for Marvel Studios and its parent company Disney, and DC Studios at work rebooting its cinematic universe starting with next year's \"Superman,\" the only comic book movie either will release this summer is \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" — which, with an R-rating and decidedly snarky tone, isn't exactly your typical superhero movie anyway.\n\nYet that doesn't mean there'll be a shortage of big-name franchises on screens this summer, with \"Planet of the Apes,\" \"A Quiet Place\" and \"Alien\" among the series debuting new entries, as well as a few original concepts. And after an Oscars year where one of last summer's biggest box-office hits, Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer,\" ended up winning Best Picture, all eyes are on this year's summer movie slate to see if any film might replicate its awards-season success — possibly including the prequel to a movie that won six Oscars and was nominated for ten.\n\nHere is our guide to the biggest films coming out from May to August, listed in chronological order.

The movie received positive reviews following its South by Southwest premiere, with many praising it as a tribute to the stunt community, which director David Leitch worked in before co-directing the first \"John Wick\" with fellow stuntman Chad Stahelski.\n\n'Tarot' (May 3)\n\nAfter creepy dolls (the \"Annabelle\" and \"The Boy\" films), mobile apps (\"Countdown\") and swimming pools (\"Night Swim\"), it looks like the next object ready to kill you are tarot cards. Avantika, of this year's \"Mean Girls\" remake, and Jacob Batalon of the current \"Spider-Man\" movies are among the stars of this horror film based on the 1992 novel \"Horrorscope\" by first-time feature directors Spenser Cohen and Anna Halberg.\n\n'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' (May 10)\n\nAfter a trilogy of films in the 2010s that revived the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise by using motion capture to embody the apes, the same concept returns in this sequel directed by Wes Ball (the \"Maze Runner\" movies.) Owen Teague, a Tampa-born actor who performed in Sarasota area theatrical productions before a successful film and TV career, plays the lead motion-capture role — a position previously held by Andy Serkis of \"Lord of the Rings\" fame, who portrayed chimpanzee Caesar in the last three films.\n\n'Back to Black' (May 17)\n\nMarisa Abela, star of HBO/BBC Two series \"Industry,\" portrays singer Amy Winehouse, whose 2006 sophomore album \"Back to Black\" was a major commercial and critical success that launched her into stardom until — as she struggled with substance abuse, mental illness, relationships and paparazzi — she died in 2011 at 27 years old. \"Back to Black\" has received lackluster reviews, but so did fellow musician biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" before becoming a box-office hit and winning four Oscars, so your mileage may vary.\n\n'IF' (May 17)\n\nAfter directing the first two entries in the horror franchise \"A Quiet Place\" (which returns this summer as well; keep reading), John Krasinski goes another route for his next film, a children's movie set in a world where imaginary friends (or IFs) really exist. Krasinski co-stars with Ryan Reynolds, Cailey Fleming and a voice cast that includes Steve Carell, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Matt Damon, Maya Rudolph, Jon Stewart, George Clooney, Bradley Cooper, the late Louis Gossett Jr., and Krasinski's real-life wife, Emily Blunt.\n\n'The Strangers: Chapter 1' (May 17)\n\nThe horror movie series centered around murderous, mask-donning home invaders has a new trilogy of films planned, starting with this one. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the upcoming films is their director, Renny Harlin, a South Florida resident who helmed '90s blockbusters such as \"Die Hard 2,\" \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Deep Blue Sea,\" but hasn't had a real box-office hit in America since then.\n\n'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga' (May 24)\n\nGeorge Miller returns to the post-apocalyptic wastelands of his \"Mad Max\" world for this prequel following the early days of Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy, playing a younger version of the character introduced in 2015's \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" portrayed by Charlize Theron in that film), with Chris Hemsworth co-starring as Warlord Dementus. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" was a big success not only commercially but critically, winning six Oscars and since being regarded as one of the best action films of all time, so expectations are high for this one.\n\n'The Garfield Movie' (May 24)\n\nThe lazy, lasagna-loving cat gets his latest adaptation from the comics page to the big screen, following two critically panned films in the 2000s with a Bill Murray-voiced CGI Garfield and live-action actors. This latest entry is fully animated and features Chris Pratt voicing Garfield, with studio heads surely hoping it has the same commercial success as Pratt's previous voice-acting vehicles, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" and \"The Lego Movie.\"\n\n'Summer Camp' (May 31)\n\nDiane Keaton, Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard star in this comedy as three women who've been friends since summer camp, but as the years have passed, see each other less and less — that is, until the chance of a summer camp reunion arises. Bradenton native Castille Landon writes and directs the film with a cast that also includes Eugene Levy, Dennis Haysbert, Josh Peck and Beverly D'Angelo.\n\n'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' (June 7)\n\nMiami Police Department detectives Mike and Marcus (played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, respectively) return for this fourth entry in the action film franchise, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the directors of 2020's relatively well-received \"Bad Boys For Life,\" also returning. This is the first wide theatrical release for Smith since 2022's Oscars ceremony where he infamously slapped Chris Rock, and a test of his box-office appeal now.\n\n'The Watchers' (June 7)\n\nM. Night Shyamalan's daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan makes her feature directorial debut with this horror film based on the novel by A.M. Shine, following a young woman (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself part of a group that is watched every night by mysterious creatures. Between this film and M. Night Shyamalan's own new movie coming out in August, co-starring his other daughter Saleka Shyamalan (keep reading), it'll be a busy summer for the family.\n\n'Inside Out 2' (June 14)\n\nThe Pixar movie featuring personified versions of emotions such as Joy (Amy Poehler), Anger (Lewis Black) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) gets a sequel, introducing new feelings including Anxiety (Maya Hawke) and Envy (Ayo Edebiri.) Pixar's track record hasn't been as strong these past two decades as it was in the '90s and '00s, especially when it comes to sequels. Yet 2015's Oscar-winning \"Inside Out\" was one of the highlights of Pixar's more recent releases, so hopefully this sequel can measure up to the original.\n\n'The Bikeriders' (June 21)\n\nJeff Nichols' first film since 2016's Oscar-nominated \"Loving,\" \"The Bikeriders\" is inspired by Danny Lyon's 1967 photobook of the same name but follows a fictional motorcycle club, with a cast that includes Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy. Despite positive reviews following its Telluride Film Festival premiere last fall, the movie was taken off the release calendar by original distributor 20th Century Studios. Thankfully, Focus Features picked it up soon after, and gave it a summer release date that suggests confidence in its box-office potential.\n\n'Horizon: An American Saga' ('Chapter 1' June 28, 'Chapter 2' Aug. 16)\n\nAfter starring in the hit series \"Yellowstone,\" Costner is returning to the big screen both in front of and behind the camera for his first directorial feature since 2003's \"Open Range,\" and nearly 35 years since his 1990 Best Picture Oscar winner \"Dances with Wolves.\" Though \"Horizon: An America Saga\" looks to have a similar Western setting as those two previous films, one interesting aspect is that it'll be released in two parts over the summer.\n\n'A Quiet Place: Day One' (June 28)\n\nThe prequel and third film in the \"A Quiet Place\" series goes back to the day where the creatures that hunt through hearing were unleashed on humanity. Along with a predominantly new cast that includes Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o in the lead role, \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" features a new director in Michael Sarnoski, who made a big impression with his previous debut feature, the 2021 Nicolas Cage-starring indie \"Pig.\"\n\n'Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F' (July 3 on Netflix)\n\nUnlike the early days of the pandemic, nearly all this year's big summer movies will debut in theaters, yet one notable exception is this Netflix film that has Eddie Murphy return to one of his best-known roles, Axel Foley. Murphy's last sequel \"Coming 2 America\" was a disappointment, but he was great in the 2019 Netflix film \"Dolemite is My Name.\" Likely the deciding factor in the film's favor is if it's R-rated, which \"Dolemite is My Name,\" the original \"Coming to America\" and the previous \"Beverly Hills Cop\" films all were, or PG-13 like \"Coming 2 America.\"\n\n'Despicable Me 4' (July 3)\n\nFormer supervillain Gru (Steve Carell), the Minions and the rest return for the latest film in the animated movie franchise (along with Pharrell Williams, potentially inflicting another inescapable hit song like \"Happy\" upon us), with Will Ferrell and Sofia Vergara voicing the antagonists. The series has steadily gotten less favorable reviews since the 2010 original, but it's also one of the highest-grossing franchises of all time, so another sequel was inevitable.\n\n'MaXXXine' (July 5)\n\nAfter the '70s-set horror film \"X\" and its 1910s-set prequel \"Pearl,\" director Ti West completes his trilogy with this film following Maxine (Mia Goth) as she continues to seek fame in 1980s Los Angeles while evading the Night Stalker serial killer. Primarily known for its indies, A24 has lately been looking to gain more box-office power with films like \"Civil War\" — which had both the largest budget and biggest opening weekend of any A24 movie to date — and, judging by the prime summer date they gave it, they see commercial potential in \"MaXXXine.\"\n\n'Fly Me to the Moon' (July 12)\n\nThis romantic comedy set amid the Apollo 11 launch follows a NASA director (Channing Tatum) and a marketing specialist (Scarlett Johansson) preparing a staged moon landing as a back-up plan. (The trailer ends on a joke that references the conspiracy theory that Stanley Kubrick directed the fake landing.) \"Fly Me to the Moon\" filmed in Florida at Kennedy Space Center, then under the title \"Project Artemis,\" as well as Georgia.\n\n'Longlegs' (July 12)\n\nThe horror film follows an FBI agent (Maika Monroe) who's assigned to the unsolved case of a serial killer (Nicolas Cage), with the investigation uncovering evidence of the occult. Director Osgood Perkins (son of \"Psycho\" actor Anthony Perkins) has shown a skill for mood and atmosphere with previous films of his such as \"The Blackcoat's Daughter\" and \"Gretel & Hansel,\" and based on this film's multiple eerie teasers, that remains the case here.\n\n'Twisters' (July 19)\n\nThe sequel to the 1996 weather disaster film \"Twister\" introduces a new cast of stars including Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell and Anthony Ramos. It also has an intriguing choice of director in Lee Isaac Chung, who previously helmed the 2020 Oscar-winning family drama \"Minari,\" with a story by Joseph Kosinski, who himself directed the successful, decades-later sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\n'Deadpool & Wolverine' (July 26)\n\nMasked mercenary Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and claw-wielding X-Man Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) team up in what's far from their first on-screen appearance, but does mark each character's Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, as well as the MCU's first R-rated movie. The 2017 film \"Logan\" was such a fitting farewell for Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine that perhaps it should've been left as the final one. But it's always fun to see Jackman in the role especially since — like \"Logan\" — he'll be let loose by an R rating here.\n\n'Harold and the Purple Crayon' (Aug. 2)\n\nThe 1955 children's book about a boy whose magic purple crayon can create whatever he draws gets a modern-day movie adaptation featuring a grown-up version of Harold, played by \"Shazam!\" star Zachary Levi. \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" is directed by Carlos Saldanha, known for his work on the \"Ice Age\" and \"Rio\" movies, as well as fellow animated films \"Robots\" and \"Ferdinand.\"\n\n'Borderlands' (Aug. 9)\n\nThe latest video game film adaptation follows a group comprising outlaw Lilith (Cate Blanchett), former mercenary Roland (Kevin Hart), demolitionist Tiny Tina (Ariana Greenblatt), her protector Krieg (Florian Munteanu), scientist Tannis (Jamie Lee Curtis) and robot Claptrap (Jack Black) as they battle alien monsters and bandits in search of a missing girl. While \"Borderlands\" has a strong (one might say overqualified) cast, it's also had a troubled history that includes years of release date delays, weeks of reshoots and screenwriter Craig Mazin taking his name off the film.\n\n'Cuckoo' (Aug. 9)\n\n\"Euphoria\" actress Hunter Schafer stars in this horror film as an American teenager who relocates to a German Alps resort her father has just moved into, growing unnerved by her new surroundings and her father's boss (Dan Stevens, having a busy year between this, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" and \"Abigail.\") \"Cuckoo\" premiered at this year's Berlin International Film Festival, screening at South by Southwest soon after.\n\n'It Ends with Us' (Aug. 9)\n\nThis film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's 2016 novel — which experienced a revival in interest in the 2020s thanks to TikTok's #BookTok community, becoming the best-selling book of both 2022 and 2023, according to Publishers Weekly — follows a woman (Blake Lively) whose parents had an abusive relationship as she starts to see signs of that same behavior in her own relationship with a neurosurgeon (Justin Baldoni.) Baldoni also directs the adaption of the novel that, since he optioned the project, now has a sequel, 2022's \"It Starts with Us.\"\n\n'Trap' (Aug. 9)\n\nM. Night Shyamalan's latest film stars as Josh Hartnett as a father who takes his daughter to see a concert by pop star Lady Raven (Shyamalan's own musician daughter, Saleka), only to learn the event is a police trap to catch a serial killer known as The Butcher and, as the trailer suggests, the father is The Butcher. This being a M. Night Shyamalan movie, though, don't be surprised if there's another twist or two from there.\n\n'Alien: Romulus' (Aug. 16)\n\nThe latest entry in the sci-fi/horror franchise takes place between the events of the original \"Alien\" and its sequel \"Aliens,\" with a cast led by \"Priscilla\" star Cailee Spaeny. While none of the franchise's later films have reached the heights of Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" and James Cameron's \"Aliens,\" it's always fun to see a new director's take on the material, and \"Alien: Romulus\" director Fede Álvarez — who, in his \"Evil Dead\" remake and \"Don't Breathe,\" displayed a penchant for scares and gross-outs — seems like a solid choice.\n\n'Blink Twice' (Aug. 23)\n\nActress Zoë Kravitz makes her directorial debut with this film following a cocktail waitress (Naomi Ackie) who gets invited by a tech mogul (Kravitz's fiancé Channing Tatum) to visit his private island, where things start to go wrong. With an intriguing premise and a strong cast that also includes Christian Slater, Simon Rex, Adria Arjona, Kyle MacLachlan, Haley Joel Osment, Geena Davis and Alia Shawkat, hopefully this will be a late-summer surprise in the vein of 2022's \"Barbarian.\"\n\n'The Crow' (Aug. 23)\n\nThis remake of the 1994 film follows a man (Bill Skarsgård) who's brought back from the dead to seek revenge on the criminals who killed him and his fiancée (musician FKA twigs.) While the original \"The Crow\" isn't perfect, it also wasn't exactly asking to be remade, especially considering how much the movie is tied to the tragic death of its lead Brandon Lee. Yet a remake was probably inevitable — it's been in the works for 16 years now, under different directors and actors — and at least this one's choice of its two leads is interesting.\n\nEmail entertainment reporter Jimmy Geurts at jimmy.geurts@heraldtribune.com.

But this season has been brutal on originality. And as much as moviegoers claim they want fresh stories, they are plunking down less money on them than ever and embracing sequels, remakes and spinoffs instead.\n\nA Gannett/USA TODAY analysis of more than two decades of summer box-office receipts finds that Hollywood has never been more derivative. Among the top 20 summer films dating to 1993:\n\n• Original films accounted for just 39% of box office from 2003-12, down from 65% in the prior 10 years.\n\n• So far this summer, original stories account for just 30% of ticket sales.\n\n• Original movies accounted for less than half (47%) of the top summer releases from 2003-12, down from 70% the decade prior.\n\nThis summer has been particularly stingy with big-budget original films. The $135 million animated comedy Turbo has mustered just $70 million. Pacific Rim, the $190 million monster movie, has done $94 million. And the $150 million White House Down remains in the red with a box office haul of $72 million.\n\nWheeler Winston Dixon, professor of film studies at the University of Nebraska and author of several books on Hollywood, says studios and fans share equal blame for the dearth of new stories.\n\n\"Films today routinely cost $100 to $200 million, and with that kind of money at stake, who has time for originality? It's much safer to bank on a profitable franchise.\"\n\nAnd Dixon places viewer blame squarely on the shoulders of fanboys — particularly those who have made San Diego's Comic-Con a pop media Woodstock.\n\n\"Filmmaking today seems driven by the Comic-Con fan base, and that's the sure sign of the kiss of death for anything even remotely out of the ordinary,\" he says, noting the genre's dependency on serialized writing. \"Comic-book movies have moved to the mainstream, displacing more thoughtful, adult fare.\"\n\nBut Robert McKee, a screenwriting lecturer whose character was portrayed in the Nicolas Cage film Adaptation, says the criticism of sequels is film \"snobbery.\"\n\nSequels \"have always been around,\" he says. \"Homer's Odyssey is the sequel to The Iliad. Shakespeare turned sequels into trilogies. Audiences love sequels because they get hooked on a character like Odysseus in the first story and want to enjoy him again and again.\"\n\nMore importantly, he says, \"hits don't steal audiences from other films. No one who would have seen The Place Beyond the Pines went to see Iron Man 3 instead. If they liked good movies, they saw both.\"\n\nThat will be the ultimate measure of the $115 million Elysium.\n\n\"Original story or not, this could be big,\" says Jeff Bock, vice president of Exhibitor Relations. \"It has a hot director and puts Matt Damon against the world, a role fans love. Stars still go a long way in this business.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/09/spielberg-schindler-list-20th-anniversary/1973203/", "title": "Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' marks 20th anniversary", "text": "Steve Jones, USA TODAY\n\nWinner of seven Academy Awards restored and released on Blu-ray for the first time\n\nLiam Neeson stars in title role as German merchant who saved Polish Jews from Nazis during WWII\n\nSomber black-and-white film depicts brutality experienced by Holocaust victims\n\nFilm is considered one of the greatest ever and earned Spielberg new level of respect as a director\n\nRarely does a box office hit have such a profound emotional impact on its audience that it resonates long after the viewing is done. But Steven Spielberg's acclaimed black-and-white masterpiece Schindler's List did just that. The stark drama about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who risked his own life and fortune to save more than 1,100 Polish Jews during the Holocaust by giving them work in his factories, is considered one of the best films ever made.\n\nSchindler's List 20th Anniversary Limited Edition (1993, Universal, R, $23; Blu-ray, $35), whose meticulous restoration was overseen by Spielberg himself, is now available in pristine high-definition for home video.\n\nLiam Neeson stars as Schindler, a Nazi Party member who comes to Krakow, Poland, hoping to get rich off of the war. He opens a factory to make goods for the German war effort, but needs the help of his Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley) to run it. Germany has moved Polish refugees to the city and sent psychotic Schutzstaffel officer Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennes) to build a concentration camp. Initially, Schindler hires the Polish Jews as cheap labor, but as he witnesses the increasing brutality of Nazis, he uses his influence to keep as many of his workers as he can from being sent to their deaths in Auschwitz.\n\nThe film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, winning seven including best picture, adapted screenplay, cinematography, art direction, film editing, original score (John Williams) and director for Spielberg. Neeson and Fiennes were nominated for best actor and supporting actor, respectively. For Spielberg — who basically invented the summer blockbuster with films like Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park — Schindler's List meant a higher level of artistic respect.\n\nSpielberg first became interested in the Holocaust story 10 years earlier, when his mentor, then-MCA president Sid Sheinberg, sent him a copy of a New York Times book review of Australian author Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel Schindler's Ark. Keneally had written the book after talking to Poldek Pfefferberg, who survived the Holocaust thanks to Schindler. At the time, Spielberg didn't think he had the maturity or gravitas to make a movie about the topic, and tried to convince other directors to do it. He did, however, meet with Pfefferberg, who was credited under the name Leopold Page when the film was made years later. The film was shot in 1993 at actual locations in Krakow, though filmmakers had to rebuild the prison camp.\n\nAmong the bonus features​ is a documentary with the director talking about how making the film inspired him to establish the USC Shoah Foundation — The Institute for Visual History and Education. Since 1994, the organization has collected more than 50,000 videotaped interviews with survivors and other witnesses to the Holocaust. The archive is used as a basis for numerous college courses and other educational programs. Another documentary, Voices from the List, features testimonies from some of those who were saved by Oskar Schindler.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/25/filmscene-iowa-city-big-screen-says-goodbye-longtime-employee-quiet-place-rebecca-fons/4994478001/", "title": "FilmScene brings back big screen, says goodbye to longtime ...", "text": "The FilmScene theater had never been dark for even a single night in more than seven years of operation, according to co-founder Andrew Sherburne.\n\n“I think for us there's a lot of anticipation and build-up to getting back to that opening night again,\" Sherburne said. \"I think there’s a lot of ‘first day of school’ excitement for us.\"\n\nStill recovering from the long, dark spell of COVID-19, that excitement will be realized on Friday as after 438 days FilmScene screens are ignited again with sound and color.\n\n\"It felt really good to book a movie. It felt really good to confirm that it had come in,\" programming director Rebecca Fons said. \"Ross (Meyer, FilmScene's head projectionist) put up a poster in the lobby, we made sure we had enough popcorn.”\n\nThough the venue has offered private screenings and been a satellite location for the revamped Sundance Film Festival for a weekend, the theater has not scheduled any indoor screenings open to the general public for more than a year.\n\n\"FilmScene at the Chauncey will open with public screenings in Theater 1 and Theater 2 with limited max capacity (42%) to ensure distanced seating between groups,\" reads the May 18 announcement of reopening. \"Theater 3 will be open for private movie party rentals of new release and classic films.

More information, as well as a detailed list of precautions, can be found on FilmScene's website for those who plan to return to the theater.\n\n“Once you account for that reduction in capacity, I think we’re already kind of bumping up to a sell-out opening night,\" Sherburne said on Monday, anticipating all available seats be occupied come Friday. \"It really shows that people are clamoring to get out into the community and do things they missed over the past year.”\n\nThough FilmScene first opened in 2013, the nonprofit theater garnered a long-sought additional space in September 2019 when it was installed as the primary tenant on the ground floor of the Chauncey Building. While the new facilities expanded the theater's reach and ability, the space perhaps has yet to be fully realized given COVID-19's interruption of its use a mere seven months into its life.\n\nMore:Englert Theatre announces free outdoor performance series Mission Creek Summer Sessions\n\nThat life is beginning to gradually resume and ramp up with the theater's upcoming offerings. For this return, FilmScene is screening \"A Quiet Place Part II,\" the sequel to the 2018 film written by University of Iowa alumni Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. Though Beck and Woods did not return for the sequel, the new movie is once again directed by John Krasinski.\n\n“This film signifies the changing of the seasons,\" said Fons, \"because we’re entering into summer blockbuster season but we’re also entering into the season of going back to movie theaters so that’s very exciting.”\n\nMore:FilmScene in the Park launches April 21 in Iowa City, with more free movies to follow\n\nThat upcoming blockbuster season consists of other movies that, like \"A Quiet Place Part II,\" were originally intended for 2020 releases. In the coming months, FilmScene's offerings include the adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway hit \"In the Heights\" and the Arthurian-inspired \"The Green Knight\" alongside films like \"Zola\" and \"The Sparks Brothers.\"\n\nThough Fons plans to attend FilmScene's reopening weekend, speaking to audiences before the film as is typical for the theater, the movies she's working to bring back now are among the last she'll be booking for the indie theater.\n\nAfter nearly four years at the local theater, Fons is taking up the role of programming director at the Gene Siskel Film Center, a job being worked concurrently as she finishes her time at FilmScene. A new programming director is expected to be announced within the next month. Fons was among the Press-Citizen's annual \"People to Watch\" list for 2018.\n\nReflecting on her time with the Iowa City theater, Fons said she'll miss the FilmScene colleagues and the people most.\n\n\"And that includes the community of people that make up our audience,\" she said. \"There’s a fourth wall to a film and you can’t talk to the film and you can’t get to know the film… it’s about who you’re watching it with.”\n\n“She arrived in a moment where we’d just gone to two screens and now we have grown to two locations, five screens and an outdoor cinema and over the course of that growth, Rebecca’s been a steady presence,\" Sherburne said. “I’m so glad she’s going to be here for our reopening. I wouldn’t have it any other way, and I think it’s a fitting time to make a handoff to someone new to build on that… she’s leaving us in a really good place.”\n\nIsaac Hamlet covers arts, entertainment and culture at the Press-Citizen.

This year is no different, but there is one notable change for families.\n\n“One thing that really stands out to me this year is the variety,” said Elizabeth Ringas, president of American Coaster Enthusiasts, which describes itself as the world's largest club of amusement ride enthusiasts. “While we’ve got the big and the bad, there’s also a great focus on family rides.”\n\nUnlike traditional kiddie coasters aimed at preschoolers, the latest generation of family coasters are designed for multiple generations to enjoy together – like Dollywood’s Big Bear Mountain, which debuted last year.\n\n“It’s not about being necessarily a tame ride,” Ringas said, explaining that with new technology, ride manufacturers can smooth, solid rides for wider audiences. “It's about the height requirement and the number of people that can ride it.”\n\nHere are some of the most anticipated roller coasters opening in 2024 for thrill seekers of all ages:\n\nMark your calendar:Here's when your favorite amusement parks are opening this year\n\nFire in the Hole at Silver Dollar City\n\nSilver Dollar City’s new Fire in the Hole will be “the Heartland's largest indoor coaster” and “biggest investment in a single attraction” to date, according to the park.\n\n“It's a perfect addition to Silver Dollar City. They’re a resort where you want to stay, and the whole family comes,” Ringas said. “Again, it's that whole family niche.”\n\nThe new coaster, which carries on the name of a previous coaster at the park, will combine a dark ride and roller coaster, with most of the coaster action in the latter part of the ride.\n\n“The coaster experience, with a powered incline and gravity descent, including three drops and a quick splash-landing, promises a thrilling ride,” according to the park’s website. “In addition, a custom soundtrack with high-resolution onboard audio, show lighting effects and enhanced special effects, like using fiber optics to create a fast-burning fuse, heightens the ride experience and brings the Fire in the Hole story to life.”\n\n◾ Opening: March 30\n\n◾ Location: Branson, Missouri\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 26 mph\n\n◾ Track length: 1,512 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: 2 minutes, 51 seconds overall\n\nMinimum height requirement: 36 inches with a supervising companion or 48 inches solo.\n\nGeorgia Surfer at Six Flags Over Georgia\n\n“Georgia Surfer is bringing a totally new coaster experience to the park,” according to Six Flags Over Georgia’s website. “Riders will launch forward and backward along nearly 590 feet of track, reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, hitting the ride’s 144-foot peak before coasting down into a scenic splash pool. Free-spinning seats ensure no two rides are alike.”\n\nRingas said unique coasters like this usually tend to debut overseas.\n\n“A lot of coaster enthusiasts are always like, ‘Oh, I’ve got to get to Europe.’ ” she said. “So when they come to the U.S., and we don't have to travel over the ocean to get to it, it's just really exciting. And I like seeing that the American market is expanding into some of those more unique coasters.”\n\n◾ Opening: Summer\n\n◾ Location: Austell, Georgia\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 60 mph\n\n◾ Track length: Nearly 590 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: Not listed\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: Not listed\n\nGood Gravy! at Holiday World\n\nGood Gravy! will be the first family coaster at Holiday World.\n\n“The name alone, it's got my heart. Who ever thought I would get to ride a gravy-themed coaster?” Ringas said with a laugh. “The perfect addition to Thanksgiving land.”\n\nThe gravy train “will fly through a giant cranberry jelly can before narrowly avoiding giant kitchen (tools) such as a 20-foot-tall whisk and an 18-foot-tall rolling pin before flying up a 77-foot-tall spike and repeating the journey backward,” according to the park’s website.\n\n◾ Opening: May\n\n◾ Location: Santa Claus, Indiana\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 37 mph\n\n◾ Track length: Nearly 1,500 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: 1 minute, 5 seconds\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: 38 inches to ride with a supervising companion or 48 inches to ride solo.\n\nHot Wheels Twin Mill Racer at Mattel Adventure Park\n\nHot Wheels Twin Mill Racer is one of two Hot Wheels-themed roller coasters coming to the new Mattel Adventure Park in Arizona. The other is Hot Wheels Bone Shaker: The Ultimate Ride, but few details have been released.\n\n“Could there be anything better than a giant Hot Wheels car? I mean, it is shiny. It is beautiful. They had the (coaster) train displayed at the IAPPA Expo and the kid in me just explodes,” Ringas said. The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Expo is where park operators and ride manufacturers show off their latest projects. “They look like they're going to be solid coasters too, and it's a brand new park.”\n\nThe park says Hot Wheels Twin Mill Racer will load indoors “before blasting riders outside, taking them on two vertical loops (one of which tops out at 116 feet) and navigating a series of corkscrew and hairpin turns before making its way back into the building.”\n\n◾ Opening: This year\n\n◾ Location: Glendale, Arizona\n\n◾ Top speed: The website says the coaster will go from 0 to 50 mph in under 3 seconds but does not indicate if that’s the top speed.\n\n◾ Track length: 2,503 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: 65 seconds\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: Not listed\n\nIron Menace at Dorney Park\n\nIron Menace will be the Northeast’s first dive coaster, according to Dorney Park.\n\n“I'm always excited to see when a new dive coaster is coming,” Ringas said. She loves the heart-pounding moment at the top. \"And that’s a great park that really has some treasured rides there. Thunderhawk coaster is celebrating 100 years this year.”\n\nThe park’s website says Iron Menace will “suspend riders 160 feet in the air before plummeting at a beyond-vertical, 95-degree drop” and include “four mind-twisting inversions.”\n\n◾ Opening: May\n\n◾ Location: Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 64 mph\n\n◾ Track length: 2,169 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: 1 minute, 30 seconds\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: Not listed\n\nPhoenix Rising at Busch Gardens-Tampa Bay\n\nPhoenix Rising will be the tenth roller coaster at Busch Gardens-Tampa Bay.\n\n“Inspired by legend, this suspended roller coaster in vibrant Pantopia is packed with surprises and speeds up to 44 miles per hour. But with a height requirement of just 42”, it’s the perfect adventure for families to embark on together!” according to the park’s website.\n\nPhoenix Rising will be an inverted family coaster. Ringas said Vekoma makes a lot of inverted family coasters. “This one is being made by Bolliger & Mabillard, so a lot of coaster enthusiasts are curious to see what it will be like.”\n\n◾ Opening: Spring\n\n◾ Location: Tampa, Florida\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 44 mph\n\n◾ Track length: 1,831 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: Not listed\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: 42 inches\n\nThe Bobcat at Six Flags Great Escape\n\nThe Bobcat will be the first wooden coaster to debut in New York state since 1999 and the first ride of its kind in Six Flags history, according to Six Flags Great Escape, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year.\n\n“We’ve lost so many wooden coasters in the United States that it's nice to see a new one being built from the ground up,” Ringas said. “The great thing about the Gravity Group coasters is they’re a really solid, exhilarating, fun ride.”\n\nThe park says the Bobcat will pair classic charm with modern innovation to create “a more comfortable ride experience, tighter turns along the course, and maximum thrills.”\n\n◾ Opening: Late Spring, Early Summer\n\n◾ Location: Queensbury, New York\n\n◾ Top speed: Nearly 40 mph\n\n◾ Track length: 1,412 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: Not listed\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: 42 inches to ride with a supervising companion or 48 inches to ride solo.\n\nThe Flash: Vertical Velocity at Six Flags Great Adventure\n\nThe Flash: Vertical Velocity will be the first coaster of its kind in North America and only second worldwide, according to Six Flags Great Adventure.\n\nRingas explained the style is a super boomerang by Vekoma. “It is just an extra large version of a boomerang coaster. A boomerang completes the circuit out and back.”\n\nThe park’s website says guests can expect to “experience micro gravity as you run upside down, almost 100 feet off the ground. Zoom through a 180-degree twisted drop followed by a Zero-G roll back to the vertical tower, reaching speeds of up to 59 miles per hour. The train pauses, and then, just like THE FLASH, you change directions on a dime and rush backwards along the track.”\n\n◾ Opening: Summer\n\n◾ Location: Jackson, New Jersey\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 59 mph\n\n◾ Track length: Just over 1,430 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: About 1 minute, 10 seconds\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: 48 inches\n\nTop Thrill 2 at Cedar Point\n\nWith a height of 420 feet and speeds of up to 120 miles per hour, Cedar Point says its new Top Thrill 2 will be “the world’s tallest and fastest triple-launch strata coaster.”\n\nThe ride replaces the park’s previous Top Thrill Dragster. “In the coaster enthusiasts’ world, we consider it a new coaster. It’s getting major trackwork and the track layout is actually changing,” Ringas said. “So while they're using the foundation that was there, it’s getting a major overhaul.”\n\nThe park’s website says guests will “experience true weightlessness as you immerse yourself in three “free-fall” moments, including the coveted, fan-favorite ‘rollback.’ ” A park spokesperson explained that in the previous version of the ride, trains would only roll back when they didn’t have enough inertia to make it over the original tower. Ringas said fans always hoped for a rollback. Now, every ride will include the experience.\n\n◾ Opening: Summer\n\n◾ Location: Sandusky, Ohio\n\n◾ Top speed: Up to 120 mph\n\n◾ Track length: 3,422 feet\n\n◾ Ride duration: About 2 minutes\n\n◾ Minimum height requirement: 52 inches\n\nAre theme park rides safe?What you should know if you're worried about accidents\n\nCircuit Breaker and Palindrome at Circuit of the Americas\n\nCoaster fans are also excited about two new rides coming to the Circuit of the Americas motorsports and entertainment complex in Austin, Texas, but few details have been released.\n\nOne is called Circuit Breaker, which Ringas said will be the first tilt coaster in the U.S.\n\n“A tilt coaster is one of those that you're going to see videos and be like, that can't be real,” she said. “The track literally tilts. The train comes up. The track tilts and reconnects with the back section. That is going to be a heart-stopping, exciting ride.”\n\nThe other will be a shuttle coaster called Palindrome, which Circuit of the Americas says will be the first Gerstlauer infinity coaster of its kind in the U.S.\n\n“You will experience the same track but backwards and forwards, so you'll complete the same circuit twice: go out, come back,” Ringas said, adding that she’s not sure which coaster she’s more excited about. “And I'm in love with the name, the geek in me.

They just opened Emperor last year, so to follow it up with another new coaster this year, it's pretty unbelievable.\"\n\nBig Bear Mountain at Dollywood\n\nOpening: May.\n\nLocation: Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nDescription: With 3,990 feet of track, Big Bear Mountain will be the longest roller coaster at Dollywood and also the park's first featuring onboard audio.\n\nSpeed: Up to 48 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 39 inches.\n\n\"They're promoting it kind of as a family thrill attraction, but (with) the length of the track and what it does, I think it's going to appeal to kids up until thrill seekers,\" Perry said.\n\nHe had a chance to check out the ride cars at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions convention last year and praised their detail and theming. \"It's probably going to end up being my favorite roller coaster at the park.\"\n\n'I Will Always Love You':Dollywood celebrates 50 years of iconic song with star-studded concert series\n\nCatapult Falls at SeaWorld San Antonio\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocation: San Antonio.\n\nDescription: Expect to get wet on the world's steepest and first launched flume coaster, which SeaWorld says will give riders \"the rush of a coaster while experiencing the rocking and swaying of riding on a track of water.\" The ride will also feature \"the only vertical lift in North America,\" rising seven feet per second.\n\nSpeed: Over 37 mph.\n\nMinimum height: Undisclosed.\n\nFlume coasters can be a subject of debate for coaster fans who tally their rides.\n\n\"Is that going to count as a water ride or as a roller coaster or both?\" Perry asked. \"People aren't sure yet, but it looks like it will be awesome to be propelled forward on a water ride. It's definitely unique.\"\n\nDarKoaster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg\n\nOpening: Spring.\n\nLocation: Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nDescription: Boarding snowmobiles to investigate unusual weather patterns near a cursed castle, brave riders may find they're not alone as they race through the dark on North America's first all-indoor straddle coaster, featuring four launches.\n\nSpeed: Unlisted.\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\nDarKoaster will be housed in Busch Garden Williamsburg's Curse of DarKastle building and pay subtle homage to its previous ride, according to the park. All indoor rides can face spatial limitations, but Perry said in DarKoaster, \"You're going to go around the track twice. There's a switch track, and so they're going to change the lighting, and they said it's going to be very different between the first time you go around and the second time you go around to tell the story.\" The ride has over 1,400 feet of track, but that switch will allow riders to experience 2,454 feet of track.\n\nKid Flash Cosmic Coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Fiesta Texas\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocations: Austell, Georgia, and San Antonio.\n\nDescription: Guests can race against each other on dueling twin tracks, which cross over a dozen times \"like a twisted bowl of spaghetti,\" according to Six Flags. The tracks themselves are single-rail.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed, but the park ranks the thrill level as \"mild.\"\n\nMinimum height: 36 inches.\n\n\"Families and friends are going to have a blast racing,\" Perry said, noting the repeat ride-ability with varying outcomes. These will be the first racing coasters in Georgia and Texas, but Perry said their most unique feature will be LED panels lining each track, which can change color. \"This is the first time that anything like this has been created for a roller coaster, and theme park fans are super excited to see this come to life.\"\n\nPipeline: The Surf Coaster at SeaWorld Orlando\n\nOpening: Spring.\n\nLocation: Orlando, Florida.\n\nDescription: Guests can hang much more than 10 on this \"first-of-its-kind\" coaster\" featuring an \"inventive harness that keeps you secure while giving you unparalleled freedom of movement,\" according to SeaWorld Orlando.\n\nSpeed: Up to 60 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 54 inches.\n\n\"Coaster enthusiasts are psyched for Pipeline,\" Perry said \"It's a new ride design that they haven't experienced before ... The ride apparatus actually is going to kind of bounce up and down like you're riding a wave. And this is also the first launched stand-up coaster that has ever been built.\"\n\nHe noted many ride manufacturers seem to have shifted away from building stand-up coasters. \"This hopefully will be super popular, and there will be a resurgence of stand-up coasters.\"\n\nPrimordial at Lagoon\n\nOpening: Undisclosed 2023.\n\nLocation: Farmington, Utah.\n\nDescription: The park says details and images will be released as the ride, now under construction, gets closer to opening.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed.\n\nMinimum height: Undisclosed.\n\n\"They haven't released too many details ... so that's building the anticipation,\" Perry said. \"They built some kind of mountain, so you can see the mountain, and then you see this one section of outdoor track. So coaster enthusiasts are really like, 'What's inside?' \"\n\nTRON Lightcycle / Run at Walt Disney World\n\nOpening: April 4.\n\nLocation: Near Orlando, Florida.\n\nDescription: TRON Lightcycle / Run invites guests to enter the Grid and race against personified computer Programs in futuristic Lightcycle vehicles, just like in the \"Tron\" and \"Tron: Legacy\" films and TRON arcade game.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed but Disney calls it \"one of the fastest coasters at any Disney theme park.\"\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\n\"Coaster enthusiasts who have been riding it have just been blown away,\" Perry said. \"They love the whole look, the futuristic look of everything, how it's all weaved together with music from Daft Punk from the movie and pulling in the different futuristic themes. There are so many things to look at on the ride, you want to go on it definitely multiple times if possible.\"\n\nWhile the ride officially opens to the public next month, it's been open for cast members, annual pass members, and other special previews for a few weeks. When Perry got to ride it, he said he got chills.\n\n\"With TRON Lightcycle / Run, you are merged in that video game, like you're on the Grid. You were digitized and you're part of it, and it doesn't seem like you're in Florida anymore,\" he said. \"It's almost like being in a dream or something.\"\n\nDoes Disney have military discounts?:Yes, and so do these popular theme parks\n\nWild Mouse at Cedar Point\n\nOpening: May.\n\nLocation: Sandusky, Ohio.\n\nDescription: Guests chase after cheese in six mouse-themed cars and one cheese-themed car on this all-new coaster, which throws back to Cedar Point's original Wild Mouse ride. Because the number of riders in each car can change how it spins now, the park says \"no two rides will be the same.\"\n\nSpeed: 35 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 42 inches with a supervising companion or 48 inches solo.\n\n\"It's going to be a great family addition to the park,\" Perry said.\n\nCedar Point is known for its coasters, and Wild Mouse will be its 18th. \"There are all these roller coasters that go over 200, 300 feet tall,\" he said. \"This is an awesome addition where the people who don't want to go that high can still enjoy the roller coaster.\"\n\nWildcat's Revenge at Hersheypark\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocation: Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\nDescription: This new steel and wood hybrid roller coaster plunges riders down an 82-degree drop and features four inversions and the \"world's largest underflip.\"\n\nSpeed: Up to 62 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\n\"Some coaster enthusiasts were definitely upset that (its predecessor) Wildcat was closing, this traditional wooden coaster,\" Perry said. But the new ride incorporates several nods to the original.\n\n\"They took some of the wooden structure and then (add) the all-steel track,\" he said. \"The ride got a little rough in later years, so this is perfect.\"\n\nHe also complimented the train car design. \"There's a wildcat coming out of the front of the train, so it's going to be eye-catching. And then it's the world's largest underflip, the inversion spin that they're going for,\" he said. \"People can't wait.\"\n\nZambezi Zinger at Worlds of Fun\n\nOpening: Undisclosed 2023.\n\nLocation: Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nDescription: The tallest point on this new hybrid wood and steel coaster stands 17 feet higher than the park's original Zinger. Zambezi Zinger also features a new African safari theme and side-by-side seating, instead of toboggan-style seats.\n\nSpeed: 45 mph.\n\nMinimum height: Unlisted.\n\n\"They're going to use some of the elements from the old coaster like a spiral lift hill and some tunnels and stuff,\" Perry said, which he added makes fans wonder, \"'What is this going to be like, how close to the old coaster is this going to be, and what are they going to bring to it?' \"\n\nEve Chen is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Georgia.

Here's what stood ...", "text": "As I took a bite of cinnamon bread outside of the Grist Mill at Dollywood on Thursday, I couldn’t help thinking: I’ve made it.\n\nI grew up in Nashville and have wanted to visit Dolly Parton’s Tennessee theme park for years, but the timing never worked out – though billboards reading “The Great Smokies are calling” made me consider an impromptu road trip more than once.\n\nI finally took the three-and-a-half hour drive this week for the opening of its new Big Bear Mountain roller coaster and spent a day exploring. Here’s what stood out to me as a first-time visitor and what other newbies like me should keep in mind:\n\nHello Dolly!:Dollywood theme park will keep you (and your kids) entertained 9 to 5\n\nMeet Derek and Doug PerryThese twins have ridden over 1,100 roller coasters\n\nThe theme park is manageable\n\nIn the leadup to my visit, I tried to sketch a rough mental game plan. I consulted USA TODAY’s resident theme park expert, Eve Chen, who accompanied me on the trip and texted a friend who said he has been to Dollywood probably 75 times, asking for his recommendations. I figured I wouldn’t be able to get to all of them, but they at least gave me a starting point.\n\nBut when I got to the park, I was surprised by how manageable it felt. We began our day at the family-friendly area Wildwood Grove and traversed the park’s central loop more than once during our less than six-hour visit.\n\nAfter the first time around, I felt I had my bearings. The setup allowed us to wander freely, hopping on roller coasters like the Tennessee Tornado and stopping in shops as we went. Unlike at some other theme parks I've visited, I didn’t worry about getting lost.\n\nAided by TimeSaver passes, we moved through rides at a good clip – though the crowds appeared to be modest as we visited on a weekday, and we did not even attempt to visit Dollywood's Splash Country water park.\n\nWhile I didn’t make it to every attraction my friend suggested – the theme park would likely take a couple of days to conquer in earnest – I made a dent.\n\nThe park uses the mountains as an attraction\n\nDollywood has plenty of rides, but the scenery is its own attraction. Located in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains in Pigeon Forge, the park capitalizes on a cozy, cabin-in-the-woods feel – wood structures abound and I saw at least two kinds of black bear Christmas ornaments for sale. Roller coasters like the 21-story high Wild Eagle, meanwhile, offer sweeping views of the treetops.\n\nGranted, I only saw those for the brief intermittent moments when I opened my eyes – I’m not a big fan of heights – but they were worth it.\n\nDolly Parton is everywhere\n\nWhile I expected Parton to feature prominently in my day at Dollywood, her story was woven through the experience in strikingly personal ways. “In some ways, going through Dollywood is like a tour through my life, and I hope that it inspires and helps everyone who visits with their own dreams,” the legendary entertainer said in a pamphlet available at the entrance.\n\nDollywood's Splash Country:What's new as the weather heats up\n\nWhat's banned at Disney World?:What guests should know before visiting\n\nThat was evident all around. While eating lunch outside in the park, I could hear Parton’s voice over a speaker telling the story behind her song “Coat of Many Colors,” about a coat her mother made for her from fabric scraps. And in between rides, we stopped by Dolly’s Tennessee Mountain Home, a replica of the house where she grew up.\n\nThe replica was built by Parton’s brother, Bobby, and her mother, Avie Lee, reproduced the inside, where Dollywood visitors can see “original family treasures,” according to a plaque outside.\n\nI left the park not only having had several thrills – and both too much and somehow not enough cinnamon bread – but also the impression that I had gotten a glimpse inside Parton’s world.\n\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

Last year, they rode every new coaster that opened across the U.S. and hope to do the same this year.\n\n\"I know, it's an obsession,\" Derek laughed. \"People think, 'What's wrong with you?' But it makes me so happy.\" And they aren't alone.\n\n'A really exciting time':12 of the most anticipated new roller coasters opening in 2023\n\nAre theme park rides safe?What you should know if you're worried about accidents\n\nEarly memories\n\n\"I remember one time being a kid, there was an amusement park book, and our mom would read us pages from it like as a bedtime story,\" Derek said with a smile. He still loves park statistics. \"We just retained all this information.\"\n\n\"Then I remember I was talking to my mom one day about EPCOT and the different countries that have (pavilions), and she was like, 'If you focused this much on your school work, you'd be getting straight A's,' \" he added. \"But my passion was theme parks.\"\n\nTurning point\n\nThe brothers vividly recall their first \"big rides\" at around age 10. They were at Six Flags Great Adventure, the first stop of theme park road trip, which also included Hershey Park, Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Williamsburg.\n\n\"We're looking at these big rollercoasters, and we're thinking, 'We don't want to go on, and we're too scared to go on.' Do you remember?\" Derek said, turning to Doug, who immediately agreed. \"And our parents said, 'Well, if you're not going to ride the big rides, we can just go to museums for the rest of the trip.' \"\n\n\"They're not going to spend all this money going to these theme parks,\" Doug chimed in. Even back then, tickets weren't cheap, but nowadays, the starting price for daily park admission ranges from $39.99 at Kings Dominion, with its Early Days Deal, to $109 at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\n\"And we're kids,\" Doug said. \"We don't want to spend our summer vacation in museums, so that forced us on the rides. And as soon as we did go on the big rides, we fell in love.\"\n\nBeing a kid again\n\n\"When you're on a coaster, for me, I'm not thinking about anything else. All my cares from the world, from the day, they go away, and I'm just living in the moment, which is hard to do nowadays,\" Derek said. \"For theme parks, same thing. It reminds me of being a kid and just being blissful and happy.\"\n\n\"I feel exactly the same way, and I just love that fake fantasy world and just the themes,\" Doug chuckled. \"It's an escape.\"\n\nDream jobs\n\nWhen the brothers were 16, they got jobs at Rocky Point Park, a Rhode Island amusement park that opened in the 1840s and shuttered in the 1990s.\n\n\"We just loved being in the park and you know, we would do anything,\" Derek said. The jobs included operating games and giving guests temporary tattoos. \"And we would ride as much as possible, even if we weren't supposed to.\"\n\nHe said one rainy day with low attendance, they rode the Corkscrew roller coaster, their first upside-down roller coaster, over 30 times in a row. \"Surprisingly, we didn't get sick,\" he said. \"We just had the time of our lives.\"\n\nThey began traveling on their own for coasters in college and got really into it after moving from Rhode Island to California.\n\nReal jobs\n\nNowadays, Derek and Doug are DJs and music producers. \"I'm thinking about music and coasters all the time,\" Derek said. Whenever they travel to new cities for gigs, they try to ride roller coasters nearby.\n\nThey'd hoped to ride Dr. Diabolical’s Cliffhanger, which is billed as the \"world's steepest dive coaster,\" when they DJed at Six Flags Fiesta Texas' Pride event last June, but it wasn't open yet.\n\n\"We did go back,\" Derek laughed. \"It was the end of October, and Doug was like, 'You know we've been on pretty much every new roller coaster that opened this year. We haven't been on Dr. Diabolical. It's a shame we can't get on it.' So for our birthday, we planned a trip to go ride Dr. Diabolical.\" They did wind up riding every new coaster in the U.S. last year, making special trips for most of them.\n\nPark tipsHow can I get the most out of my Disneyland trip? Pro tips from insiders who know it best\n\n'A big crazy adventure':Teen who biked from Alaska to Argentina is backpacking his way home\n\nCounting coasters\n\nDerek has now ridden more than 1,200 roller coasters. Doug has ridden over 1,100.\n\n\"For Derek, there's no coaster too small. He will travel – and we have – hours and hours out of our way for some kiddie coaster that's considered a (coaster) credit because he counts all his coasters,\" Doug said with a laugh.\n\n\"If I fit, I sit; like a cat in a box,\" Derek laughed. \"If I'm going to a kiddie coaster in South Dakota and I've never been to South Dakota, it forces me to go out and see this area of the country I haven't been to.\"\n\nSome roller coasters are the destination. Others are detours.\n\nCoaster community\n\nThe brothers aren't the only ones willing to go the distance. American Coaster Enthusiasts describes itself as the \"world's largest club of amusement ride enthusiasts,\" and many members are willing to travel for their shared love.\n\nDerek serves as the group's communications director. Doug joked that he's Derek's assistant, but he really helps with ACE's social media and other areas. \"It's like a full-time job, but it's all volunteer,\" he said.\n\nDerek and Doug have met some of their closest friends through ACE events, which include exclusive ride times on attractions before or after theme parks open to the public.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true being at a park when there aren't lines, and you can just sit on a roller coaster and go on it over and over and over and try all the different seats,\" Derek said, joking that their early Rocky Point days prepared them for that.\n\nFavorite roller coasters\n\nDerek says his favorite roller coaster is \"always the roller coaster that I'm currently riding,\" but noted appreciation for traditional coasters like Leap-the-Dips, which Lakemont Park bills as the \"oldest wooden roller coaster in the world,\" and newer ones like VelociCoaster at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\n\"Maybe Derek's are off the record,\" Doug laughed. \"I have so many.\" Doug's favorites include Superman at Six Flags New England, Iron Gwazi at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, X2 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland just outside Toronto.\n\n\"For me, Hershey Park has the best collection of roller coasters, and now they're getting a new roller coaster this year,\" he added. \"Busch Gardens Williamsburg is my favorite park overall. I have so many memories there.\"\n\nDoes Disney have military discounts?Yes, and so do these popular theme parks\n\nWhat's new at Dollywood:Big Bear Mountain coaster and much more\n\nMaking the most of it\n\n\"Unfortunately, our parents don't travel with us anymore because our dad had a stroke a few years ago,\" Doug said. The summer before the stroke, they got in one last big road trip all together with visits to Six Flags St. Louis, Silver Dollar City and Hershey Park.\n\n\"After our dad had his stroke, for me, it's kind of like I don't want to miss any opportunity because I never know when I won't be able to do something,\" Derek said. \"So even though I might not want to travel those two hours to go to that little coaster or get up at four in the morning and go to a roller coaster, I just do it because I know I'm going to make such good memories.\"\n\nNow the brothers FaceTime or call their parents from parks. \"It's like they're there as much as they can be, but it brings back like all the memories of being a kid,\" Derek said. \"But yeah, our mom loves roller coasters, and I feel like she lives vicariously now, through what we're doing.\"\n\nAnd \"we do have our coaster enthusiast friends now to go on these big epic trips with,\" Doug added.\n\nRoller coaster tips", "authors": [],

lawsuit:Cedar Point, Kings Island and other Cedar Fair parks might have to pay refunds for 2020\n\nMuch of Cedar Point's focus and energy this offseason has been on major upgrades to its two off-property resorts, not coasters and the park's famed midway.\n\nThe park's Sawmill Creek and the Castaway Bay resorts will debut with newly renovated rooms and restaurants along with refurbished pools and amenities.\n\nInside the gates, there are some changes and things you should know to make your visit a memorable one at \"America's Roller Coast\" this summer.\n\nLeave your cash at home when heading to Cedar Point\n\nYou can pay cash to park at Cedar Point, but that's about all you can use currency for.\n\nThe park and its surrounding properties will be cashless this summer.\n\nThis means you will need to pay for everything from a corn dog to the hoops challenge to a Snoopy stuffed animal with a debit or credit card.\n\nThose guests who just bring cash to the park will be able to

Farmhouse Kitchen & Grill.\n\nThe menu will include roasted corn ribs, house-made chili, char-roasted flank steak with chimichurri, roasted seasonal vegetables, hushpuppies and cast iron brownie a-la-mode.\n\nA stage has been added with musical acts planned to entertain diners.\n\nOn the main midway, a new eatery called Derby Dogs by the Cedar Downs Racing Derby ride will feature jumbo or footlong all-beef hot dogs along with mini hot dogs and Italian sausage sandwiches.\n\nWhat's new?:Sorry, Cedar Point fans, no new thrill rides this year as park invests in resorts and food\n\nToppings include the usual and unusual, like bacon, chili, sauerkraut, avocado halves, cole slaw, jalapenos, tomatoes and shredded cheeses.\n\nThe park's Coasters Drive-In, also on the main midway, has received a makeover designed to improve speed of service and has offerings that will include rotating sandwiches and salads.\n\nSmaller roller coaster lineup at Cedar Point in 2022\n\nCedar Point's number of roller coasters will be smaller this summer.\n\nThe Top Thrill Dragster that dominates the midway will remain closed for the season after an accident last season.\n\nThe ride closed last summer after a part from one of its coaster trains became dislodged and struck a customer waiting line.\n\nTop Thrill Dragster investigation:Cedar Point had no knowledge Top Thrill Dragster 'was in an unsafe condition,' state says\n\nA woman from Michigan suffered a severe head injury when the part struck her.\n\nDuring the offseason, Cedar Point removed its Wicked Twister roller coaster.\n\nThe park has not announced plans for the prime real estate now opened up along its beach.\n\nThis will likely mean longer lines and waits to ride the park's remaining

large climbing area.\n\nParade returns at Cedar Point in 2022\n\nThe parade that celebrated the park's 150th anniversary is back.\n\nWell, not exactly.\n\nIt has been renamed and rethemed to the Celebrate Cedar Point Parade & Spectacular.\n\nThe parade will kick off nightly at 7 p.m. starting June 24 and will run through Aug. 14 along the main midway.\n\nIt will include 12 large floats that mark moments and eras in the park's history.\n\nPerformers and park mascots will perform and interact with guests along the parade route.\n\nThe parade will conclude at the park's Celebration Plaza,

Here’s what we found out about the Corkscrew and other Rocky Point rides:\n\nWhat happened to the Corkscrew when Rocky Point closed?\n\nLet’s start with the Corkscrew, arguably the most recognizable Rocky Point ride.\n\nInnovative when it was first installed in 1984, it featured one 360-degree loop and two twists of the track that resembled corkscrews.\n\nIt was the first of its kind in New England when it was installed, and the first riders described it to The Providence Journal as feeling like “getting tossed around in a clothes dryer,” “strapped on a giant runaway roller skate” or “riding a simulated space capsule at NASA headquarters.”\n\nPhotos:Remembering RI's amusement park Rocky Point: What was your favorite attraction?\n\nWhen the park closed, the Corkscrew was in high demand. First, it was bought at auction by Blue Bayou Water Park in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for $805,000, according to archives. But that sale fell through, and it went to Enchanted Parks in Federal Way, Washington.\n\nToday, Enchanted Parks is known as Wild Waves Theme and Waterpark, and the Corkscrew – which features a different paint job – is still one of the main high-thrill rides.\n\n“We are thrilled to let you know that this awesome roller coaster is still a favorite among our guests at Wild Waves Theme & Water Park,” said Pam Bugbee, the director of sales and marketing at Wild Waves in an email. “The park opens for the season on May 18th, and your reader will be happy to know that The Wild Thing will be operational throughout the entire season.”\n\nShe added, “rest assured, we are taking care of The Wild Thing for all our guests to enjoy.\"\n\nWhat about the other Rocky Point rides?\n\nA good number of the other rides are still in operation, according to former Providence Journal employee George LaCross, who runs an amusement park blog and is an administrator of the Facebook Group Rocky Point Park Remembered!\n\nThe other rides in operation are, according to LaCross:\n\nCyclone Coaster: It was \"purchased at the April 1996 auction by Sandspit Cavendish Beach in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island, Canada.”\n\nEnterprise: Now known as the Flyin’ Tiger, it’s at Dixie Landin’ in Baton Rouge.\n\nFlume: This one traveled quite far from Rhode Island, as it was purchased by Enchanted Kingdom in the Philippines, \"where various components were installed in its Jungle Log Jam flume ride.”\n\nThe grand carousel: By contrast, this one is much closer, at Atlantic Beach Park in Westerly, “where it operates, minus the Rocky Point horses. Atlantic Beach uses other horses, mostly from its former vintage Illions Carousel.”\n\nWhat and Why RI is a weekly feature by The Providence Journal to explore our readers' curiosity.

Here are 7 things ...", "text": "With summer just weeks away, it's time to think about relaxing days on Iowa's Great Lakes.\n\nOkoboji, in northwest Iowa, is a favorite summer gathering spot for Iowans. Here are seven ways to enjoy a week or weekend in and around the clear, cool water.\n\nVisit Arnolds Park\n\nNothing is more classic than Arnolds Park and its boardwalk. An old-school amusement park on the lakeshore, it has entertained and enchanted generations of Iowans since it opened on West Okoboji Lake in 1889.\n\nThe park features a boardwalk on the lake with ice cream shops, restaurants and places to buy Okoboji-branded souvenirs. But the centerpiece is The Legend roller coaster. Built in 1930, the genuine wood-framed coaster features a figure-eight layout that covers 2,000 feet of track in one minute. A six-year restoration was completed in 2023, with a new paint job, new concrete and a refurbishment of the first section of the track.\n\nThe Legend may be old, but it's mightier than ever. It still has the bumps typical of wooden coasters, but they're gentler than before and the ride is more enjoyable.\n\nCatch a concert\n\nNext to Arnolds Park is Preservation Plaza. Unveiled last year, the plaza features a stage with a unique, wavy roof. A concert deck on the plaza has an outdoor bar and the upstairs portion of the deck is available for rental by sponsors and donors during summer concerts.\n\nFor music lovers, the Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is just steps away.\n\nThe 2024 concert lineup at Preservation Plaza includes:\n\nREO Speedwagon June 14.\n\nChase McDaniel June 15.\n\nScotty McCreery June 28.\n\nThree Dog Night & Little River Band July 21.\n\nCole Swindell July 26.\n\nRussell Dickerson Aug. 16.\n\nHang out at Miller's Bay\n\nA short cruise or paddle from Gull Point State Park, Miller's Bay in West Okoboji Lake is a popular hangout for boaters. On hot days and on busy weekends thousands of people will cram into the small bay. It can feel claustrophobic sometimes, but it's a fun place to drop anchor, have a cold one and relax in the sun.\n\nStop at The Barefoot bar\n\nAmong the most popular stops on the lake for boaters is The Barefoot Bar on East Okoboji Lake, with its tropical-themed drinks and slushies. Its restaurant has pizza, burgers, tacos and other things that are easy to eat on a boat or on the go.\n\nMost of all, Barefoot is known for its Full Moon Parties starting at 7 p.m. on nights with full moons in the summer.\n\nThis year's Full Moon Parties will be held May 23, June 21, July 21 and Aug. 19.\n\nRide a bike\n\nIowa is the home of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa and a fast-growing network of trails, so it should be no surprise that Okoboji is bike friendly. The 14-mile Iowa Great Lakes Trail winds its way through Milford, Okoboji and Spirit Lake, with spurs leading to other lakeside attractions.\n\nThe system loops around Big Spirit Lake, where it links across the border to the Loon Lake Trail in Minnesota's Loon Lake Park, adding even more mileage for those seeking a longer, scenic ride.\n\nWatch fireworks\n\nThere's nothing quite like watching fireworks over West Okoboji Lake. From the end of May through the end of August there are firework displays on most Friday nights and a handful of other nights throughout the summer. Fireworks shows typically begin after Preservation Plaza concerts around 10:15 p.m.\n\nIn 2024 fireworks displays will be held:\n\nMay 25.\n\nJune 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29.\n\nJuly 4, 6, 13,20 and 27.\n\nAug. 3, 10, 17, 24 and 31.\n\nHave a Charlie Boy\n\nAll northwest Iowans know the Charlie Boy, a Sioux City specialty. It's also the signature dish at the Okoboji affiliate of a Sioux City landmark, the Miles Inn, the perfect place to hang out when you're taking a break from the lake.\n\nCharlie Boys are like Maid Rites, but better. Wrapped in wax paper, they're loose meat sandwiches with cheese, onions, mustard and ketchup. The meat has extra pepper in it to give it a kick.\n\nCharlie Boys always hit the spot. The trick is not eating more than three at a time.\n\nPhilip Joens covers retail, real estate and RAGBRAI for the Des Moines Register.

Around the country, people gather to watch others consume absurd amounts of food in record times, sometimes for a cash prize, and sometimes just because. Competitors' seemingly super-human abilities often can cause us to stare, if not feel a little queasy — and even, in some extreme cases, potentially convince us to join in the action.\n\nWe've compiled and ranked a list of some of the strangest food competitions across the country. From the legendary Nathan's Famous Hot-Dog-Eating Contest every Fourth of July to small local festivals, these contests gather a crowd.\n\nSome competitions are about celebrating culinary traditions, like the Stuffed Quahog-Eating Contest. Other contests are purely about quantity, like the Nugget Rib Cook-Off World Rib-Eating Championship. Lastly, some competitions, including the Testicle Festival in Montana, are essentially for the spectacle.\n\nSome driven eaters like the famous Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, are known throughout the competitive eating world and hold multiple competition titles. Other participants range in background and motivation, but deserve no less attention for wanting to gorge themselves on as much food as possible.\n\nTo make our list of the craziest food competitions, events have to be held annually (including this year) and cannot be performed at a restaurant (sorry, monster burrito challenges). They were then ranked based on the popularity of the given food (assuming that most folks are more likely to eat hot dogs than they are testicles), the type and amount (if any) of reward, and whether or not they have any special rules.\n\n10. Oktoberfest Zinzinnati World Bratwurst-Eating Championship — Ohio\n\nTaking place at America's largest Oktoberfest, this competition has a cash prize of around $2,000. The festival occurs in September and contestants try to eat as many bratwursts as they can in 10 minutes. The winner in 2012 (and the seven-time winner of the Nathan's Hot-Dog-Eating Contest) was Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, with 37 bratwursts (short of his world record of 42).\n\n9. Acme Oyster Eating World Championship — Louisiana\n\nThe New Orleans Oyster Festival celebrates the delicious oysters served throughout the city at various restaurants. A highlight of the festival is the Oyster-Eating Contest, sponsored by Acme Oyster House. Contenders are required to use forks (they are not allowed to lift the oyster and slurp it down) and all oysters must be cleared from their tray before starting another one. In 2010, Sonya \"The Black Widow\" Thomas won the competition with a record 47 dozen oysters in just eight minutes. This year, Thomas took the top prize again, albeit with only 24 dozen oysters.\n\n8. The Day-Lee Foods World Gyoza Eating Championship — California\n\nWhen dumplings taste this good, why stop after just 200? This competition takes place at the Nisei Week Foundation Festival in Los Angeles, and the cash prizes add up to $6,000. Last year's winner was Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut, who ate a record 266 dumplings in 10 minutes.\n\n7. World's Grits Festival — South Carolina\n\nIn the small town of St. George, S.C., participants gather to celebrate a Southern favorite at the World Grits Festival. The festival has two grits competitions: rolling in the grits (participants roll in a pool of grits and attempt to cover themselves completely in the food) and a grits-eating competition, in which competitors race to finish their bowl the fastest.\n\n6. Cheese Curd Festival — Wisconsin\n\nThe cheese state celebrates its love for cheese curds at the annual Cheese Curd Festival. The festival is filled with various activities, but the day wouldn't be complete without a cheese-curd-eating competition. The competition has a variety of age categories, from 7 and under to 16 and up. The winners in each category receive a trophy, $10, and, of course, bragging rights.\n\n5. The Stockton Asparagus Festival — California\n\nThis festival celebrates the vegetable and raises money for local charities. One of the activities at the celebratory festival is the eating contest, in which participants eat deep-fried asparagus. This year, Matthew \"The Megatoad\" Stonie beat out Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut by eating 9.5 pounds of the deep-fried vegetable.\n\n4. Stuffed Quahog Eating Contest — Massachusetts\n\nCompetitors gather at the Stuffed Quahog-Eating Contest to consume as many stuffed quahogs in 90 seconds as their body will allow. The quahog is another name for a hard-shelled clam, which is particularly abundant between Cape Cod and New Jersey. Last year's winner was Rich Rogers, who consumed seven stuffed quahogs in 90 seconds.\n\n3. World Kimichi Eating Championship — Illinois\n\nHeld in Chicago at the Korean Festival, the Kimchi-Eating Championship features the national dish of Korea, kimchi. The dish is made of spiced vegetables, mainly napa cabbage, radishes, cucumbers, and scallions, and is known for its health benefits. The contest is to see who can eat the most in eight minutes.\n\n2. World Slugburger Eating Championship — Mississippi\n\nThis contest features a local favorite, the Slugburger, a burger made of a mixture of beef and breading that's then deep-fried instead of grilled. The standard garnish is a pickle, onion, and mustard, and the winner can receive up to $3,000. In 2012, the winner was Matt \"The Megatoad\" Stonie, who consumed 30 burgers in 10 minutes.\n\n1. Annual Testicle Festival — Montana\n\nThis unique festival is held annually in Clinton, Mont., and features a variety of contests, including a wet T-shirt contest. But the strangest (and most disgusting) of the competitions is the Ball-Eating Contest. The food of choice is deep-fried bull's testicles (available in different varieties), which the festival is dedicated to.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2018/07/24/competitive-eating-goes-way-beyond-hot-dogs/794946002/", "title": "Tacos, gyoza, pork roll: Competitive eating goes way beyond hot dogs", "text": "If there were trading cards for the best-known competitive eaters, Joey Chestnut would be the most coveted. With Forbes estimating his net worth at $800,000, he's far ahead of his peers, and one of the few who earn enough to make his passion his day job.\n\nChestnut is one of the walking appetites you see scarfing dozens of Nathan's Famous hot dogs on the Fourth of July. The Coney Island showdown is the all-star game of the competitive eating world, awarding $10,000 to the champions. More commonly, a contest's total purse will be $4,000 to cover first- through fifth-place winners.\n\nA new American pastime\n\nIf you think you're hearing more about these contests lately, you're right. An increasing number of state fairs, minor league baseball teams, restaurants and private businesses are drawing crowds by celebrating local favorite foods like oysters, cheese curds, Buffalo wings, tamales, moonpies and — here in New Jersey, of course — pork roll. A typical event is the Peel & Eat Shrimp Eating Contest, part of the Meadowlands' Food Truck Seafood Festival held Saturday, July 28 at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford.\n\n\"Our calendar mirrors the fair and festival circuit,\" says George Shea, co-founder of Major League Eating, the organization that sanctions, publicizes and often produces TV coverage of the country's major eating events. \"It picks up in spring, peaks in summer and slows down after fall.\"\n\nShea started his firm with brother, Richard, and another partner in 1997, and promoted the hot dog eating contest with the goal of generating free media for their client, Nathan's Famous.\n\n\"There've always been apple pie eating contests somewhere, and there's the [Travel Channel's] Man v. Food show, but we popularized this,\" Shea says. \"The ESPN show [broadcast on July 4] gets millions of viewers and leads to billions of consumer impressions.\"\n\nThe company handled 55 to 60 competitions last year, often after brand or festival organizers approached Major League Eating for their services, he says.\n\nDrawing crowds with pork roll\n\nThat's the way the Trenton Thunder World Famous Case's Pork Roll Eating Contest, now in its fourth year, came to be. \"We wanted to do some kind of kickoff to the season, and thought of an eating competition,\" says Jeff Hurley, general manager and chief operating officer of the New York Yankees Double-A affiliate.\n\n\"It's up close and personal watching those guys eat, and seeing the look on their faces. I've been hungry and eaten my fair share, but I don't think I could ever put down that amount and walk out.\"\n\nHurley acknowledges that pork roll is a regional food item, found mostly in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, and that reigning competitive eating leader Joey Chestnut had never tried it until a day before the contest. The champ downed a record 43 Case's Pork Roll sandwiches in 10 minutes in 2016, though in his absence last year, native son and The College of New Jersey grad Carmen Cincotti took the title by eating 40.\n\nDarron Breeden, 29, finished second in the 2017 pork roll challenge, with 33 quarter-pound sandwiches consumed — not bad for a rookie. The Orange, Va. native and high school teacher was drawn to competitive eating a few years ago while living in Japan.\n\n\"I tried a Man v. Food challenge where you eat five pounds of curry rice, and got the meal for free,\" he says. He eventually signed an online contract with Major League Eating so he could be guaranteed spots at events with similarly serious eaters. After coming in fifth at last year's Nathan's Famous contest, he decided to train earlier and harder.\n\nWhat it takes\n\n\"In January, I started practicing to see how many hot dogs I could eat in 10 minutes, and recording the sessions,\" Breeden says. He upped the frequency until April, when he started holding a personal contest every week.\n\n\"The smallest details count,\" he say. \"I had a lot of inefficient movements, like when I would get distracted and have nothing in my hands. I could have squeezed in an extra five hot dogs.\" This year he ate 43 and came in third behind Joey Chestnut and Carmen Cincotti.\n\nPracticing, he says, also helps him get used to foods that are harder to binge on, like kale, which is dry, and pork roll, which is thick.\n\nWhen training, Breeden watches what he eats — not just for a balanced diet, but to keep his stomach stretched out. \"I might have four-to-six pounds of lettuce, plain chicken, cabbage, and on top of that, drink a gallon of water with an electrolyte mix squeezed in,\" he says.\n\nAnd yes, his diet does affect his personal life. \"Friends will say, 'Let's go out to the Cheesecake Factory,' and I have to say 'Sorry, guys, I have to keep up on training,'\" he says.\n\nMore:New Jersey, meet the state's preeminent hot dog expert\n\nMore:NJ hot dogs: These are the best hot dogs in NJ\n\nMore:What we'll be eating in 2018: food trends for the year ahead\n\nRisky business\n\nAs you might expect, there are more serious hazards of the trade, too. A 2007 study entitled \"Competitive Speed Eating: Truth and Consequences,\" published in the American Journal ofRoentgenology, concluded that \"Professional speed eaters eventually may develop morbid obesity, profound gastroparesis, intractable nausea and vomiting and even the need for a gastrectomy.\"\n\nShea says that competitive eaters shouldn't punish their innards by training, adding that \"There's no arms race to 100 [hot dogs].\"\n\nSouth Korean-born Sonya Thomas, 51, nicknamed \"The Black Widow\" for her ability to vanquish male competitors twice her size, is said to owe her competitive edge in part to her slight build, which allows her stomach to expand more easily, since it isn't surrounded by a ring of fat. (She also says that she eats modest amounts of veggies and fresh fruit, avoids junk food and works out regularly.)\n\n\"I don't like to lose,\" she told the Reuters news agency. \"That's my personality...If I lose, I feel terrible.\"\n\nNot going for the win\n\nNot all competitors are in it for the potential thrill of victory. Dr. Rene Rovtar, 59, a Basking Ridge resident and Montville Superintendent of Schools, watched a woman at the Nathan's Famous contest eat \"four hot dogs as if she were at a backyard barbecue,\" and told her family \"I could do this!\" She persuaded her daughter Kristina, 30, to join her, and this year, they competed together.\n\n\"We didn't train like the heavy hitters,\" Rovtar says. \"We just had a small dinner the night before, didn't eat anything that day, and tried to stay hydrated because it was so humid.\"\n\nRovtar polished off six and a half hot dogs and Kristina ate five, which placed them near the bottom of the list, but they got what they came for: fun.\n\n\"We're the best of friends, and we love doing things together,\" she says. \"The other part is that people who are involved in competitive eating are some of the friendliest and warmest people I've ever met. You make new friends. They're just fun to be around.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/30/competitive-eating-how-do-they-do-it/437541001/", "title": "Joey Chestnut, Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest: How do ...", "text": "On the 241st anniversary of his country's independence, American Joey Chestnut ate 72 hot dogs in 10 minutes. A new record.\n\n\"Jaws,\" as Chestnut is known, put down a summer's worth of cased meats at the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Tuesday. It was an impressive physical accomplishment and a gargantuan intake of calories, fat and salt.\n\nThe competition, which started in 1916, is a true gut-buster.\n\nTo stuff in that much meat and bun, competitors train their stomachs to expand, ruin their ability to feel full and risk long-term damage to their digestive systems.\n\nHow do they fit so much in?\n\nThe normal human stomach is about the size of a Nerf football, said Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist David Fleischer. At its biggest, it stretches about 15%.\n\nOn the other hand, competitive eaters can expand their stomachs two to three times their normal size.\n\nNobody knows for sure why people such as Chestnut and 2015 Nathan's champion Matt \"The Megatoad\" Stonie can pull this off, said Fleischer, who said he's a longtime Nathan's hot dog lover. Ivy League researchers suspect it's because competitive eaters train themselves to overcome the natural bodily triggers that tell us we're full.\n\nA 2007 University of Pennsylvania study of one competitive eater found he changed his physiology to make himself an eating machine.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Roentgenology, found the competitive eater's stomach expanded so \"it could accept an almost unlimited volume of food.\"\n\n\"He was able to overcome the usual checks and balances associated with eating by exercising extraordinary willpower and self-discipline during his training, consuming more and more food when others wouldn't be able to swallow another bite without feeling sick,\" the study said.\n\nRead more:\n\nJoey Chestnut regains hot dog eating title, sets record\n\nInside the disturbing dangers of competitive eating\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Contest ensures its future as Fourth of July tradition with new ESPN deal\n\nIs there a 'grand expulsion'?\n\nNot much has been written on what happens behind the bathroom door after an eating competition. It's best not to imagine it.\n\nBut gastroenterologist J. Sumner Bell suspects the process could take a long time.\n\n\"I don't know if there is a grand expulsion of this or not,\" said Bell, an expert for the American Gastroenterological Association. \"If they don't self-induce vomiting, it may take a long time for it to be emptied from the stomach.\"\n\nAfter eating, a normal person's stomach will return to its regular size in about an hour or two. The food exits the stomach into the small intestine to be absorbed for nutrients, then the colon and, well, you know the rest.\n\nIn a typical case, it takes somewhere between four and 24 hours for food to move from the stomach to a bowel movement.\n\nIngesting that much sodium could produce a lot of gas or diarrhea, Bell said. Electrolyte abnormalities caused by the gorge-fest could cause heart irregularities.\n\nWhy no weight gain?\n\nYet competitive eaters aren't the biggest among us. Chestnut, 33, is 6-foot-1 and 230 pounds while Stonie, 25, is just 5-foot-8 and 130 pounds.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason is because most of the calories competitive eaters take in aren't absorbed by the body.\n\nThe small intestine recognizes when it doesn't need nutrients, Fleischer said. In the case of a big eating competition, most of the food, he said, exits the small intestine and is not absorbed.\n\nIn the University of Pennsylvania study, the competitive eater admitted he could no longer feel full and only stayed trim because he monitored how much he ate.\n\nRead more\n\n100 beers in 45 minutes?

The same goes for the esophagus, Bell said\n\nVoracious eating also could cause choking.\n\nDespite the MLE's warnings, both Chestnut and Stonie admit to training. Stonie said he ate 60 hot dogs three days a week and would sometimes drink a gallon of water afterward to prepare for the hot dog eating contest.\n\nYour stomach may never be the same\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania researchers, in concluding their study, had some grim predictions for life after competitive eating, which they called a \"potentially self-destructive form of behavior.\"\n\nThe researchers said the competitive eater, having lost the ability to feel full, could become obese.\n\nAnother possible issue is an eater could stretch their stomach so much that it no longer could contract and thus become unable to pass food. This condition, called gastroparesis, causes nausea and vomiting.\n\nBell suggests sticking to the basics this Fourth of July.\n\n\"A hot dog is a great American food, eaten one at a time,\" he said.\n\nJosh Peter of USA TODAY Sports contributed to this article.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2016/07/04/joey-chestnut-hot-dog-eating-contest/86675566/", "title": "Joey Chestnut regains hot dog eating title, sets record", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Joey “Jaws” Chestnut regained the Mustard Yellow International Belt Monday, ousting Matt “The Megatoad” Stonie of the championship title at the annual July Fourth hot dog eating contest at Nathan’s Famous in Coney Island on Monday.\n\nChestnut, 32, downed 70 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes — the most hot dogs and buns ever eaten at the competition — polishing off 17 more dogs than Stonie. Chestnut’s eight straight victories ended last year when he lost the championship title in an upset to Stonie. Both men are from San Jose, Calif.\n\nIn 2013, Chestnut set a world record by eating 69 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. Contest officials said Chestnut set a new record last month when he ate 73 1/2 hot dogs and buns during a qualifying event.\n\nAs he gripped the mustard-colored belt after his win Monday afternoon, Chestunt said Stonie had “woke up the sleeping giant” when he beat him out last year.\n\n“Last year was rough,” Chestnut told the crowd. “This year was the best ever.”\n\nStonie said there were “no excuses” for his loss. He said Chestnut did an amazing job.\n\nWith thousands of people — many wearing Nathan’s Famous hats — watching the eaters on an elevated stage along the famed Coney Island boardwalk, the next closest competitor ate 41 hot dogs.\n\nThe men’s contest came more than an hour after the women competed, with defending champion Miki Sudo capturing first place.\n\nThe Las Vegas woman scarfed down 38 1/2 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes to claim the championship title for the third straight year. Both she and Chestnut leave with $10,000 each.\n\nSudo, 30, downed 4 1/2 more wieners than prior champion Sonya “Black Widow” Thomas, 48, of Alexandria, Virginia, who devoured 34 hot dogs. Thomas had held the championship title from 2011 until she lost in an upset to Sudo in 2014.\n\nThe colorful holiday tradition draws its share of characters. Many in the crowd Monday wore foam hats shaped like hot dogs.

No other competitor has eaten more than 64½.\n\nAlmost all other competitive eaters do it part-time because they can't earn enough from it to make a living — much less the millions of dollars Chestnut said he has amassed.\n\nLast week, days before the hot dog eating contest he has dominated since 2007, Chestnut reflected on his decision in 2010 to leave his job with a construction management company in Northern California and become a full-time competitive eater.\n\n“My mom was worried,\" he said. “I mean, it’s nice to have a job. You’ve got health care and retirement, all that stuff. So I had to convince my mom that I still had a plan for all that stuff.\"\n\nA major Pepto-Bismol moment\n\nBy 2010, Chestnut had won the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest three times. Yet he still was working full-time for the construction management company and competing in food contests on weekends.\n\nThen came an offer from Pepto-Bismol.\n\nThe company wanted him to promote and participate in four competitive eating contests and would pay him $10,000 for each event, according to Chestnut, who said the problem was he'd have to miss several days of work.\n\n“So I ran it by my boss and he was like, ‘Oh, why don’t you just take the month off?’ \" said Chestnut, who did just that.\n\nIn a 2010 press release, Pepto-Bismol announced the promotion: The company would host four eating contests over five weeks during which teams of challengers would compete against Chestnut at food festivals in Portland, Oregon, Austin, Texas, San Francisco and Orchard Park, New York.\n\nDamon Jones, chief communications officer at Procter & Gamble -- the parent company of Pepto-Bismol -- on Saturday said he didn't have immediate access to the financial information. But as a matter of practice, he said, the company doesn't disclose payment terms with any promotional partners.\n\nAfter collecting on the four promotional contests, Chestnut said he made a decision.\n\nWith the blessing of his mother, he became a full-time competitive eater. Proof it was financially viable came in 2014, when at the age of 30, Chestnut, then living in San Jose, California, bought his first house – for $618,000, according to property records.\n\nDuring the process of obtaining a loan, Chestnut said there was an awkward moment of explaining he generated his income as a competitive eater – and was making more than $200,000 a year.\n\n“They’re like, ‘Oh, how long have you been doing it, though?’ \" Chestnut said. “I was able to show them that I guess I actually am stable.\"\n\n17 pounds of cherry pie with Goldman Sachs\n\nChestnut, who lives in the Indianapolis area with his fiancée, said he travels about 150 days a year for contests and appearances. This year, that included a burrito-eating contest in Milwaukee, where he scarfed 14½ burritos in 10 minutes and pocketed the first-place payout of $5,000.\n\nHe also devoured a half-dozen Coney Island hot dogs in 60 seconds during a paid appearance at a Detroit Pistons game. And ate 17½ pounds of cherry pie last year during an appearance at a Goldman Sachs' small business summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe declined to provide specific figures for his paid appearances. But with the hopes of further leveraging his celebrity, Chestnut signed with Everest Talent Management a year ago. The company’s clients include Pau Gasol, the retired six-time NBA All-Star who won two titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Alyssa Thompson, the 18-year-old soccer phenom and No. 1 overall pick of the 2023 NWSL Draft.\n\n“I’m really good at eating, (but) I don’t know my worth,\" Chestnut said. “I’m not good at negotiating contracts or making sure the contracts don’t conflict with each other. So it was really important.\"\n\nPepsi deal a 'game-changer'\n\nOver the past year and a half, the company secured him promotional deals with DUDE Wipes, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, Wonderful Pistachios and Pepsi.\n\nThe deal with Wonderful Pistachios features Chestnut in a national commercial, and Pepsi has him in the company’s current campaign for Pepsi Colachup, billed as the world's first Pepsi-infused condiment.\n\nChestnut declined to say what the promotional deals were worth, but did offer, “The Pepsi one is definitely a little bit of a game-changer.\"\n\nIt has helped change the bottom line, with Chestnut saying 2022 marked the first year his income exceeded $500,000.\n\nEvan Sroka, a co-founder of Everest Talent Management, said he had no comment on the agency's work with him.\n\nAs far as his net worth is concerned, Chestnut said he has amassed more than $4 million thanks to his good fortune. That includes buying stock in a company later acquired by Tesla.\n\nThe truth is, Chestnut could be earning more. Potentially much more.\n\nMatt Stonie, the last man to beat Chestnut at Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2015, now focuses on his lucrative YouTube Channel. He has more than 16 million subscribers and is widely believed to have made several million dollars for his food-eating exploits. He no longer goes head-to-head with Chestnut on the Fourth of July. Stonie did not respond to messages from USA TODAY Sports.\n\nChestnut said he has dabbled with his own YouTube channel, but it lacks what he loves most about competitive eating. On Tuesday, he likely will pocket another $10,000, which goes to the winner, but said money is not what drives him back to Coney Island every Fourth of July, where thousands of spectators cheer his every bite.\n\n“I love the competition,\" he said. \"The competition is the best.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/07/03/hot-dog-eating-contest-nathans-joey-chestnut-fourth-july/70377708007/", "title": "Hot dog contest: Joey Chestnut, Miki Sudo seek sweep", "text": "A small brigade of competitive eaters expected at the annual Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on the Fourth of July are traveling with passports.\n\nFrom Japan, South Korea and Brazil, they’ve descended. From Australia, England and Canada they’ve come, with $40,000 in prize money up for grabs during the event televised by ESPN. The women’s competition starts at 11 a.m. ET Tuesday, and the men’s side starts at 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\n“Periodically, we get enormous global interest,” said George Shea, the contest’s emcee. “This year we have a really powerful international contingent.’’\n\nThose international eaters should be braced to run into an unmovable American wall.\n\nJoey Chestnut, 39, will be aiming for his 16th title. He has lost just once since 2007. Miki Sudo, 38, will be seeking her ninth title. The only time she failed to win the women’s competition since 2014 is when she skipped the 2020 contest because she was pregnant.\n\nJapanese eaters once dominated the men’s side, winning 10 titles during the 11-year stretch between 1996 and 2006.\n\nBut in 2007, Chestnut wrested away the title from Takeru Kobayashi and since then has lost just once – in 2015 to Matt Stonie.\n\n'Hot dogs are a weird thing'\n\nLast year, Chestnut arrived for the contest on crutches, with his broken right leg in a cast. His mother had died less than two weeks earlier.\n\n“Looking back, it’s crazy that I even wanted to compete last year,’’ he said.\n\nChestnut ate 63 hot dogs and buns – more than enough for the victory but 13 fewer than the record-breaking 76 he’d eaten the year before. It was the first time at the contest since 2015 he’d eaten fewer than 70 hot dogs.\n\nCHESTNUT:'Worried' a year after tangling with protester at hot dog eating contest\n\nThe broken leg and grief might not have been the only factors during his performance, according to Chestnut, who said the number of hot dogs consumed was down for the entire field.\n\n“Hot dogs are a weird thing,’’ he said. “There can be just a natural variation in hot dogs because there’s a natural casing. I don’t know why, but some years the hot dogs are faster than others, and some years they’re way slower. The casings are harder to bite through, and that’s just the way it is.\n\n“If this year they’re cooked to the point where they’re spitting oil early, you can bite them and they snap, you’ll feel the juices flowing. Oh my God. The juicy hot dog is the best way.’’\n\nOn such a day, Chestnut said, he might be able to eat 78.\n\n“Oh man,’’ he said. “It gets my mouth watering just thinking about it.’’\n\nWhy a champ would change her technique\n\nWhile training for the contest last year, Sudo said, she ate 50 hot dogs and buns. That’s 1½ more than her personal record, the highest mark for any woman competitor.\n\nBut on July 4, she ate only 40. Even though she won the women’s title, disappointment about falling short of 50 has led to a likely change in technique after a decade of competing.\n\nNo more attacking hot dogs two at a time.\n\n“I normally try to eat two hot dogs side-by-side right out of the gate, which is fine at home,’’ Sudo told USA TODAY Sports. But in front of the crowd of thousands at Coney Island on the big day, Sudo said, her muscles tense up.\n\n“I just have difficulty swallowing the hot dogs side-by-side,’’ she said. “It doesn’t go as quickly as it does at home.’’\n\nIn past years, Sudo said, she used the side-by-side technique until she ate 30 hot dogs, then ate them one at a time. This year, it will be one at a time from the very start.\n\n“So I think I’ll be a little faster out of the gate and more consistent throughout,’’ she said, clearly focused on eating 50 hot dogs. “I know I can do it. I just need to make it happen on the Fourth on the stage.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2015/07/20/competitive-eating-dangers-matt-stonie-joey-chestnut/30439931/", "title": "Inside the disturbing dangers of competitive eating", "text": "Josh Peter\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAbout a week after eating 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes to win the Nathan's Famous hot-dog-eating contest, Matt Stonie drove to a Hooters and bought some chicken wings — 200 of them. By dinnertime, he'd polished them off as part of his training regimen for the Hooters Worldwide Wing Eating Championship to be held Saturday in Clearwater, Fla.\n\n\"It's hard work,\" he said. \"We push through the pain.\"\n\nThese so-called training sessions can include drinking more than a gallon of water and are used by competitors to stretch their stomachs so they can hold more food for contests. But they can lead to serious injuries and are part of what competitive eater Patrick Bertoletti calls the dark side of the sport.\n\nStonie calls it essential.\n\nStarting about a month and a half before he beat eight-time defending champion Joey Chestnut at the Nathan's Famous contest on the Fourth of July, Stonie said, he ate as many as 60 hot dogs three times a week and followed some of those practice sessions by drinking almost a gallon of water.\n\n\"Drinking as much water as I can afterwards till, bluntly put, I feel like I'm going to explode,\" said Stonie, who won $10,000 for his victory and positioned himself for lucrative appearance fees. \"It's pushing your limits.\"\n\nStonie, 23, has been pushing his limits at the table for several years. Although 5-8 and 125 pounds, he gained a following on YouTube — more than 600,000 subscribers strong now — by completing stunts such as drinking a gallon of Gatorade in 37 seconds and eating 6 pounds of pickled jalapenos.\n\nNow the stakes are higher, with first prize in the Hooters contest paying $8,500. Stonie said last week that he planned to eat 200 wings four to five times before the contest, which Chestnut won last year by eating 182 wings in 10 minutes.\n\n\"A lot of us don't know what we're doing,\" Stonie said of competitive eating tactics. \"We're just experimenting. Sometimes people go a little gung-ho, a little overboard, and hurt themselves.\"\n\nBertoletti, a longtime competitive eater who this year was awarded $10,000 and a Harley-Davidson when he won SportsRadio 94WIP's Wing Bowl in Philadelphia, said he was among those who had been injured while training. He declined to discuss the injury in detail.\n\n\"I don't want to hurt the sport, I don't want to hurt my marketability and I'm embarrassed,\" Bertoletti said.\n\nDespite the risk, Bertoletti said, he has continued to use the dangerous training methods because they help expand his stomach capacity and enhance his performance — from 37 hot dogs and buns during the 2010 Nathan's Famous contest to 53 the next year.\n\nGeorge Shea, who along with his brother runs the Nathan's contest and started Major League Eating, a national circuit that includes the Hooters contest, said he and his brother discouraged eaters from training.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,\" Shea said of the training. \"You don't need to do it. ... There's no arms race to 100 (hot dogs).\"\n\nBut among those who have acknowledged training are Chesnut, who holds the record of 69 hot dogs and buns consumed during the 2013 Nathan's contest.\n\nDave Brunelli, a former professional boxer who began competitive eating a few years ago, said he no longer consumed more than a gallon of water during training sessions because more than that left him feeling dizzy for weeks on end.\n\nCompetitive eaters face other risks, according to medical experts.\n\nThe training and competitions not only can cause gastric ruptures and drop sodium levels to dangerously low levels that might lead to seizures but also can trigger eating disorders, said Kim Dennis, an eating disorder expert from Chicago.\n\n\"Putting all of the health risks aside, there are certainly some psychological or psychiatric risks with regards to development of an eating disorder for people who had any sort of genetic predisposition to have one,\" said Dennis, a board-certified psychiatrist. \"Somebody eating 70 hot dogs in 10 minutes is self-abuse to some extent.\"\n\nA 2007 study entitled \"Competitive Speed Eating: Truth and Consequences\" and published in the American Journal of Roentgenology concluded: \"We speculate that professional speed eaters eventually may develop morbid obesity, profound gastroparesis, intractable nausea and vomiting and even the need for a gastrectomy. Despite its growing popularity, competitive speed eating is a potentially self-destructive form of behavior.\"\n\nBut the behavior can pay off for the top competitors. Stonie said that he made about $100,000 while competing in 17 events in 2014. This year he plans to make considerably more after his victory in the Nathan's contest against Chesnut, who made $230,000 last year, according to Shea.\n\nNo one has benefited more from competitive eating than Nathan's Famous. Its annual contest attracts about 40,000 people a year to watch in person outside the company's flagship restaurant on Coney Island in New York.\n\nBetween 2003, the year before ESPN first broadcast the contest, and 2014, the company's hot dog sales skyrocketed from fewer than 250 million to 1 billion.\n\nEric Smallwood, managing partner at Apex Marketing Group Inc. in suburban Detroit, said the contest had had an unmistakable impact on Nathan's.\n\nHe also noted the company's stock climbed to $53 a share in 2014 from $6 a share in 2004, the year ESPN first telecast the event, although the price per share has settled at about $32 while the contest continues to grow in popularity.\n\nMeanwhile, Stonie's stock is rising. He said a company called him about making his own trading card. And Major League Eating is flying him from his home in San Jose to Clearwater for the Hooters contest a day early to help publicize the event.\n\nBy then Stonie's training will be complete. And he all but shrugged off consuming 4 to 5 pounds of chicken meat during the practice sessions designed to help him knock off Chesnut and the rest of the field.\n\n\"It's nothing compared to stuff I do for other contests,\" he said. \"But it's still a good amount of food.\"\n\nOf the training, Stonie added: \"You wake up the next day, and you're bloated. It's not fun. It's work.\"\n\nPHOTOS: 2015 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/26/hot-dog-shortens-life-study-says-nathans-joey-chestnut-worried/5598206001/", "title": "Hot dog shortens life, study says. Is Nathan's Joey Chestnut worried?", "text": "Researchers at the University of Michigan released a peer-reviewed study last week claiming that eating a single hot dog can take 36 minutes off of a human's life. In contrast, the study found that eating nuts could add 26 minutes to someone's lifespan.\n\nThat study could cause someone to think twice about devouring a frankfurter at a baseball game or holiday cookout. It also takes a direct shot at a sportsman who has built his legacy off of eating hot dogs.\n\nHeat your meat:Pepperoni, salami, Italian-style deli meats investigated by CDC for salmonella\n\n\"Interesting, I might need to eat more nuts to go back in time,\" tweeted 13-time Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest champion Joey Chestnut, who owns the world record for eating 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes and, by the study's calculation, would've lost one year and 15 minutes of his life for consuming his estimated 19,200 hot dogs over 16 years.\n\nBut health experts say there's more complexity than simply replacing hot dogs with nuts.\n\nCould eating hot dogs actually shorten your life span?\n\nOlivier Jolliet, one of the lead researchers on the study, published in the journal Nature Food, told USA TODAY that 5,800 foods were evaluated and then ranked based on their nutritional disease burden as well as their impact on the environment. Hot dogs were considered the most unhealthy.\n\n\"I wouldn't get too worried about eating a hot dog from this,\" Jolliet said. \"Basically, we were trying to show how you can improve your lifestyle and the environment without necessarily trying to be vegan.\"\n\nThe study found that substituting 10% of daily caloric intake from beef and processed meats for a mix of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and select seafood could reduce your dietary carbon footprint by one-third and allow people to gain 48 minutes of healthy life per day.\n\n\"The condition of the study is for marginal change and for the every day (American) where they can make minimum changes in their diet for overall health and the environment,\" Jolliet said. \"For Mr. Chestnut, I think he could be better for his health if he doesn't eat that many hot dogs because they are processed meats, but our study was not meant to measure extreme eating.\"\n\nShould Joey Chestnut be worried?\n\nEvery Independence Day, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut takes center stage at Coney Island – with a live ESPN national audience – to do what no human has done before: Eating 70-plus hot dogs in 10 minutes. This past July 4, Chestnut eclipsed his own world record with 76 dogs.\n\nJOEY CHESTNUT:Should hot dog eating competition hero be included in greatest 'athlete' debate?\n\nChestnut, 37, is a year-long competitive eater who trains to master his hot dog dominance by consuming other foods like Twinkies, burgers, tamales, gyros and chicken – dude ate 413 wings in 12 hours. Chestnut is hailed by Major League Eating as the greatest of all-time.\n\nThat doesn't happen overnight. Chestnut told The Washington Post that he sees doctors, does dietary cleanses and eats healthy (believe it or not) when he's not in-season training. So when the study started to go viral, Chestnut, accordingly, disagreed with its premise.\n\n“People will think automatically that if they eat healthy food, they might live forever,” Chestnut said. “And then I see on Twitter like, ‘Oh, watch out, Joey Chestnut’s going to die.' There are so many other things to a person’s health than their worst eating habits. The only way I can continue doing (competitive eating) is by being healthy.”\n\nNutrition expert Dr. Cate Shanahan, author of \"The Fatburn Fix\" and a former consultant for the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Yankees and Green Bay Packers, said Chestnut is \"better off than the average American\" when he's eating healthy and exercising in conjunction with competitive eating.\n\n\"We have to define what is healthy eating carefully,\" she said. \"... If Mr. Chestnut does avoid seed oils, he can eat all the hot dogs he wants a couple times a year for a contest because the extra (food consumption) turns into body fat.\"\n\nCan hot dogs be a part of a healthy diet?\n\nRegardless of moderation, hot dogs are not exactly healthy. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) reported ham, hot dogs and other processed meats may contribute to colorectal cancer. Hot dogs also are high in saturated fat and sodium. Just one hot dog can contain over a quarter of your day’s sodium allowance and over 14 grams of fat.\n\nShanahan believes that while processed meats like hot dogs can inherently be unhealthy, it's wrong to zero in on just hot dogs as the study does in highlighting the food.\n\n\"We haven't established that hot dogs are toxic and not all hot dogs are created equal,\" she said. \"... What's most important to know about hot dogs is they don't have seed oils. And what's most unhealthy is industry-produced vegetable oils that accumulate in our body fat and disrupt our body's energy-producing systems.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/14/making-weight/25741977/", "title": "Health is more than absence of illness", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health.

The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/04/27/cafe-society-oh-la-la-ventura-baker-named-1st-american-team-fete-du-pain-competition-paris/542372002/", "title": "Ventura baker named to first American team competing in Paris event", "text": "Man may not live by bread alone, but don't tell that to the people of France.\n\nTwo of the country's most instantly recognizable cultural touchstones — the baguette and the Notre-Dame de Paris — will be featured when the 22nd annual Fête du Pain (aka Celebration of Bread) brings hundreds of bakers from around the world to a 12,000-square-foot tent filled with kitchens just steps from the Gothic cathedral.\n\nTimed to coincide with the birth date of Saint Honoré, the patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs, the nearly two-week-long event will culminate May 15 with a contest to see which of those temporary kitchens produces the best baguette de tradition.\n\nFor the first time, the competition will include a team from the United States, fielded by The Bread Bakers Guild of America. And on that team will be Jarrett Chambers, executive baker at Café Ficelle, the French-style bakery and cafe that opened in Ventura last summer.\n\n\"It's such an honor to be invited that I haven't even thought yet what it might be like if we win,\" Chambers said with a laugh. \"The worst thing that can happen is that we compete in France in front of the Cathedral Notre Dame.\"\n\nRestaurant review:Cafe Ficelle offers breakfast all day in Ventura\n\nFrom the archives:Cafe Ficelle to bring taste of France to Ventura (2016)\n\nThe 24-member team will be divided into three groups of eight bakers appearing on specific dates. Chambers' group is assigned to the final leg from May 12-16, placing him on baguette duty.\n\n\"It's a simple bread in that its ingredients are simple: nothing but flour, salt, water and fresh yeast. But everyone has the same exact ingredients. You're being judged on how well you know how to mix, divide and shape the dough. You're being judged on your skill set as a baker — how well you know the dough,\" he said.\n\nBorn in Charlotte, North Carolina, Chambers grew up in a family that included at least one professional baker in the mix: His paternal grandmother operated a wedding-cake business from the commercial kitchen installed at her home in Longview, Texas.\n\nBut when it came time to choose a profession, Chambers instead opted for physical therapy, majoring in exercise science at Liberty University in Virginia, where he met future wife Meg Chambers. (They are now parents to daughter Charlotte, 7 months as of April 30.)\n\nStill, his self-described \"scientific-mind\" curiosity about baking continued to rise. When then-future father-in-law Bryan Scofield, chef and owner of Ventura-based Scofield Catering & Management, mailed over a bag of flour, salt and yeast with a set of instructions for making bread, \"I caught the bug,\" Chambers said.\n\nAfter he and Meg married and made a post-graduation move to North Carolina, Chambers was working as an exercise physiologist during the week and making croissants for baby showers and other special occasions on the weekends.\n\nWhen the family started planning to open Café Ficelle, Chambers and Scofield prepared by enrolling in courses together at the San Francisco Baking Institute. In the fall of 2016, Chambers embarked on a three-week stage, training with pastry chefs and chocolatiers at the five-star Terre Blanche resort in the Provence region of France.\n\n\"There was a lot of high-volume variety, and everything was a showpiece,\" Chambers said of the items he helped prepare despite running into a language barrier. \"I learned that, if you want to succeed and keep up the quality of your breads and pastries, organization — your mise en place — is everything.\"\n\nThose skills have come in handy at Café Ficelle, which takes its name from the thin, baguette-like loaf of bread used in the cafe's sandwiches.\n\nWith Scofield as owner and executive chef, Chambers as executive baker and Scofield's middle daughter, Lyndy Woodruff, as service manager, the business also serves crepes, soups and salads in addition to producing a variety of artisanal breads and pastries. The daily selection may range from fougasse, a flatbread slashed to look like an ear of wheat, to a rye boule bedecked in flaxseeds.\n\nChambers made special batches of the latter for a bake sale designed to help cover costs associated with traveling to the competition. Held during a weekend in April, the sale also showcased some of the American-style baked goods Team USA will make for Fête du Pain judges in the days leading up to the baguette throwdown. In addition to donating $1,500 to the cause, Sysco donated ingredients used for double-chocolate brownies, four-strand challahs and fruit cobbler bars made with Terry Berries strawberries from Ventura.\n\nThe bakery also produced dozens of baguettes de tradition, in part so patrons and staff could compare and contrast the loaves against its regular baguettes made with a rye-based stater.\n\nThe bake sale may be over, but the Bread Bakers Guild of America GoFundMe campaign continues at https://www.gofundme.com/fete-du-pain.\n\n\"I haven't met my team members, but we've been connecting through email. I have books in the bakery that were written by some of these guys,\" Chambers said. \"We have an absolutely amazing group headed to Paris.\"\n\nCafe Ficelle is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays (390 S.

Though 12 of the 13 American colonies had already approved the resolution by July 2, 1776, even prompting John Adams to write his daughter with predictions of future July Second festivities, the document declaring independence from Britain wasn’t officially adopted until July 4.\n\nSome Americans began celebrating the very same year, though the practice wouldn’t become widespread until the aftermath of the War of 1812.\n\nCongress finally passed a bill making Independence Day a federal holiday on June 28, 1870. In 1941, the law was amended to make it a paid holiday for federal employees.\n\nThough some traditions associated with the Fourth of July have changed or disappeared over time – hosting mock funerals for the king of England, for example – many have remained true to their roots in the almost 250 years since the declaration was signed.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why we associate exploding colors in the sky and feasting on outdoor meals with celebrating America’s independence, read on to learn about the origins of our favorite July Fourth festivities.\n\nUltimate Fourth of July playlist:Your guide to the ultimate Fourth of July music playlist, from 'God Bless America' to 'Firework'\n\nFireworks\n\nFireworks displays are perhaps the most iconic of all Fourth of July revelries. The first celebration came in earnest on July 4, 1777, described on July 5 in the Pennsylvania Evening Post as a demonstration of “joy and festivities.”\n\nShips “dressed in the gayest manner, with the colors of the United States and streamers displayed” approached the city and fired off 13 cannon shots, one for each colony-turned-state. Later in the evening, 13 fireworks were set off in the city commons in Philadelphia and Boston, which the Evening Post described as a “grand exhibition of fireworks … and the city was beautifully illuminated.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Tyler Putman, senior manager of gallery interpretation at the Museum of the American Revolution, fireworks had been used in the colonies before 1776, but not in such grand fashion.\n\n“You would have seen fireworks at a lot of festivities, celebrations, anniversaries, you know, things like the king's birthday or big events, but they often were not enormous, launched-in-the-sky fireworks,” he told USA TODAY.\n\n“People would build these kind of structures and frameworks that would then catch on fire, or parts of them would launch off, and often they would be in certain shapes, like a bunch of stars or a dancing person … kind of like a Burning Man sort of thing.”\n\nIt wasn’t until the 18th century, said Putman, that fireworks were perfected and began to resemble the explosive rockets we know today.\n\nFireworks divide Americans:America's right to bear fireworks continues to make American Independence Day divisive\n\nParades\n\nVisit any city or town on the U.S. map on the Fourth of July and you could find a parade of some sort making its way through Main Street. Mentions of parades, another tradition that harks closely back to Revolution-era origins, can be found in the earliest correspondences about the newly minted but still unofficial holiday.\n\nIn a letter John Adams wrote to his daughter, Abigail Adams, on July 2, 1776, he described what would later be known as Independence Day, predicting it would become “the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America. − I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”\n\nThough Adams mistakenly asserted the holiday would be commemorated on the second of the month as opposed to the fourth, he was correct in his predictions of the merrymaking to follow.\n\n“It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,” he wrote.\n\nWhat's open on July 4th?Starbucks, McDonald's, Target, Walmart open; Costco closed\n\nBack then, parades looked markedly different from the ones we attend today.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, parades were generally reserved for the military, with armies marching the streets to reach their destinations. It wasn’t until years after the war, in the late 1700s to early 1800s, said Putman, that parades began to look more like what we would recognize today.\n\nWhen parades began to appear as part of annual celebrations as opposed to one-off events, they didn’t yet feature the marching bands and firetrucks we’re familiar with but instead were full of groups of normal people from town. The city’s butchers, for example, would walk together as one group, and shipbuilders would construct massive floats to be pulled down the street by horses.\n\n“Sometimes you read about parades where, like, in Philadelphia, tens of thousands of people are in the parade and you kind of wonder who is left to watch the parade,” Putman said. “There are so many people, if all the shipwright and the shoemakers and the grocers are all already marching the parade, it's mostly just kids, probably, who are like, ‘Well, I guess I'll wait as this 10,000-person parade goes by.’”\n\nBarbeques and picnics\n\nIndependence Day falling in early July is probably reason enough to enjoy a meal outside to take advantage of the warm summer weather. The urge to fire up the grill and lay a picnic blanket out on the grass, however, can also be tied back to original holiday celebrations.\n\n“The really interesting thing about the Fourth of July is that it then spawned all of these semi-public or private celebrations,\" Putman said. \"So, you might go watch the parade and then you have your family barbecue. In the late 1700s, 1800s, people might go out for a big public event, like a giant picnic or parade, but then they'll go back to taverns or family homes.”\n\nDrinking was certainly a prominent component for many Americans, some of whom would go to the local pub and propose toasts in the name of things like independence, the Constitution and the president. George Washington himself even issued double rations of rum to his soldiers on the 1778 and 1781 anniversaries in observation of the day.\n\nGrilling tips:Grilling your burgers wrong could be risky. Here's how to do it right\n\nBecause what we now know as barbeque food began as a form of cooking brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans, it had not yet become a staple of the national diet. Instead, revelers of the day probably would have attended a pig roast or seafood boil. It wasn’t until about 100 years after independence that barbeque went from being a food for poor, enslaved people to being popularized on a national scale, Putman said.\n\nFeasting and drinking \"was true of really elite people but also really poor, common, even enslaved people, not just on the Fourth of July, but other holidays would use this as a chance to kind of build community and think about what it meant to be an American.”\n\nRed, white and blue everything\n\nWalk into a grocery store in July today and you will be bombarded by red, white and blue plastered on everything from cocktail napkins to beach towels. In the early days of American independence, however, the colors were not yet representative of a flag that was recognized as universally and uniquely American. In fact, it wasn't until June 1777 that Congress even approved the first official iteration of the flag, which changed many times between inception and the final design created in 1960.\n\n“During the Revolutionary War, flags were something that had kind of a functional purpose: They fly above a fort or they're on the top mast of a ship,” Putman said. “It's really not until the American Civil War, the 1860s, that most people started to use the flag in more personal ways.”\n\nBefore then, you would never see the average person, for example, hanging a flag in front of their house, he said. The tensions of the Civil War prompted people to begin adopting iconography of flags, which not only delineated opposing sides of the war but stood as a symbol of different things for individual Americans, like emancipation for Black Americans. During this era, the flag began to appear in places other than flying in front of government buildings, such as on shirts.\n\nThis use of the flag’s colors on everyday items grew in popularity in the 1900s, said Putman, and has become even more common in the past few decades. The 50-star flag we now recognize was not unveiled until 1960, after Hawaii and Alaska joined the union in 1959.\n\nMore on the Fourth\n\nLooking for more ways to celebrate the Fourth?

When did Americans start observing the patriotic holiday, and why do we set off fireworks?\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Independence Day:\n\nWhat do we celebrate on July 4?\n\nJuly 4, also known as Independence Day, marks the anniversary of the Second Continental Congress adopting the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.\n\nThe Congress, made up of delegates from the United States’ original 13 colonies, unanimously approved the document that declared independence from Great Britain.\n\nBarbara Clark Smith, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY that it was an “extraordinary achievement for these colonists to get together” to adopt the founding declaration.\n\n“They did find a way to put differences aside and join together to work for a common goal,” she added. “While declaring independence, they also declared interdependence.”\n\nFun fact: The Continental Congress didn’t vote for independence on just July 4. Twelve of the 13 colonies had approved a resolution calling for independence on July 2, 1776.\n\nAnother fun fact: Many of the original signers didn’t ink their names on the Declaration of Independence until Aug. 2, 1776.\n\nTraveling for the Fourth of July?:Here are the worst times to hit the road\n\nWhat were the first Independence Day celebrations?\n\nSome Americans began celebrating July 4 the year after the Declaration of Independence was signed. In a letter to his daughter, former President John Adams wrote that July 4, 1777, was celebrated in Philadelphia “with a festivity and ceremony becoming the occasion,” according to the Library of Congress.\n\nBut July 4 became more widely observed by Americans following the War of 1812. Independence Day became the most important nonreligious holiday for many Americans by the 1870s, and Congress passed a law making Independence Day a federal holiday on June 28, 1870.\n\nWho wrote the Declaration of Independence?\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was penned by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nJefferson and four other members of the Second Continental Congress, including Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and Robert Livingston, made up a committee in 1776 tasked with drafting a declaration, which would later go through dozens of changes before being signed by 56 men.\n\nBut Jefferson is credited with writing the document we know today that calls for “unalienable rights” including “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nHowever, the declaration's famous words did not apply to everyone in the thirteen colonies, such as enslaved people, Indigenous populations and other groups.\n\nWhy do we have fireworks?\n\nAt the first July 4 celebration in Philadelphia in 1777, Americans fired a cannon 13 times in honor of the original 13 colonies. Thirteen fireworks were also fired in the city as part of the celebrations.\n\nRevelers in Boston set off fireworks in 1777 as well, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nKate Haulman, an associate professor of history at American University, told USA TODAY that fireworks and other festivities fit into a tradition of public celebrations in England, citing Guy Fawkes Day, which commemorates a foiled plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament.\n\nHaulman called early Independence Day celebrations \"a continuation of earlier kinds of political culture, but made American.\"\n\nAnd Americans have continued to celebrate with fireworks and into the 21st century, with sales of fireworks surging in 2020.\n\nHow will Americans celebrate July 4 this year?\n\nIn 2021, many Americans will both celebrate July 4 and commemorate being able to gather safely after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year released guidelines saying fully vaccinated U.S. residents can attend gatherings in homes or other indoor settings without wearing a mask or practicing social distancing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/03/july-4th-things-you-didnt-know/754244002/", "title": "July 4th: 9 things you didn't know about Independence Day", "text": "Across the country, Americans will don red, white and blue on July 4 to celebrate the nation's independence with barbecues, parades and fireworks.\n\nThe holiday commemorates the Founding Fathers' declaration of independence in 1776. The day has had a fascinating history ever since, rife with quirky coincidences and inventive celebrations.\n\nWant to impress your friends and family at this year's Fourth of July gathering? Check out these facts you might not have known about the holiday.\n\n1. Congress didn't actually vote for independence on July 4.\n\nTwelve of thirteen states approved a resolution for independence on July 2, not July 4, when the declaration was actually adopted. New York didn't vote until July 9. Many of the signers didn't attach their names to the document until August 2.\n\nJohn Adams famously insisted the annual celebration of independence be held July 2, not July 4, and refused to attend any events on the latter day.\n\n2. The Fourth of July didn't become an official holiday until over a century after America declared its independence.\n\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, that American independence should be celebrated with “pomp and Parade…Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.”\n\nThough early celebrations began the following year, the Fourth of July wasn't designated a federal holiday until 1870. In 1941, it became a paid holiday for federal employees.\n\n3. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington gave his soldiers a special treat for the holiday.\n\nOn July 4, 1778, George Washington ordered a double ration of rum for his soldiers. He also ordered a cannon salute to celebrate the occasion.\n\nDrinking was a large part of historical Fourth of July celebrations — it was traditional to drink 13 toasts, one for each state in the union.\n\n4. In a bizarre coincidence, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both died on July 4, 1826 — the nation's 50th birthday.\n\nThe two founding fathers and political adversaries died within five hours of each other.\n\nAs Adams lay on his deathbed, unaware that Jefferson had died earlier that day in Monticello, he reportedly spoke his last words: \"Jefferson still survives\".\n\nJames Monroe was the third president to die on July 4: he passed away in 1831.\n\n5. Calvin Coolidge is the only president to be born on July 4.\n\nCoolidge, the 30th U.S. president, was born on Independence Day in 1872.\n\nOther July 4 birthdays include first daughter Malia Obama, gangster Meyer Lansky, author Nathaniel Hawthorne, and reality TV star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino.\n\n6. The United States isn't the only country to celebrate independence on July 4.\n\nThe Philippines gained its independence from U.S. colonial control on July 4, 1946, and the day became a national holiday.\n\nIn 1962, however, the day was changed to June 12 in light of rising Filipino nationalism and resentment toward prior American colonialism. July 4 remains on the books as \"Philippine Republic Day,\" but isn't widely observed.\n\n7. Celebrating with fireworks is as old as the holiday itself.\n\nAt the first Fourth of July celebrations, which took place in Philadelphia in 1777, revelers fired a cannon 13 times, once for each colony. That night, 13 fireworks were fired off from the city's commons.\n\nThe tradition has only blossomed since then. In 1934, an explorer in Antarctica set off fireworks to celebrate the holiday in relatively warm weather for the continent: 33 degrees below zero.\n\n8. And today, fireworks are a massive industry.\n\nAccording to the American Pyrotechnics Association, Americans spent over $1 billion on fireworks in 2017. That number has roughly tripled over the last 20 years.\n\n9. July 4 is the biggest hot dog day of the year.\n\nAmericans consume roughly 150 million hot dogs on the Fourth of July — enough to stretch from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles five times.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, which is over a century old, takes place July 4 every year.

Every July 4 at 9 a.m. she welcomes a crowd and gives attendees turns reading from the declaration that was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, but not formally voted upon until August of that year.\n\nAnderson said she didn’t want the significance of the holiday to be overshadowed by fireworks, parties and barbecues.\n\n“I just felt like it needed to be done ... especially after 9/11,” Anderson said. “I felt people needed to know the reason why we fought for our freedom from tyranny ... and what better way than to read the Declaration of Independence in public with everyone reading a part of it?”\n\nSome have come nearly every year, but others, like the Geiger family, were riding their bicycles past the beach when they came upon the gathering and stopped.\n\n“We’re happy to step in and help,” Jim Geiger said as he and his children — Grace, James and Kaitlyn — stood on the grass practicing reading through the passages they were assigned to read aloud when the time came.\n\nJune Parks held a large American flag throughout the event. She stood by the World War I Doughboy statue that has a plaque with the names of those from town who served their country during that time.\n\nThe names of her father, Holder Manchester, and uncle, Horace Waite, are on it, she said.\n\n“It’s important to show our support for the USA,” Parks said of taking part in the July 4 event, “and the flag and for what it stands for.”\n\nJust up the hill, on Highland Road, is Fort Barton, where Revolutionary War soldiers had a fortification that overlooked the ferry crossing between Aquidneck Island and Tiverton. The ferry landing, next to what is now Grinnell’s Beach, was a launching point during the Battle of Rhode Island.\n\nIt’s also from where American revolutionaries left to plan and then execute a midnight raid of British headquarters in Portsmouth and the capture of British General Richard Prescott in July 1777.\n\n“Tiverton is so full of history,” said Sally Black, who was dressed from foot to mask in red, white and blue.\n\nShe didn’t need the hand-sized book Anderson handed out with copies of the declaration in it to recite some of it.\n\n“We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor,” Black said of the ending of the declaration. “That means we all come together and do whatever it takes to make things work.”\n\nAnderson spends a few minutes before the reading every year to remark about other memorable events throughout our history, including the first America’s Cup race in 1930 and Rhode Islander Claudine Schneider being the first woman elected to Congress in 1980.\n\nIn 1950, the Pocasset School was built, which was also the year Hostess Twinkies and Scotch Tape were invented, said Anderson.\n\n“2020 will go down in history because of the pandemic,” she said speaking through her face mask of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the end of the reading of the declaration, the crowd joined Anderson in singing God Bless America. She also offered a prayer.\n\nJim Spears and wife Alita Marks usually spend July 4 with family in the lakes region of New York, but stayed put this year because of COVID-19.\n\n“It seemed like the thing to do,” Spears said of attending and taking part in the reading of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMarks, who was wearing red, white and blue star earrings, said she hasn’t been many places since the pandemic began, but said of this event: “It’s a good thing to do on the Fourth of July.”\n\nKathy Quinley said she’s been coming to the event every year.\n\n“I think it’s important to remember the people who have gone before us and in their own way have helped us become independent,” said Quinley. “It’s given other people the opportunity to have the freedom we’ve had.”\n\nmpobzeznik@NewportRI.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/06/70-years-later-flag-day-celebration-perseveres-quincy-anniversary/9913538002/", "title": "More than 70 years later, Flag Day celebration perseveres in Quincy", "text": "QUINCY – At Cavanaugh Field on Saturday, June 14, 1952, a small line of Quincy kids walked in a circle carrying small, handheld American flags.\n\nIt had only been a few years since Congress declared Flag Day a national holiday, and a proud Richard Koch led his team of youth baseball players around the field, telling each of them why they gathered to mark such an occasion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2021/07/01/america-patriotic-travel-destinations-history-july-4th-independence-day-freedom/7795517002/", "title": "Patriotic places, cloaked in US history, to add to your next road trip", "text": "Frances Scott Key was so inspired by his fellow Americans' valor during the War of 1812's Battle of Baltimore that he penned the \"Defence of Fort M'Henry,\" the poem that would go on to become the national anthem.\n\nAmerica's early battlegrounds and historic places continue to inspire generations, whose independence was won by patriots taking on the most powerful empire of their time: Britain.\n\n\"It's its own kind of time machine,\" said Mary Koik, Director of Communications for the nonprofit American Battlefield Trust, which works to preserve battlefields from the Revolutionary War through the Civil War. \"There is something really profound about going to places where history happened.\"\n\n►Why is Independence Day on July 4th?:And when did fireworks become a tradition?\n\nJamestown, Virginia\n\nMany Americans recognize Pocahontas and Captain John Smith from history books or Disney's fictionalized film, but they were real people tied to Jamestown, which English settlers founded in 1607, years before Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock. Pocahontas' widower John Rolfe famously documented the first Africans to arrive in the Virginia colony in 1619. (However, both enslaved and free Africans had been in North America for decades, arriving with the Spaniards who settled St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565.)\n\nJamestown is part of Colonial National Historical Park, which also includes Yorktown Battlefield. Admission to both National Park Service sites costs $15 for visitors ages 16 and up. Kids who are younger are free. For $25, visitors can access additional Historic Jamestowne sites run by Preservation Virginia, as well as both NPS sites.\n\nPlymouth Rock, Massachusetts\n\nPlymouth Rock isn't nearly as big as its cultural significance. The rock at Pilgrim Memorial State Park in Plymouth, Massachusetts, may not even be the one the Pilgrims landed on in the Mayflower back in 1620, but it's believed to mark the location, as well as the milestone. Visitors can take a self-guided walking tour of other monuments and memorials in the park. The only fee is $1.25 for hourly parking from April through November.\n\nFor more, the nearby nonprofit Plimoth Patuxet Museums provide an immersive taste of life for the Pilgrims and Native Wampanoag people through the Historic Patuxet Homesite, a recreated 17th-century village and a full-scale reproduction of the Mayflower. Adult admission ranges from $8.95 for the Plimoth Grist Mill to $42.50 for a Heritage Pass that covers everything.\n\nBoston Freedom Trail\n\nThe path to freedom literally runs through Boston. A self-guided tour along the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail won't cost a penny, but admission fees are required to enter some of the 16 official sites along the way, like the Paul Revere House and Old State House, a seat of British rule. Like a number of other sites run by the National Park Service, the Revolutionary-era meeting house Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill Monument remain closed for COVID-19 safety measures.\n\nBunker Hill was where \"New England soldiers faced the British army for the first time in a pitched battle\" in 1775, according to the monument's NPS website.\n\nIndependence Hall, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was approved in the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, on July 4, 1776. (It wasn't officially signed until Aug. 2.) Independence Hall visitors can also see the famed Liberty Bell, which according to its NPS website, used to \"ring to call lawmakers to their meetings and the townspeople together to hear the reading of the news.\" Timed-entry tickets are required to visit Independence Hall. Tickets are free in person or $1 in advance.\n\nDeclaration of Independence, Washington, D.C.\n\nVisitors can see the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and Magna Carta in person for free in the Rotunda of the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Of course, the city is also home to the White House, U.S. Capitol and myriad other landmarks and artifacts significant to U.S. history.\n\nSaratoga Battlefield, New York\n\nThe Battle of Saratoga made world history in 1777. It was the first time that the British Army ever surrendered anywhere. The battlefield is just one part of Saratoga National Historic Park in New York. It also includes the country estate of Revolutionary War Gen. and U.S. Sen. Philip Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton's father-in-law. The Schuyler House is closed for COVID-19 safety measures. Visitors can find the latest closures and other warnings on the Active Alerts page of the NPS website.\n\n►All the beauty, none of the crowds:America's least-visited national parks\n\nCowpens Battlefield, South Carolina\n\nThe Battle of Cowpens marked a turning point for the Southern Campaign of the Revolutionary War, with a stunning American victory.\n\n\"Everyone gives all this credit to, 'Oh, it's Lexington and Concord, and it's the fighting in New York and New Jersey,' but in some really deep, profound ways, the revolution is won in the South,\" said American Battlefield Trust's Koik. \"You know they chase (British Gen. Charles) Cornwallis out of the Carolinas, and he gets to Yorktown, and he ends up surrendering.\"\n\nAdmission to Cowpens National Battlefield in Gaffney, South Carolina, is free.\n\nYorktown Battlefield, Virginia\n\nGen. George Washington led the Continental Army to victory in the decisive Battle of Yorktown, the last major battle of the Revolutionary War. Yorktown Battlefield is part of Colonial National Historical Park in Virginia. The National Park Service charges a $15 admission fee that covers Yorktown and parts of Jamestown for visitors age 16 and over. Younger kids are free.\n\n►Free national park days:When you can visit national park sites for free this year\n\nFort McHenry, Maryland\n\nSome historians consider the War of 1812 the second Revolutionary War. By the time the British set their sights on Baltimore in 1814, Washington, D.C., had already been captured and burned.\n\nThe rockets that red glared and bombs bursting in air that Frances Scott Key wrote about referred to the attack on Fort McHenry.\n\nThe flag is still there. It's free to visit the grounds of Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, but admission to the historic fort is $15 for visitors age 16 and over. It's free for younger kids.\n\nChalmette Battlefield, Louisiana\n\nGen. Andrew Jackson led America to victory in 1815's Battle of New Orleans, the last major battle in the War of 1812. Admission to Chalmette Battlefield is free.\n\nIndependence was costly. Thousands of Americans died fighting for independence across both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.\n\n\"Declaring it didn't achieve it,\" Koik said. 'The actual independence of America was won, and it was won on the battlefields.\"\n\n\"When you go to these places, in a way, you're touching the past,\" she added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2016/06/24/readers-choice-best-american-summer/86329846/", "title": "Readers' Choice: Best of American summer", "text": "10Best Editors\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best\n\nSummer is fast approaching, and when we think about what the season evokes, we think outdoor festivals, BBQ, ball games, patriotism and good old-fashioned Americana.

More than 3,500 Alabama employees in the field retired in the most recent period tracked, Al.com reports. That’s the most since the 2010-11 school year, when just under 4,100 employees retired after changes to the state’s retirement benefits. The numbers are from Alabama’s Teacher Retirement System. The large number of employees retiring is likely due to pandemic stresses, Roanoke City Schools Superintendent Chuck Marcum said.\n\nAlaska\n\nMeadow Lakes: Numerous residents of this Anchorage suburb want officials to deny a permit for a proposed gravel pit, arguing the mine doesn’t belong in a residential area and raising concerns about road safety and decimated property values. Quality Asphalt Paving and parent company Colaska Inc., part of the international Colas Group, have proposed the gravel pit for 160 forested acres in Meadow Lakes, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. Notices went out to more than 270 landowners within a half-mile of the site in mid-May, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The site is bounded by residential properties on three sides and a mix of commercial and residential on the fourth. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing on Colaska’s application for a conditional use permit July 19. There are already more than 100 active permitted pits across the borough. Matanuska-Susitna generally has few, if any, zoning laws that prohibit industrial operations like gravel pits in neighborhoods. At most, there could be 500 trucks making 1,000 daily trips to and from the pit, though the application indicates that’s not an average or constant number. Some residents say Sylvan Road, already crumbling in places, can’t handle up to 1,000 truck trips a day.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Residents are being asked to conserve energy this summer, city officials said. The city of Mesa does not own or operate any electric generators and purchases its electric supply through various short- and long-term agreements. This year, supply costs have increased dramatically because of the region’s population growth and the transition to newer and cleaner energy production, city officials said. Residents are being asked to set thermostats at 78 degrees Fahrenheit during the peak hours of 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. or when not at home. Authorities said setting the air conditioner 5 degrees higher could save up to 20% on cooling costs. Mesa also is working to reduce peak electrical usage at city facilities while also developing programs for customers to save energy and money while reducing demand during peak hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday reported 1,246 new coronavirus cases and 23 more hospitalizations from the past three days as Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that Arkansas could face a “tough week” in the virus’s growth. The Department of Health said the biggest jump over the weekend came Saturday, when the state added 764 new cases. The department recently stopped reporting daily COVID-19 numbers on weekends, releasing the figures on Mondays instead. The department said there were 361 people hospitalized because of COVID-19. The department reported COVID-19 deaths rose by seven to 5,920 since the pandemic began. Hutchinson noted that the state has now surpassed 1 million people fully vaccinated. “This is a milestone, but we need to pick up the pace before school starts this fall,” the Republican governor tweeted. “This could be a tough week in new cases and hospitalizations, so get the shot now.” Arkansas has had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Forty-two percent of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 34.5% of residents have completed their vaccinations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBorrego Springs: An annual count of bighorn sheep scheduled for this past weekend in a Southern California desert was canceled after a volunteer died while preparing for the excursion amid scorching heat, according to a newspaper report Sunday. The tally in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park dates back 50 years and is one of the longest-running citizen-science projects in the country, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. It typically draws dozens of volunteers who spend three days collecting information for scientists monitoring the health of bighorn sheep, which have been on the federal endangered species list since the late 1990s. Don White, a 68-year-old nature enthusiast from Culver City, had participated in the past and this year was assigned a spot in Borrego Palm Canyon that requires a 4-mile hike in over and around boulders. An experienced backpacker, White had counted there before. Two weeks ago, he and a colleague decided to hike in with bottled water and leave it there for the count. Coming back from the canyon just after noon June 19, not far from the trailhead, White collapsed and died, the Union-Tribune reports. His colleague was hospitalized briefly, as was a firefighter who came to assist them. It was 116 degrees Fahrenheit in Anza-Borrego that day. After last year’s count was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 tally had drawn so much interest that there was a waiting list, according to the newspaper.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: More than 70% of adults in the state have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, meeting the July Fourth goal set by President Joe Biden. However, most of the state’s 64 counties have not come close to that mark. As of Sunday, only 12 Colorado counties had vaccinated at least 70% of people eligible to be inoculated, KUSA-TV reports. Forty-five percent of counties had vaccinated less than half of the eligible population with at least one dose. While the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has become the dominant strain in Colorado, the number of people testing positive for the virus is down. Hospitalizations are also decreasing but are higher than during lulls last year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has unveiled a new website to provide up-to-date information on the rollout of legalized cannabis, ranging from basic information about the law that took effect July 1 to resources for prospective marijuana-related businesses. While portions of the new law have taken effect, including making it legal for individuals age 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material,” several key parts of the legislation don’t begin for another year or two. The establishment of retail stores, for example, isn’t expected until the end of 2022. “This new website will be an important resource for consumers and interested business owners,” Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle H. Seagull said in a statement. “We will continue to provide information about the licensing and application process as it becomes available, and we are committed to a clear and transparent process.” People can find the website at ct.gov/cannabis. State officials are encouraging residents to check the site regularly for updates on various provisions of the new, wide-ranging law, including the Social Equity Council, which will oversee the verification of “equity applicants” for marijuana-related licenses.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: A boardwalk beef has been brewing over a no-ketchup policy at a popular french fry stand. Regular visitors to the town’s three popular Thrasher’s French Fries establishments know better than to ask for ketchup. Piping hot fries, cooked in peanut oil, are famously served with only salt and apple cider vinegar – no ketchup, not ever. That’s how it’s been since the concession stand was founded on the Ocean City, Maryland, boardwalk in 1929, and there are no plans to deviate from this Eastern Shore tradition. But not all tourists know or even care about Thrasher’s history. They just want ketchup. And that has sparked something of a condiment clash with some neighboring businesses, particularly Gus & Gus Place. The iconic eatery offering burgers, fried chicken and corn dogs on Rehoboth’s mile-long boardwalk since 1956 won’t give away or even sell the condiment to non-customers. Still, that hasn’t stopped nearby Thrasher’s patrons from demanding ketchup, trying to sneak squirts from Gus & Gus’s ketchup bottles or attempting to walk off with packets. It’s become such a problem that the cash-only, family-owned business put up a sign near the counter: “Ketchup is for Gus & Gus food only. No exceptions!” It hasn’t worked. “People pretty much cuss at us a lot,” said Bill Svolis, 47, who has grown up in the business founded in 1956 by his father, Gus. “It happens almost every day.” Police have even been called to help deal with belligerent customers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The newest member of the U.S. Capitol Police force is Lila, a 2-year-old black Labrador retriever recruited to help troubled and stressed officers, WUSA-TV reports. The pup couldn’t quite make the cut as a guide dog for the visually impaired. “Poor Lila is a little bit of a sensitive soul, so asking her to do that guide work – even though she could – you can definitely see that it was a difficult task for her,” said Guide Dogs of the Desert training director Michal Anna Padilla. U.S. Capitol Police has lost three officers in 2021 in what the force officially considers “line of duty” deaths: Brian Sicknick, who suffered a stroke the day after confronting rioters at the Capitol in January; Howard Liebengood, who died from suicide days after confronting the insurrectionists; and William Evans, whom a driver pinner with a vehicle while ramming a barricade April 4, according to Capitol Police. Lila arrived from Palm Springs, California, on the Fourth of July, getting pet by passengers who heard the announcement of her new assignment. On her first full day in town Monday, Lila played the role of tourist as she walked around the Capitol grounds. Her “office” will be at the Capitol Police headquarters a block away.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City Beach: There’s really no way to know if condos across the city are slowly sinking into the sand, experts say. About a week after Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida, partially collapsed, leaving dozens and more than 100 others missing, local officials said condos in Bay County are not required to inspect height or track changes over time. While it remains unknown exactly what caused the Miami-area condo to crumble, some believe the collapse is linked to the fact that the building was sinking about 2 millimeters per year. “There’s always a worry,” Mark McWaters, building inspector for Panama City Beach, said of the possibility for a local collapse. “Things are man-made, they’re not perfect, and so there could be a flaw in something that’s not seen. If something is seen, we will address it.” According to information provided by the Bay County Property Appraiser’s office, there are almost 390 active condominiums in Bay County. About 135 are high-rises, which boast five or more stories, that were built between 1965 and 2020. Almost 20 are as old as or older than Champlain Towers South, which was constructed in 1981. David Jordan, division chief of fire inspection for Panama City Beach Fire Rescue, said he believes the collapse in Miami sparked a need for steeper regulations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: The longest-married presidential couple in American history are celebrating 75 years since they tied the knot. As a young midshipman, Jimmy Carter needed a date one evening while he was home from the U.S. Naval Academy, so his younger sister paired him with a family friend who already had a crush. Nearly eight decades later, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter are still together in the same tiny town where they were born, grew up and had that first outing. In between, they’ve traveled the world as Naval officer and military spouse, as American president and first lady, and finally as human rights and public health ambassadors. “It’s a full partnership,” the 39th president told the Associated Press during a joint interview ahead of the couple’s 75th wedding anniversary Wednesday. Carter, 96, has said often since leaving the Oval Office in 1981 that the most important decision he ever made wasn’t as head of state, commander in chief, or even executive officer of a nuclear submarine in the early years of the Cold War. Rather, it was falling for Eleanor Rosalynn Smith in 1945 and marrying her the following summer. “My biggest secret is to marry the right person if you want to have a long-lasting marriage,” he said. The nonagenarians – she’s now 93 – offered a few other tips for an enduring bond, including communication, reconciliation and finding common interests. They read the Bible together aloud each night, something they’ve done for years, even when separated by their travels. And “each (person) should have some space,” the former first lady said. “That’s really important.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: For nearly a year, Maui residents had their tropical oasis virtually to themselves. Then the visitors all came flooding back. “Over-tourism” has long been a complaint of locals on the island that is among the world’s most popular getaways: congested roads, crowded beaches, packed restaurants. But as the U.S. begins to emerge from the pandemic, Maui is reeling from some of the same strains seen on the mainland, like a shortage of hospitality workers. And its restaurants, still operating at limited capacity, are struggling to keep up. Now, as cooped-up mainlanders return in droves, Maui officials are making an unusual plea to airlines: Please don’t bring so many people to our island. “We don’t have the authority to say stop, but we are asking the powers to be to help us,” Mayor Michael Victorino said at a recent news conference. Hawaii has had some of the nation’s most stringent coronavirus public health restrictions, and it’s the only state that hasn’t fully reopened, in part due to its remote location and limited hospitals. Also high on people’s minds is the memory of diseases that wiped out 80% of the Native Hawaiian population in the century after Europeans arrived. The governor doesn’t plan on lifting all restrictions until 70% of the state’s population is vaccinated. As of Friday, just 58% of residents were.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials and a sheep industry group have filed notices to appeal a federal court ruling involving an eastern Idaho sheep research facility long targeted by environmental groups concerned about the potential harm to grizzly bears and other wildlife. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and American Sheep Industry Association filed the notices late last month to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A judge’s ruling in April prevents grazing in significant areas used by the Agriculture Department’s U.S. Sheep Experiment Station. Grazing was suspended in 2013 following previous lawsuits by environmental groups contending the areas contain key wildlife habitat that is a corridor for grizzly bears between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. Conservation groups contend grizzly bears have been killed because of sheep station activities. The groups also say bighorn sheep, which can acquire deadly diseases from domestic sheep, and greater sage grouse use the area. Grazing resumed following the release of a 2017 environmental impact statement considering the effects of sheep grazing on wildlife. The sheep station, operated by the Agriculture Department’s Agricultural Research Service, supports research using domestic sheep owned by the University of Idaho, some involving grazing at higher altitudes.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Department of Transportation is accepting applications for projects to improve public transit systems outside Chicago. IDOT said last week that the Rebuild Illinois capital construction program will pay for this round of projects totaling $110 million. Projects must expand and upgrade service, increase options and improve quality of life. Applications for the transit capital grant program are due Aug. 31. A total of $355 million is targeted for competitive construction grants for transit programs outside Chicago. Thus far, the program has renovated bus stations and passenger information kiosks for the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District and built a new transportation center in downtown Bloomington. Jacksonville received a facility to serve as headquarters, for training and dispatch. IDOT maintains “Public Transportation Providers” information online. Eligible recipients will be invited to a July 14 webinar to address specific questions and review the application process.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A judge has sided with the governor in a dispute between top state Republicans over whether he can proceed with a lawsuit challenging the increased power state legislators gave themselves to intervene during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The Marion County judge’s ruling rejects arguments from Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is allowed under the Indiana Constitution, despite GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb’s objections. Judge Patrick Dietrick wrote in the ruling dated Saturday that such an interpretation would give the attorney general greater power than Holcomb as head of the state’s executive branch in protecting the governor’s constitutional powers. “This is an absurd result that could not have been intended by either the drafters of Indiana’s Constitution or the General Assembly,” Dietrick said. Holcomb’s lawsuit argues that the law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative “emergency session” during statewide emergencies declared by the governor.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: The father of an 11-year-old boy who died following an accident on a popular boat ride at an amusement park said his son and other family members were trapped by the ride’s seat belts when the boat carrying them flipped. In an interview broadcast Tuesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” David Jaramillo recounted what happened when the boat capsized Saturday night on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona. “When it flipped over, all of us were trapped in the safety seat belts,” he said. “I see the silhouettes of my sons trying to grab each other, grab us. They want us to help them. We couldn’t do it.” Michael Jaramillo died Sunday from his injuries, and the morning news program reported his older brother was hospitalized in critical condition in a medically induced coma. Two other riders who were also family members suffered injuries. “I feel like Adventureland robbed me of my baby,” said Sabrina Jaramillo, Michael’s mother. “I will never get a chance to see him grow up.” The ride uses a conveyor belt to move large circular rafts through rapids. After the boat carrying six people overturned, emergency responders and witnesses helped to free the riders. The cause of the accident – the second deadly incident on the ride in five years – is under investigation.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About 600 workers are on strike at the Frito-Lay plant in the city after union workers rejected a proposed contract that had been recommended by union leadership. Workers said the main points of contention are small pay increases and employees being forced to work hours of overtime. The workers are represented by Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union, which recommended a proposed two-year contract after months of negotiations. Workers voted Friday and Saturday to reject the contract, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Frito-Lay is one of seven divisions of Harrison, New York-based PepsiCo. The company said in a statement that because the union leadership recommended the contract, it does not anticipate any further negotiations “for the foreseeable future.” PepsiCo said the plant would continue to operate, and it had a plan to ensure employee safety.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: As Fourth of July fireworks sent pets around the city into hiding, several volunteers spent the evening comforting animals at the Kentucky Humane Society. Fireworks have been a Fourth of July tradition since the United States first celebrated the anniversary of its Independence Day in 1777, and every year millions of cats and dogs panic in confusion from the loud bangs. While there are several recommended steps to help four-legged friends get through the traumatic night, not all animals have a family to keep them safe. To help some of those animals, multiple volunteers spent time with dogs and cats at the Kentucky Humane Society on Sunday to make sure they were comfortable and relaxed. “Volunteers distributed special treats and read children’s books to the animals to distract them,” the nonprofit wrote on its Facebook page. “Many pets fell fast asleep on their beds – some were even snoring!” Pets’ dislike of fireworks is a result of their advanced hearing capabilities. Nadine Znajda, a veterinary dermatologist from BluePearl Pet Hospital, said part of pets’ sensitivity to sound stems from their wide range of hearing. For dogs, who can perceive both audible and vibrational sounds, hearing is full-body sensory experience, Znajda said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Ballots have gone out for state lawmakers to decide whether to hold a historic veto override session, with heavy pressure pouring in from outside groups trying to sway that decision and a heated debate taking shape on social media. Gov. John Bel Edwards rejected 28 bills from the regular session and struck out a handful of legislative pet projects from budget bills. The Louisiana Constitution calls for a veto session to be automatically scheduled when a governor jettisons legislation. However, a majority vote of either the House or Senate can scrap the gathering – a decision that often is an afterthought for lawmakers who have canceled every veto session since the modern constitution was enacted in 1974. But this time appears different, with two bills in particular drawing interest for a mid-July veto session from the majority-Republican House and Senate: a measure banning transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender and legislation allowing people 21 and older to carry a concealed handgun without needing a permit. Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder said he supports the veto session, as does House GOP leader Blake Miguez. “I don’t see how we could avoid one,” said Houma Rep. Tanner Magee, the House’s second-ranking Republican.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: State officials have launched a new tool to help people who believe they spotted a white shark find out if it was indeed the big fish. The Maine Department of Marine Resources has added the online tool to its website with a form that allows shark spotters to upload photos and videos and submit a description of what they saw. People often mistake ocean sunfish, basking sharks and other harmless animals for white sharks, said Erin Summers, the director of the marine department’s biological monitoring division. She said the online tool will “help people gain a better understanding of the species found in the Gulf of Maine.” Scientists with the marine department will review the information when they receive it and might request more information. White sharks, also called great whites, aren’t common in Maine, but they can occur in the state’s waters. A white shark bite killed Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, last summer when she was swimming off Bailey Island. Interest in the species has increased in the state since.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s highest court has upheld a lower court’s emergency order keeping Maryland enrolled in enhanced federal unemployment programs. News outlets report that Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera on Monday dismissed Gov. Larry Hogan’s attempt to block the 10-day temporary restraining order issued a Baltimore judge issued Saturday. Unemployed residents will continue to receive federal unemployment benefits, including supplemental $300 weekly payments, through at least July 13. The Court of Special Appeals, the state’s second-highest court, had rejected an appeal from Hogan and the state’s Department of Labor on Saturday evening. The parties will return to Baltimore Circuit Court on Friday for a hearing on the matter and continue on Monday, if necessary. Hogan’s administration had planned to cut off the benefits over the weekend, ahead of their expiration in September. Other states with Republican governors have taken similar steps. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that ending the benefits early would cut off a lifeline for struggling families. Hogan has said ending the benefits will help get people into jobs.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The Peabody Essex Museum is offering vaccination clinics and expanding its hours as the coronavirus pandemic eases in the state, museum officials announced Tuesday. The new, expanded hours kick off Friday, when the Salem museum holds the first of several COVID-19 vaccination clinics. The clinics, in partnership with Curative, will offer Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson shots at no cost on Fridays from 4 to 7 p.m. through Aug. 13. Visitors who get a shot also get free admission and will be entered into the state’s vaccine lottery with a chance to win either $1 million or a $300,000 college scholarship. The museum has also lifted its mask mandate for staff and visitors in accordance with public health recommendations and will soon resume historic house and gallery tours. Enhanced sanitation and disinfection efforts will continue. The museum closed in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic and reopened with limited hours last summer. “We have much in store this summer with hybrid virtual and live programs, new exhibitions, and a renewed sense of gratitude for being able to celebrate creativity and connection,” Robert Monk, the museum’s interim chief operating officer, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday called for allotting $150 million in federal coronavirus rescue funds for the state’s local parks and trails – the second time she has proposed major recreation spending in less than a month. The proposal, if approved by lawmakers, would authorize the state to disburse grants to applicants. The governor said the spending on parks and recreation would boost tourism, particularly aiding seasonal and rural economies, and help sectors disproportionately hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Right now this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make transformative investment in our outdoors spaces, and we ought to take it,” she said during a news conference at Connor Bayou Park in Grand Haven. The money could be used to make parks more accessible and to build playgrounds, basketball courts, pavilions and boardwalks, Whitmer said. It also could improve regional trail systems, including in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Ottawa County and St. Clair County. The Democratic governor last month proposed allocating $250 million of $6.5 billion in discretionary federal COVID-19 funding to state parks. She also has called for using the aid to expand a tuition-free program, help businesses temporarily pay at least $15 an hour, and give front-line workers “hero pay” bonuses.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Foresters and landowners are concerned that a disease that kills oak trees is creeping farther north in the state. The mighty oak is one of the most abundant trees in Minnesota. Oak wilt was been around for decades and has been confirmed in 40 of the state’s counties. But the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is now finding cases farther north than ever before, most recently in Crow Wing County, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I consider oak wilt to be really one of the top forest health issues in this part of the state, in particular because we have so many red and pin oaks up in this area,” said Rachael Dube, a DNR forest health specialist in Brainerd. Dube counted 40 oak trees around her home in Brainerd, less than 10 miles from where oak wilt was recently confirmed. “I talked with people not only that have had (trees with) oak wilt but are concerned about getting it. And it’s an issue that people are starting to become really passionate about in the area,” Dube said. The non-native disease slowly kills the leaves of an oak tree and, eventually, the tree itself. It spreads through its root systems and through open tree pores. People accelerate the spread when they prune oaks and carry infected firewood across the state, foresters said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The nation’s leading infectious disease expert says despite being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, if he were in the country’s least-vaccinated state, he’d don a face mask. Along with the Magnolia State’s fully vaccinated rate of 31%, falling far behind the nation’s average of 47%, Dr. Anthony Fauci is concerned about the rapidly spreading delta variant of the coronavirus. “I might want to go the extra mile to be cautious enough to be sure that I get the extra added layer of protection, even though the vaccines themselves are highly effective,” Fauci told Chuck Todd during NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The delta variant has quickly gained prominence in the U.S., making up 10% of new COVID-19 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Federal health officials have noted available vaccines are effective against the delta variant, but as Fauci put it, “nothing is 100%.” Since Gov. Tate Reeves lifted Mississippi’s county-by-county mask mandates in March, daily COVID-19 cases had been on the decline. But within the past two weeks, the state health department’s public database shows cases rising again. “It feels very reminiscent of where we were in an early part of the pandemic,” State Epidemiologist Paul Byers said last week. “It feels like we’re in the same situation now with the delta variant.”\n\nMissouri\n\nNixa: As the coronavirus surges in the state, a mayor who imposed a mask requirement and other public safety measures is facing a recall vote, even though the requirements have long since expired. Nixa voters will have the option to recall Mayor Brian Steele at a special election set for Nov. 2. Steele, who was delegated emergency powers by the City Council to deal with the pandemic, enacted the mask ordinance in October and ended it April 30. The petition said Steele should be recalled for “individually and without regard to the citizens of Nixa, nor the vote of city council, enacting a mask mandate, and taking other actions detrimental to the city of Nixa, its economy and the health and welfare of the community in general.” Nixa, which has about 21,000 residents, is located about 10 miles south of Springfield, where hospitals are overflowing with COVID-19 patients, leading to a shortage of ventilators. Health officials are blaming low vaccination rates and the delta variant of the coronavirus for the surge. Just 44.8% of the state’s residents have received at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 54.9% nationally. And the rate is even lower in southwest Missouri. Christian County, where Nixa is located, has a vaccine rate of 35.2%. Some nearby counties have rates in the teens.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: The warriors and their galloping horses kicked up dust as they circled the field to finish off the last of Gen. George Armstrong Custer’s men as onlookers watched during the Battle of Little Bighorn reenactment late last month. “This has been one of our most successful days; it was a gift,” organizer Jimmy Real Bird said in an interview with The Billings Gazette. “The land brings people out. It is like a breath of fresh air to see its history.” The reenactment, which took place on the 145th anniversary of Custer’s Last Stand, is a part of the annual Crow Native Days, a celebration that attracts thousands of people from across the country to see rodeos, reenactment and more around Crow Agency. The festival, sidelined last year due to COVID-19, is giving a much-needed boost to the morale and local economy of the area. “Today is a good day to be here; today is a good day to be Crow,” Chairman Frank White Clay said during an address to veterans June 25. White Clay noted that the tribe has had struggles with the pandemic. It halted any chance of meeting in person for over a year while also killing tribal members at a higher rate than the Montana average. Those dark days, he said, have passed. The warriors consisted of young Crow Tribe riders who played braves from the Crow, Sioux and Cheyenne tribes.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: A former Junior Miss Nebraska is hoping the blankets she made will provide comfort and warmth to children who may be experiencing difficulties in their lives. Megan Olson’s project began last December when the 21-year-old made fleece blankets for several friends, the Norfolk Daily News reports. “It became an obsession,” said the 21-year-old, who is studying to be a veterinary technician at Northeast Community College in Norfolk. The blankets are made from two layers of fleece that are fringed around the edges. The top and bottom strips are knotted together, which keeps the two layers in place. Olson was drawn to the project for a number of reasons. “I wanted to make something useful,” she told the Daily News. The blankets also brought back memories. “I remembered one of the blankets I had as a child when I broke my arm,” she said. Olson recently donated 12 blankets to Project Linus through Tara Brtek, a counselor at Washington Elementary School in Norfolk. Project Linus, which donates new blankets to children in need, is named for the character by the same name in the Peanuts cartoon who carries a blanket everywhere he goes. Olson said some of the blankets she made will be used by students at the school, while others may be given to students to take home.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is proposing rounding up more than 500 wild burros in the desert north of Lake Mead. The feral donkeys are stripping the land of vegetation and could die off if the population isn’t managed along the Arizona-Nevada line, the agency said. It wants to gather most of them to offer up for adoption. If the plan is approved, the government also plans to temporarily sterilize other burros and round up the animals at other points over the next decade, the Las Vegas Sun reports. No date for the roundup has been set. It could be years away or as early as this fall if a historic drought in the West dries up enough plants and grass to force starvation conditions, agency documents indicate. The proposal also includes removing a small herd of wild horses in the same area. The Bureau of Land Management estimates at least 554 burros and 36 horses live in the Lake Mead Complex, an expanse of rangeland covering about 291 square miles. It’s one of the biggest herds in Nevada. The agency manages the complex along with the National Park Service. The area can support up to 98 burros and no horses, Bureau of Land Management officials said. The animals reproduce exponentially and have few predators, and their demands mean food and water sources aren’t sustainable, according to the agency.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Up to 2,000 Dartmouth-Hitchcock employees will keep working remotely in some capacity after the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. Brenda Blair of Dartmouth-Hitchcock told the Valley News that positions will be affected at least part of the time in human resources, information technology, finance and clinical secretary services. The total includes about 13% of the health system’s employees overall and almost 20% of workers at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon. “It is increasing our ability to recruit and retain our staff,” Blair said. “We are employing workers outside of Vermont and New Hampshire.” She characterized the current shift as one from “remote by necessity,” which the health system adopted in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, to “remote by design,” in which Dartmouth-Hitchcock has taken the time to think through how best to approach remote work. Blair said some employees will work from home full time, while others will rotate in-person days with other co-workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: The state has set aside $4 million in its recently enacted budget for long-needed repairs to the Wildwood boardwalk, one of the Jersey Shore’s main attractions. But city officials say the walkway needs work that could cost $60 million. Gov. Phil Murphy visited the resort town Sunday to describe the aid and meet with local officials, the Press of Atlantic City reports. “It’s an iconic boardwalk, by any measure,” Murphy said. “It’s America’s boardwalk, and the extent to which we get this thing rebuilt properly has a huge positive impact on the boardwalk, on the businesses on the boardwalk (and) on tourism.” The Democratic governor had visited the walkway in April 2020 after a storm damaged sections of the boardwalk near the Convention Center. But before that storm hit, city officials had said the walkway was overdue for an overhaul. Mayor Pete Byron told the newspaper that the total cost of the work could reach $60 million but that Wildwood had come up with a partial plan that would cost $35 million. The newspaper said Murphy did not address a question about his veto of a $56 million earmark for the Wildwood boardwalk in 2019.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The city is tapping into federal grant money and other funding to pilot an initiative aimed at getting more children to ride their bicycles and walk to school. Students at Nina Otero Community School and El Camino Real Academy in Santa Fe are among those receiving bike safety lessons this summer as part of the citywide effort, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. A $300,000 grant and matching money from the Santa Fe Metropolitan Planning Organization will pay for staffing and a consultant, who will help build staff and volunteer groups to keep bike safety a top priority. Funding will also be spent on experts in fields like geographic information systems so recommendations can be made on improvements to trails, sidewalks and crosswalks around town. “We’ll be looking into improvements on campus areas,” said Tim Rogers, Conservation Trust trails program manager and Safe Routes coordinator. “We have all been working primarily on the south side.” Safe Routes to School initiatives span the nation, emphasizing pedestrian and bike safety for kids getting to school. Rogers said a Safe Routes program in Las Cruces is possibly the only comprehensive program in the state. A 2015 study showed the longer Safe Routes initiatives were in place, the more kids started walking and biking to schools.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city that never sleeps could live up to its name under an agency’s proposal for 24-hour entertainment districts where revelers can party all night. The city’s Office of Nightlife is recommending that officials identify areas with low residential density “where a limited 24-hour program might be tested.” The recommendation is contained in a 160-page report issued this month by the nightlife office. “Cities around the world are expanding the way institutions and businesses can operate at night, as limitations on closing hours have pushed latenight activity to unlicensed venues, sometimes coming into conflict with residential uses,” the report says. “Uniform closing hours for nightlife businesses can result in groups of people congregating in the street, elevating tensions between patrons and residents.” The report notes that Amsterdam began allowing nightlife venues to apply for 24-hour licenses in 2012, “developing strict criteria for potential applicants that included cultural significance, accessibility to public transportation, and locations without ‘inconvenience to local residents.’ ” New York City’s Office of Nightlife, part of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, was created in 2017 to serve as a liaison between nightlife operators and city enforcement agencies.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: A new museum will house wooden boats that plied the Currituck Sound when world-class duck hunting and bass fishing were livelihoods for local watermen and passions for the wealthy. The 10,000 square-foot, $4.3 million Currituck Maritime Museum in the shadow of the Currituck Beach Lighthouse is set to open next week, The Virginian-Pilot reports. “It tells of a way of life that’s not around anymore,” said Currituck County native Wilson Snowden. Currituck is a Native American word meaning “land of the wild goose.” For about a century from the mid-1800s, the Currituck Sound was renowned for duck hunting when millions of waterfowl wintered there. In the mid-20th century, the sound also was known for excellent largemouth bass fishing. The bounty created industries that served as the beginning of tourism in the area. Plush hunt clubs sprung up along the sound to meet the demand of wealthy industrialists who came to hunt and fish and hired locals to guide them. Men became experts at building boats and carving decoys. Before federal law prohibited market duck hunting in the early 1900s, watermen would shoot hundreds and sell them to be shipped to restaurants. A single canvasback duck sold for $6 in 1900, equal to $157 in today’s money, according to a museum exhibit.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: About 125 soldiers from a National Guard unit based in the city will be sent to the U.S. border with Mexico later this year for an undetermined amount of time, the North Dakota Guard said Tuesday. The soldiers from the 957th Engineer Company are expected to begin the deployment this fall, the military said. Mike Nowatzki, a spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum, said the Department of the Army made the request through the National Guard Bureau. “We have monitored the ongoing crisis at the southern border and have responded to the request by sending North Dakota National Guard Soldiers to support the efforts to secure our border,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Nowatzki said the deployment is being funded by the federal government. Burgum is among a growing list of Republican governors promising to send law enforcement officers to Texas. Heads of state from Arkansas, Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have all committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. In South Dakota, a billionaire Republican donor is paying $1 million to help defray the cost. Nowatzki said he was not aware of any private donors who had offered to offset the cost of the deployment of North Dakota National Guard troops.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it would not consider an appeal over the firing of a white police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice outside a Cleveland recreation center in 2014. The appeal was filed in April by the Cleveland Police Patrolment’s Association on behalf former Officer Timothy Loehmann. Cleveland fired Loehmann in 2017 not for killing Tamir, who was Black, but for providing false information on his job application. An arbitrator and a county judge upheld his firing. A state appellate court earlier this year dismissed Loehmann’s appeal, citing the union’s failure to serve notice on outside attorneys hired by the city. Loehmann, a rookie, shot Tamir within seconds of a cruiser skidding to a stop near a gazebo where the child had been sitting. Officers responded to a call from a man who said someone was waving a gun around. The man also told a dispatcher that the gun could be a fake and that the person might be a juvenile. A state grand jury declined to indict Loehmann in Tamir’s shooting, and in December federal authorities announced they would not bring federal criminal charges. “I am glad that Loehmann will never have a badge and gun in Cleveland again,” Tamir’s mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A research project at Oklahoma State University aims to determine whether livestock producers can use virtual fence systems to control herds of cattle. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded researchers at the university more than $800,000 for the study in June. Researchers began studying the technology in February 2020 and have collaborated with California-based company Vence, which is developing the fencing systems, officials said. Thanks to the EPA grant, which provides funding for the next three years of the project, researchers say they’re ready to study the technology until the cows come home. “We’re ready now to move into some more long-term studies,” said Dr. Kevin Wager, an OSU professor who is leading the study. “It’s going to be a good project, and I’m really excited about it.” In some ways, the fences are similar to invisible fences for dogs and other domestic animals. Using a virtual fencing system, ranchers can set up boundary lines to contain cattle within pastures or specific parts of pastures. Cattle wear GPS-equipped collars around their necks that emit a sound when they are near a virtual boundary line. If cattle don’t heed the sound, they’ll receive an electric shock. The goal, researchers say, is to teach cattle to listen to the sound and turn around.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon Department of Agriculture has filed a temporary emergency rule requiring all mink ranchers to vaccinate their animals against COVID-19. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said officials are looking to stop the coronavirus from mutating in mink and being passed back to humans. “ODA is taking the necessary precautions to reduce the risk of infection in captive mink, as well as reduce the risk of potential mutation of the virus and the potential for virus transmission back to humans,” Scholz said in a statement. The state has given ranchers until the end of August to complete the inoculations. A 2020 report by Fur Commission USA counts 11 permitted mink farms in Oregon with an estimated 438,327 animals. That makes Oregon the fourth-largest pelt-producing state behind Wisconsin, Utah and Idaho. Eight of Oregon’s mink farms are in Marion County, with two in Clatsop County and one in Linn County.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The head of a county child welfare agency in northeastern Pennsylvania was charged Tuesday with ordering workers to falsely close files on allegations of child abuse and neglect in response to public reports of a significant backlog of cases. The state attorney general’s office accused Joanne G. Van Saun, 58, of Dallas, Pennsylvania, with child endangerment and obstruction for ending investigations in order to clear the backlog at the Luzerne County Department of Children and Youth Services. She resigned from her position as agency director Friday. Van Saun’s attorney, Patrick A. Casey, declined comment. In court documents, investigators said Van Saun set up a team led by three senior aides to address a backlog of nearly 1,400 cases that was reported by The Citizens’ Voice of Wilkes-Barre in 2017. “Van Saun told the three leaders that she wanted the backlog eradicated immediately, and that she did not care how they did it,” according to the probable cause affidavit used to charge her. Investigators said people who worked under Van Saun described her as a bully and tyrant. Authorities claim more than 200 referrals from the state-run ChildLine hotline were improperly at her direction in May 2017, including reports of an adult telling children to kill themselves and a 100-pound child still using a diaper.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the more charities in the state stand to benefit under a program announced Tuesday by Gov. Daniel McKee. Under the COVID-19 Vaccination Incentive Fund, for every 5,000 additional people who get a first dose of a vaccine, an increasing amount of money will be granted to Rhode Island nonprofits. It starts with $100,000 after the first 5,000 shots, up to $200,000 for the fifth round of 5,000 shots, officials said. Other states have vaccine incentive programs, but they usually benefit individuals in the form of cash prizes or scholarships. The $750,000 program is funded by $500,000 from the state and $250,000 from the Rhode Island Foundation. “We did intentional research and reflection to create a program that celebrates the spirit of Rhode Island, sustains the importance of getting all Rhode Islanders vaccinated over time, and provides support back to the organizations that are getting our most vulnerable neighbors through the pandemic,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. Eligible nonprofits based in the state can apply starting immediately through the Rhode Island Foundation’s website. Applications will be accepted through July 30. Eligible organizations must provide services or direct assistance in response to the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A group that considers pay raises for the leaders of state agencies has agreed to give tens of thousands of dollars in pay increases to five directors. There was only one vote Thursday against the raises by the Agency Head Salary Commission, with most members agreeing the extra pay is needed to keep talented leaders with increased competition from private industries, The State newspaper reports. “Unfortunately we have been behind the curve on salaries in South Carolina,” said House Majority Leader Gary Simrill, R-Rock Hill, who acknowledged the increases would draw public scrutiny. “It’s difficult to hire and retain talent.” The raises range from 19% to 48% on salaries that now range from $245,000 to nearly $300,000. Secretary of Transportation Christy Hall got a 19% bump to $298,000 a little over a year after getting a 32% raise. “I use Secretary Hall as a prime example of a person who understands an agency from top to bottom,” Simrill said. The lone vote against the raises came from Senate President Harvey Peeler. The Republican from Gaffney suggested the raises could be spread out over three years as he pointed out that the amount of the increase for some leaders was more than the yearly pay for some state employees, while still saying the directors had “earned their pay.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Protesters climbed a grain mill downtown and hung a giant upside-down American flag on the building to protest mistreatment of American Indians. The Rapid City Journal reports the “Fourth of You Lie” protest began at a park Sunday evening. Candi Brings Plenty, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, read a list of demands that included forming releasing police disciplinary records, calling for external reviews of police brutality allegations and creating an American Indian commission. Dozens of protesters marched through the streets. The protest was intended to end at the Pennington County jail but continued to the Dakota Mill and Grain Silo after a group of protesters broke off and headed there to hang the flag, which was emblazoned with the words “Land Back.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Three fire lookout towers are among seven properties across the state recently named to the National Register of Historic Places, officials said. The Tennessee Historical Commission said Friday that the locations were deemed worthy of making the list of important cultural resources in the U.S. The commission said the Big Hill Fire Lookout Tower in Marion County, the Twinton Fire Lookout Tower in Overton County, and the Chuck Swan Fire Lookout Tower in Union County have been named to the register. The towers, which range from 60 to 100 feet tall, allowed rangers to monitor fire activity more easily than they would on the ground. Tennessee once had 208 lookout towers, but little more than half remain, the commission said. Also placed on the the register were the T-201 Aircraft Hangar in Coffee County, the Overton Park Court Apartments in Shelby County, and Beck Knob Cemetery and the Price-Evans Foundry, both in Hamilton County.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday demanded that the Texas Public Utility Commission take immediate action to shore up the state’s troubled electrical grid, targeting renewable energy and blaming it for some of the problems. In a letter to the commission, Abbott directed the board to take steps to increase the amount of electricity produced in the state. Specifically, Abbott told the utility commission to work to provide incentives for the construction and maintenance of natural gas, coal and nuclear power. Further, Abbott directed his appointees at the utility commission to take aim at wind and solar power, which have been criticized for their perceived unpredictability in producing power, even as failures at natural gas plants played a significant role in power failures during the February freeze and in last month’s conservation call. Abbott directed the utility commission to begin assessing “reliability costs,” which could take the form of fines, to power plants “that cannot guarantee their own availability, such as wind or solar power,” the letter says. “When they fail to do so, those generators should shoulder the costs of that failure,” Abbott’s letter says. “Failing to do so creates an uneven playing field between non-renewable and renewable energy generators and creates uncertainty of available generation in” the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say a rare animal spotted in a nearby neighborhood likely has been on the move in search of a new place to live. A home doorbell camera caught the wolverine on video Thursday in west Layton, about 15 miles west of Salt Lake City, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Utah Division of Wildlife Resources officials believe it was the same animal seen on nearby Antelope Island in early May. Wolverines have been spotted in Utah only six times. The last time before this year was in 2016. The largest members of the weasel family, wolverines look like a combination of a skunk and bear and reach 40 pounds. They are rare in the Rocky Mountain region and typically found in high mountain areas. Males usually establish a territory with one to three females, leaving two other males on average to rove in search of their own territories, said wildlife biologist and Wolverine Foundation board member Jeff Copeland. “In doing so they can end up in some really odd places we’ve seen over the years,” Copeland said. Wolverines often don’t shy away from people but aren’t dangerous, just naturally curious, he said. Wolverines declined in the U.S. before beginning to rebound in the 1960s.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Statehouse opened to the public Tuesday after being closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. People can tour the Montpelier landmark again, but guided tours won’t be resuming yet. Visitors will be able to take self-guided tours on their phones. Vaccinations are recommended but not required. While visitors are allowed, lawmakers are still figuring out how they will continue to conduct the people’s business after the pandemic. During the pandemic, lawmakers held video meetings. “We were able to flip the lights off pretty quick. I think that’s a testament to the flexibility of the Legislature and the public,” Capitol Police Chief Matthew Romei told WCAX-TV. “But flipping it back on is going to take a little bit of work.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Officials in the capital city plan to resume evicting families from public housing units for the first time in nearly two years if they have failed to pay their rent. The Times-Dispatch reports that over 800 households in units overseen by the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority had entered repayment plans for delinquent balances totaling about $1 million as of mid-June. Nearly 700 of them had fallen behind on those agreements, according to a housing official. The authority, which oversees roughly 3,700 units, had agreed to halt evictions in 2019 under pressure from tenants’ advocates. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a government moratorium protected tenants from getting evicted. Households that are more than two months behind on their rent could face eviction in August, but the housing authority said it will not pursue cases against tenants who are in the pipeline for rent relief.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A vandal smashed 14 windows at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Spokane Valley over the weekend. Paul Dillon, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, said the vandalism occurred about 12:30 p.m. Saturday, and a suspect was arrested on site soon after. Dillon said multiple witnesses observed the incident, which was recorded by security cameras, The Spokesman-Review reports. “He collected a bunch of rocks and started smashing windows in the building, including every front window and the main clinic entrance,” Dillon said of the suspect. Dillon noted the vandalism occurred the day after a court hearing was conducted in which a Spokane County judge heard arguments in the lawsuit the local Planned Parenthood organization filed against the Church at Planned Parenthood, an abortion protest group, alleging its frequent religious services and noisy demonstrations held outside the Spokane clinic have interfered with treatment and intimidated patients and staff. On Friday, Planned Parenthood sought a permanent injunction against the group. Dillon speculated that Saturday’s vandalism might be connected to Friday’s court action.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has crossed the threshold of 1 million residents receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The milestone announced by Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday equates to 64.5% of all residents ages 12 and up. Nearly 54%, or about 837,000, of residents 12 and up have received both vaccines. Justice acknowledged at a news conference that the state is “in our infancy” with the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus and that the odds are “astronomical” that there will be substantially more cases of it among unvaccinated residents. According to state health data, 12 cases of the delta variant, which was first detected in India and now has been found in more than 80 countries, have been reported in West Virginia. There have been 2,901 deaths from the virus in the state since the start of the pandemic. “If you’re out there in West Virginia, and you’re not vaccinated today, what’s the downside?” Justice said. “If all of us were vaccinated, do you not believe that less people would die? If you’re not vaccinated, you’re part of the problem rather than part of the solution.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: As many as one-third of the state’s gray wolves likely died at the hands of humans in the months after the federal government announced it was ending legal protections, according to a study released Monday. Poaching and a February hunt that far exceeded kill quotas were largely responsible for the drop-off, University of Wisconsin scientists said, though some other scientists say more direct evidence is needed for some of the calculations. Adrian Treves, an environmental studies professor, said his team’s findings should raise doubts about having another hunting season this fall and serve notice to wildlife managers in other states with wolves. Removing federal protections “opens the door for antagonists to kill large numbers in short periods, legally and illegally,” Treves and two colleagues said in a paper published by the journal PeerJ. “The history of political scapegoating of wolves may repeat itself.” The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dropped gray wolves in the Lower 48 states from its list of endangered and threatened species in January, shortly before former President Donald Trump left office. Agency biologists have long argued that the predator has recovered from persecution that nearly wiped it out by the mid-20th century.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A man who asked a sheriff’s dispatcher why he hadn’t been arrested soon found himself in handcuffs. The 62-year-old called the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office on June 24 to ask why he hadn’t been arrested after deputies raided his house the previous day. Asked why he should be arrested, the man said meth use, according to Undersheriff Quentin Reynolds. The man also told a dispatcher 10 young men were following him. Nobody had raided the man’s house or was planning to arrest him, Reynolds said. After the call, a deputy spotted the man driving and followed when he pulled off the road, the Gillette News Record reports. The man allegedly told the deputy he had used methamphetamine a day and a half before and was still high. He did poorly on sobriety tests and was arrested for driving under the influence of a controlled substance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/06/21/clint-black-kite-fest-coast-brewfest-portland-lincoln-city-oregon-events-what-to-do/103076136/", "title": "Clint Black, kite fest on coast, plus pair of garden tours", "text": "Heather Rayhorn\n\nStatesman Journal\n\n1 Salem, Home base\n\nThursday, June 29\n\nScience Night for Adults: Willamette University Chemistry will present, Tony Smiley (The Loop Ninja) will perform music, plus food from The Kitchen on Court Street, 6:30 to 10 p.m., Gilbert House Children’s Museum, 116 Marion St. NE.

Booming music festivals downtown. Sticky afternoons at the Iowa State Fair.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Des Moines without them. But the coronavirus outbreak spreading across the state has already forced the cancellation or postponement of several of central Iowa's traditional spring and summer events, and is threatening others.\n\nIt's a blow to a community that packs the warmer half of the year with festivals, fairs and other outdoor gatherings.\n\n\"Des Moines has this rich culture of going out and doing things in the summer,\" said Kristen Meyers, an event planner who works with multiple festivals. \"I think that we take every sunny, beautiful day that we can because half the year is cold and dreary.\"\n\nCatch Des Moines, the metro's convention and visitors bureau, estimates canceled or delayed conventions and sporting events over the next few months already have resulted in the loss of more than $35 million in expected revenue for the community. That figure doesn't include gatherings like concerts and festivals, which Catch Des Moines does not track.\n\nThe economic benefits of hosting a gathering go far beyond venue rental fees and tourism taxes. On its own, the World Pork Expo, held in early June, has a $16.3 million impact on the community, according to Catch Des Moines President Greg Edwards. But on March 31, the organizers canceled the event due to coronavirus concerns — and that means some 20,000 people associated with one of the Midwest's biggest industries won't be making their annual pilgrimage to the capital city.\n\n\"You always have to keep in mind the ripple effect that this has. These events are more than just events,\" Edwards said. \"Visitors eat in our restaurants, they stay in our hotels, they spend money in our shops.\"\n\nFor massive summer staples, that ripple effect is likely to be even larger — and the consequences of cancellations more far-reaching. The Iowa State Fair, one of the largest and longest-running events in the state each summer, hosts hundreds of food and merchandise vendors and regularly draws over a million visitors over its 11-day run, making it a formidable economic ecosystem on its own.\n\nState Fair CEO and Manager Gary Slater estimated that organizers will need to make a decision on whether to hold the fair by early to mid-June.\n\nThe increasingly barren schedule of upcoming events in Des Moines is a graphic illustration of the uncertainty of the next few months. Most late spring and early summer events already have been delayed or canceled due to the possibility that social distancing will continue through the start of festival season. Meanwhile, large end-of-summer festivities are in limbo, their organizers unable to make firm commitments as they face an unpredictable future.\n\n'Just too soon'\n\nNothing says summer in Des Moines like the Downtown Farmers' Market. Each Saturday, it hosts nearly 300 vendors selling fresh produce, crafts and coffee. The market, which typically starts the first weekend in May, usually boasts 25,000 visitors.\n\nBut with social distancing guidelines in effect until April 30 in Iowa, which advise against holding gatherings of more than 10 people, the massive weekly street party is off \"until restrictions are lifted,\" according to a statement on the market's website.\n\nCourtney Shaw, vice president of communications for the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said market organizers are working with the farmers and craftspeople waiting to sell their wares.\n\nIt's the same story for the Drake Relays, a late April tradition. The track competition and its related festivities — the Beautiful Bulldogs contest, Grand Blue Mile and Drake Road Races — were postponed indefinitely in mid-March.\n\nAnd a look through the Wells Fargo Arena website reveals a list of canceled and postponed events through April. Coronavirus has affected everything from the Harlem Globetrotters to Michael Bublé. Cher, whose April 16 show would have been one of the biggest of the year, now won't appear until Sept. 28.\n\nThe next event still scheduled is a Joe Rogan stand-up comedy show on May 15. And there's still no word about Elton John's long sold-out \"Farewell Yellow Brick Road\" show, scheduled for June 11.\n\nEven some events that take place in the early summer, after current social distancing guidelines end, have been rescheduled.\n\nCelebrAsian, a two-day Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage festival that normally kicks off the summer festival season, and Capital City Pride Fest, a weekend celebration of LGBTQ culture, have moved their festivities to later in the year.\n\nDan Jansen, president of Capital City Pride, said his team has been watching federal and state guidelines while taking hints from other Pride festivals across the nation. The Pride Fest is now scheduled for mid-July, a month later than its original date. Jansen said the group has another fallback plan if the July target doesn't work.\n\n\"Ultimately, we are a community organization. We do want to ensure the safety of the community,\" Jansen said. \"But we also want to enable the fact that, at some point, the community will want to be together in person to celebrate.\"\n\nNu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, said CelebrAsian's Memorial Day weekend date was \"just too soon\" to safely gather a crowd. She said that while organizers are aware of an increase of anti-Asian racism in the U.S. based on the coronavirus' origin in China, concerns about xenophobia did not prompt the delay.\n\n\"If anything, it's the opposite. We definitely want to show our strength and resiliency, and that Iowans are better than that,\" Huynh said.\n\nHuynh and several other event organizers said they were struggling to organize event sponsors as local and national businesses deal with the pandemic.\n\nEmily Steele, an organizer for the nonprofit musical festival 80/35, said corporate sponsorships began to fall off as the coronavirus crisis ramped up. The combination of that and uncertainty that Iowans would purchase tickets led 80/35 to cancel its July downtown gathering of Iowa and national performers.\n\n\"We just couldn't guarantee that we would have the funds from the ticket sales to secure the acts,\" Steele said. \"And on top of that, knowing that corporate sponsors, they're also going through some financial instability or some questioning of if they can give away funds. No one really said that, but it got quiet.\"\n\nLater events: Wait and see\n\nSeveral summer staples remain in limbo ⁠— not yet canceled or delayed, but with only so long before decisions must be made.\n\nAnne Lawrie, marketing director for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, said there will be a decision April 15 about whether the nation's largest annual bike tour will happen as scheduled in mid-July. There's a complex checklist of things to organize, from merchandising to logistics along the route.\n\nRAGBRAI brings thousands of cyclists together to ride, party and camp in close proximity to one another for an entire week. Lawrie said that, if the current prohibitions on mass gatherings stay in effect, RAGBRAI will be forced to comply and cancel.\n\nThe factors challenging RAGBRAI go beyond crowd size: The financial strain of coronavirus on host towns may also influence the decision. The planned RAGBRAI route has overnight stops in six towns across the state, each of which must be able to feed and offer accommodations to the riders.\n\n\"We're also looking at the community's ability to plan and put on the events from a fundraising perspective, from a food and vendor perspective and from a housing perspective,\" Lawrie said. \"Can we raise the money we need to raise in order to pay for the events in each of those towns? That's a community decision.\"\n\nIowa's Ride, a new, similar ride scheduled for the week before RAGBRAI, also is waiting for the situation to clarify before making a call.\n\n\"Like most other events, we are carefully monitoring the evolving situation of COVID-19,\" Iowa's Ride Director TJ Juskiewicz wrote in an email. \"Our top priority is the safety of the public, our riders, support drivers, volunteers and others that would work the event.\"\n\nHinterland, the eclectic annual music festival in St. Charles, is also waiting and watching. Festival owner Sam Summers said he's closely monitoring news on the virus, but he said his confidence level is \"very, very high\" that it will be safe to hold the three-day festival in late July.\n\nAnd then there's central Iowa's crown jewel: the Iowa State Fair, which is scheduled for Aug. 13-23. Slater, the CEO and manager of the fair, said the staff is proceeding under the assumption that the fair will happen.\n\n\"It's too early to speculate about August,\" Slater said. Cancellations for May and June events are understandable, he said, \"but things in July and August, it's not time to make those decisions based on the data and information that we have.\"\n\nSlater estimated that organizers would make a decision on holding the fair in the next 60 to 75 days. He said fair organizers and vendors need time to order merchandise to sell, and June is the longest many of them can wait before shipping times would interfere with business.\n\n\"We're just trying to delay things to that drop-dead date of, you know, if you have to have tickets printed in order to sell them at the front gate, what is the last date you could order them and get them here in time for the fair?\" Slater said.\n\nThe precedents for canceling the fair are a reminder of the scope of the global pandemic. In the 166 years since the first fair, the only times it hasn't been held are during the four years of World War II and during the Spanish-American War in 1898, when it also faced competition from the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair in Omaha.\n\nGathering in a post-coronavirus world\n\nEvent organizers said that even if the pandemic subsides before the warm weather does, they aren't sure how an event following months of social distancing will go. But they all agreed it wouldn't be business as usual.\n\n\"I truly believe the world will not be the same when we're out of the pandemic and the crisis mode,\" Slater said. \"The world will have changed; we all will have changed; you will have changed, as I.\"\n\nSlater said the State Fair would consider limiting crowds inside buildings and providing more hand sanitizer. Several other event organizers brought up similar mitigation strategies.\n\nBut even with hand sanitizer and a new focus on public health, attendance at large events is hard to predict. Iowans might be excited to socialize, but they may also emerge from isolation shy of traveling and spooked by crowds.\n\nEdwards of Catch Des Moines looked on the bright side, saying hesitation around travel may be a boon for central Iowa. Tourists can visit by car, rather than taking a plane.\n\n\"There's going to be still some hesitancy out there from people all across the world on traveling,\" he said. \"So many of our visitors do come from a 250-, 300-mile radius around Des Moines. So that's where we can really make an impact of letting people know, 'Hey, we're open. We've got great things happening here.'\"\n\nAnd after months indoors and with minimal social contact, perhaps festivals — even if they're a few months later than usual — will be exactly what Iowa needs. Meyers, an organizer working on Pride Fest and 80/35, thinks so.\n\n\"For me, working in festivals is a way of bringing so many different kinds of people together and giving them a chance — and I'm sure we're all really excited to do this — to get out of their house and stop playing video games.\"\n\nStatus of some major spring and summer events\n\nMission Creek Festival, April 1-4: canceled\n\nDrake Relays, April 22-25: delayed\n\nDowntown Farmers' Market, May 2: delayed\n\nCelebrasian, May 22-23: delayed\n\nWorld Pork Expo, June 3-5: canceled\n\nCapital City Pride Fest, June 12-14: delayed\n\nDes Moines Arts Festival, June 26-28: still on\n\n80/35, July 10-11: canceled\n\nIowa's Ride, July 12-18: still on\n\nThe Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, July 19-25: still on\n\nItalian-American Heritage Festival of Iowa: July 24-25: canceled\n\nHinterland, July 31- Aug. 2: still on\n\nIowa State Fair, Aug. 13-23: still on\n\nThis article has been edited to show that the Des Moines Arts Festival is still scheduled to be held June 26-28.\n\nKatie Akin is a retail reporter for the Register.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“Our goal was to make accessibility and seating better in the Grandstand,” said Gary Slater, Iowa State Fair CEO. “And the stage bigger, to help the folks that are going to the concert … have a higher production, higher quality show.”\n\nAttending an upcoming Grandstand show? Here’s what you’ll see.\n\nAdded space\n\nIn previous years, the track would overflow between sets with concertgoers trying to snag a beer or a tour T-shirt. Lines at capacity shows would often wrap around track bleachers and into the Grandstand, making it difficult to navigate to a bathroom or concession stand.\n\nEliminating the track, Slater said, creates more space between Grandstand bleachers and what the fair calls “Prairie Meadows Plaza” seating — roughly 24 feet separates the Grandstand and first row of ground-level chairs versus 10 feet in previous years — to help traffic flow.\n\nMore space means more people. New seating upgrades Grandstand capacity from about 10,600 people to roughly 14,500, increasing plaza seating from about 900 to 4,000.\n\nAdd in standing room only tickets and Grandstand crowds could reach 15,000 this summer. To compare, a cappella group Pentatonix brought the largest crowd in 2017, a total of 10,643.\n\nMore on Iowa State Fair music:\n\nSeating options\n\nThe renovated plaza offers two seating sections:\n\nA pit section, the closest to the stage. This section comes with chairs for some performances, like Reba McEntire, Earth, Wind & Fire or Jim Gaffigan, and offers standing room only tickets for shows with a younger demographic, like Thomas Rhett, Florida Georgia Line or Old Dominion.\n\n17 rows of chairs offered at every show, elevated above the pit and closest to the Grandstand.\n\nThe fair fits more concertgoers into the plaza during standing room only pit shows, creating a larger capacity for some concerts.\n\nMore:Country star Carrie Underwood returning to Des Moines in 2019\n\nBigger stage\n\nLimited staging caused tours to pass on playing the fair in previous years, Slater said. The fair previously fit artists on a 60 feet wide and 60 feet deep stage.\n\nThis year’s stage — the same dimensions fans saw when Metallica played the Iowa Speedway in Newton last summer, Slater said — measures 80 feet wide and 60 feet deep, allowing for bigger production.\n\nIt’ll be further away, though. The stage sits 178 feet north of the Grandstand, adding roughly 75 feet of distance when compared to previous years.\n\nFor concertgoers sitting in the east and west wings of the Grandstand, Slater said four new screens, each projecting a 16x9 picture, flank the stage — two on each side.\n\nA concert production team builds the stage each year, Slater said, but he hopes a permanent stage will be built in the next three or four years.\n\n“Ultimately, we wanted it to be a better experience for the fairgoer and to see (a concert) like they see it in Kansas City, Minneapolis or St. Louis,” Slater said.\n\nMore:Sturgill Simpson rips and roars an unforgettable show at Hinterland Music Festival\n\nConcessions and restrooms\n\nConcession tents on the east and west side of the plaza will sell beer, popcorn and other food and drink needs. The concessions located under the Grandstand remain open.\n\nThe fair no longer requires fans to buy drink and food tickets; Slater said cash and cards will be accepted.\n\nAbout $4 million of the $7.5 renovation price tag went into a new restroom facility, located on the west side of the plaza. Restrooms located under the Grandstand remain open, as well.\n\nFuture entertainment\n\nWhat happened to the tractor pull? It’ll return, Slater said.\n\nBy 2020 the fair plans to build an entertainment complex in the lot east of the Grandstand, space that would be home to tractor pulls, rodeos and a demolition derby.\n\nHe doesn’t rule out bringing racing to this complex — the fair disconnected racing in 2016 — but said it’s unlikely.\n\n“If you wanna see great racing where do you go?

In addition to the crown, Durr will take home $8,000 in scholarships, a $600 gift card, cowboy boots, diamond earrings, an Iowa State Fair Brick and, of course, a sash.\n\nFor the rest of the fair’s eight days, Durr will make appearances all over the grounds, participating in everything from measuring facial hair at the annual longest beard contest to presenting this year’s favorite fair food to handing out blue ribbons in the show ring.\n\nOutside of the fair, she’ll be tasked with representing Iowa’s annual get-together at events all across the state.

(This year’s queen, Mary Ann Fox, wove her way across the state, attending 76 county fairs and putting 12,000 miles on her car.)\n\nAs Durr, 18, was crowned, teary-eyed contestants swarmed her in a supportive group embrace. After five days of workshops, interviews and evaluations, she beat out 103 other girls for the title — yes, there are more fairs than counties in the state.\n\nDurr was inspired to run for State Fair queen this year by Kelsey Smith, who was not only the 2013 queen, but also her 4-H Clover Kids leader.\n\n“I looked up to her so much, and to the other County Fair queens, and I just wanted to be someone who little girls from my community could look up to, too,” she said after winning, shaking with excitement.\n\nRaised in New London, a small town in southeastern Iowa, Durr has loved agriculture her whole life, she says. But she had to join FFA in a neighboring district because her school didn’t have a chapter. As queen, she’s hoping to establish not only an FFA group, but a larger agriculture program at her alma mater.\n\n“These ladies have exuded elegance and pose not only in their county fairs, but they are also making a positive impact in their communities,” Hailey Swan, a former queen and one of the night’s emcees, said as she introduced this year’s class of contestants.\n\nWith a combined GPA of 3.76, the candidates included 90 4-H and 87 FFA members. Most of the women’s CVs read more like grocery lists than resumes. From honor students to student council presidents, the women represent all walks of life: Calhoun County’s entrant owns her own baking business. Dallas County’s competitor is a respite care provider. And Hancock County's nominee is the crew chief for her dad’s drag racing team.\n\nDurr was not only the president of her teen council, but also showed sheep and cattle, volunteered over 900 hours during high school and helps run one of the largest haunted houses in Iowa.\n\n“They’re smart. They’re talented. They’re committed. They are strong and they are leaders,” said Jerry Parkin, a longtime fair board member and the evening’s co-emcee.\n\n“They are the future,” he continued. “We need to make certain they have every possible opportunity to succeed.”\n\nDurr’s already got a solid plan for the long-term: She’s attending Des Moines Area Community College to study agriculture and business in the fall. And with Halloween season coming up, she’ll be busy at the haunted house.\n\nBut right then, she said, all she was really looking forward to was sharing a burger with her family.\n\nAdditional State Fair queen awards:\n\nFirst runner-up: Kiley Langley of Muscatine County. Second runner-up: Lillian Howe of Fremont County. Third runner-up: Taylor Bartholomew of Washington County.\n\nPersonality plus winner: Molly Chapman of Cedar County.Outstanding leadership: Maria McGowan of Woodbury County.\n\nCourtney Crowder, the Register's Iowa Columnist, traverses the state's 99 counties telling Iowans' stories.

But if you've got a lot of debt, and a lender who's leery about what's going on, it could end in a hurry,\" said Meirick, who owns Farmers Mill, a feed supply and elevator in northeast Iowa.\n\nHora, president of the Iowa Pork Producers Association, said the U.S. consumes only about 70 percent of the pork it produces. \"We've built an industry on those foreign market opportunities,\" said the Fort Dodge producer. \"We rely on those exports.\"\n\nThe men said things could change quickly. For example, African swine fever has been discovered in China. Already, 1,000 pigs have been destroyed.\n\nOr, if successful, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico could dramatically improve markets, they said.\n\n\"NAFTA could add $20 to $25 back\" to the price farmers can get for each pig, Halstead said.\n\nBakker, hanging out in the Swine Barn with friends Kelly Sheets of Nevada and Ben Schmaling of Prescott, agrees that the financial picture could change quickly.\n\n\"Farmers are patient by nature,\" he said. \"The futures markets might not look good today. But if NAFTA is renegotiated, we could be profitable again.\"\n\nThe big unknown, they said, is how long it might take for new deals to be negotiated.\n\n\"We'll be concerned if we walk into 2019 without some deals,\" Bakker said.\n\nMeirick, who lives in Protivin, said he's worried about the impact the ag downturn will have on rural communities, already hurting with corn and soybean prices cut more than half since hitting record highs in 2012.\n\n\"Farmers aren't buying extra machinery. They're not building new machine sheds. It's going to affect our local lumber dealer, our local equipment dealer, our local bank in our little town of 300 people. And the elevator where we're at,\" he said, adding that risks will grow the longer the tariffs last.\n\nVanderham, the Hillsboro dairy producer, said the fallout in the industry has hit \"big operations and small operations.\"\n\n\"Our prices have been so low, dairies are closing up across the country,\" the third-generation producer said, adding he's cutting costs to continue operating.\n\nWith long hours and uncertain profitability, dairy production is something people are born into, he said. \"When you hit these tough times, it's not an easy thing to give up. You don't know anything different,\" Vanderham said.\n\nHe hopes a $12 billion federal bailout will help. \"It's probably not going to make a huge difference. But anything and everything will help,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/wisconsin-family/2022/07/15/wisconsin-state-fair-guide-kids-families-strollers-food-rides/7501719001/", "title": "Wisconsin State Fair guide for kids, families: Strollers, food, rides", "text": "Wisconsin State Fair is arguably the most kid-friendly of the Milwaukee-area summer festivals — from tons of free stuff for kids to do to affordable food to enjoy to plenty of rides and games.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to State Fair this summer, here's what you need to know.\n\nHours, bag policies and stroller rentals\n\nDates for State Fair this year are Aug. 4-14, and general admission hours are 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Sundays through Wednesdays and 10 a.m.-midnight Thursdays through Saturdays.

In addition to the various animal barns and a few other smaller buildings, here are the main buildings you can hang out in while also shopping, eating or admiring exhibits.\n\nThe Expo Center is the biggest building. It has food, free samples, activities, official merch and aisle upon aisle of vendors.\n\nThe Original Cream Puff Pavilion is the central location for cream puffs.

There are more than 200 locations for food spread out among State Fair Park, with more than 800 dishes. Here are some kid-friendly must-haves.\n\nThe iconic Milk House is back after a two-year pandemic-induced hiatus. Located near the Expo Center, at South Grandstand Avenue at Main Street, this is where people can buy their favorite flavored milk for $1 a cup.\n\nCream puffs have been sold at the fair since 1924 and are State Fair's most popular food item. They can be bought at the Original Cream Puff pavilion by waiting in line inside the building (the line is long but typically fast-moving) or at the express window at the north end of the pavilion. There are also two to-go kiosks for quick cream puff-getting along Grandstand Avenue. A cream puff costs $5, with 3-packs available for $14 and 6-packs for $25.\n\nFor people who must have food-on-a-stick at the Fair, there are your typical corn dogs and caramel apples as well as deep fried candy bars, Oreos and Twinkies. Here are a few of the more unusual offerings.\n\nThe Brownie Waffle Stick is a Belgian waffle baked around a brownie with white chocolate chips, served on a stick, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup. This is at Waffle Chix on South Grandstand Avenue.\n\nAt Fried Fruit & Fried Olives on Grandstand Avenue between Main Street and Benno's Micro Alley, visitors can buy their choice of fruit, in a batter and then deep fried, and sprinkled with powdered sugar, cinnamon or chocolate.

They're for sale at the Milk House and are in Cow Pie Brownie and Cookies & Cream flavors.\n\nIt seems weird that this has never been offered before, but according to the State Fair, this is the first year frozen custard has been available. You can get vanilla or chocolate, in a cone, dish or with toppings to create a sundae, at Camp Bar at Central Avenue and Center Street (on the west side of Central Mall).\n\nA Gummy Bear brat, with a Gummy Bear infusion and topped with honey mustard and Gummy Bears, will be at Leadfoots Race Bar and Grill on Grandstand Ave. between Second St. and Benno's Micro Alley.\n\nCedar Crest (located in the Wisconsin Products Pavilion) is selling an ice cream flight — your choice of 4 different flavors.\n\nGiant pickles can be found at Pickle Barrel locations in the Expo Center and the Original Cream Puff Pavilion.\n\nRoasted corn on the cob is available at a few different locations, including the most popular — New Berlin Lions Club Corn Roast at Central Ave. & Second St.\n\nThe State Fair Food Finder is available on the Fair's website and allows you to search for your favorite food, or filter by many useful topics such as gluten-friendly, vegetarian items, kid's portions and Wisconsin staples.\n\nContact Amy Schwabe at (262) 875-9488 or amy.schwabe@jrn.com.

This longtime tradition would not be possible without the community support and volunteer efforts of so many. Hundreds of volunteers help coordinate logistics and run events and judging competitions, while generous sponsors and local businesses provide displays as well as financial and product donations.\n\nFor young people participating in projects through 4-H, FFA, and other youth organizations, the reward goes far beyond a colored ribbon. Youth gain leadership and lifelong skills and friendships as they exhibit and compete in any of the numerous projects. Skills and talents learned at Wisconsin fairs help prepare young people for a successful career.\n\nFairs are also a wonderful opportunity to connect urban and rural interests. Fairgoers can experience agriculture up close and ask questions, whether it’s about how livestock are cared for or how some of our favorite foods are grown. By offering fun and educational activities, agriculturalists are connecting with consumers to teach them about the source of their food, fuel, and fiber.\n\nRELATED: Your guide to this summer's festivals and fairs in Wisconsin\n\nWhile agriculture is still the mainstay of our Wisconsin fairs, there is truly a project for everyone, whether living on a farm, in the city, or at a home in the country. Projects range from photography, rocketry, and computers, to clothing, livestock, and foods.\n\nIn addition, fairs give us all a chance to taste the finest of Wisconsin foods. Each fair is famous for their own sweet treat, from milk shakes to cream puffs, as well as the traditional corn dog or pork on a stick. With live musical treats and adventurous carnival rides, fairs offer low-cost entertainment for the entire family close to home.\n\nThe largest fair of them all is the Wisconsin State Fair, running from August 2nd to the 12th. One of the State Fair’s biggest fans is Governor Walker. From taking a ride in Spin City to cheering on the bidders at the Governor’s Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction, the Governor is a huge proponent of the value of fairs to our youth.\n\nAs an exhibitor and an attendee, fairs have always been a big part of my life. I encourage you to join in the fun by planning a trip this summer to one of Wisconsin’s county and district fairs or the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis.

A lot of you don't care about the Iowa State Fair", "text": "My fellow Iowans, you’ve broken my deep-fried heart.\n\nThe irrefutable data from the scientific sampling conducted by our best pollsters has been tallied. And the truth hurts: You don’t love the Iowa State Fair nearly as much as I assumed.\n\nEvery summer we trot out the juggernaut top-line stats: The fair surpassed 1 million in total attendance for the first time in 2002. And in 2015, our 11-day collective stick-food binge and showcase of agricultural beasts set a new record of 1,117,398 fairgoers.\n\nThat’s more than one-third the population of Iowa that swarms to the east side of Des Moines, where local homeowners wave yardsticks and encourage them to trample and park on their lawns.\n\nBut a recent Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows that 40 percent of Iowans haven’t even bothered to attend the fair in the last decade.\n\nCombine that with the 15 percent who say they have attended only once since before Obama’s presidency, and that’s a majority of Iowans — 55 percent — showing a serious disinterest in our largest summertime ritual on the events calendar.\n\nMaybe I’m being too bleak: It’s true that 45 percent of Iowans have attended the fair more than once in the last decade. Nine percent of you are overachievers who have attended 10 or more times.\n\nBut I can just hear the fair haters cackling with delight. This poll no doubt is sweet vindication to those for whom the butter cow is kryptonite.\n\nJust ask Rachelle McGivney of Des Moines, who was one of the 800 adult Iowans interrogated in the poll. She didn’t waver on her ho-hum feelings for the fair — which she doesn’t attend — when I called her back to hear her explanation.\n\n“I don’t really like all the crowds,” she said. “It’s all food. And it’s kind of expensive.”\n\nSo what does she prefer to the fair? Jazz festivals, she said.\n\nBefore this poll I would’ve assumed that jazz festivals were far less popular than the fair. But now I’m not so sure.\n\nMcGivney has a point that we might need to rename the event the Iowa State Food Fair. I participated this year in the inaugural New Food Reveal of gargantuan servings of meat and deep-fried oddities. It was a fun, Food Network-style tasting by a jury that left me bloated as it underscored just how seriously the fair is defending its diet-busting reputation.\n\n\"We're no dummies out here,\" said Gary Slater, the fair's CEO. \"We know what people like about the Iowa State Fair.\" Including fried food.\n\nWhile somewhat questioning the validity of the poll (as I firmly pushed back on that sentiment), Slater said that he was “encouraged” by the numbers but also considers them as motivation to, say, revamp the Midway carnival rides.\n\n\"That's why we change things around here from year to year,\" he said, \"because we try to do a better job and have attractions and programs that hit people’s hot button.\"\n\nThe other fair question we polled on this year showed even bleaker results: \"Have you ever entered the Iowa State fair, as a part of 4-H, or on your own with a hobby, artistic or cooking project or the like?\"\n\nOnly 7 percent of Iowans have ever entered a contest and won a ribbon at the fair.\n\nAnd a whopping 69 percent can't even imagine entering to try to win. The poll was conducted July 9-13 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines,\n\nAm I the only guy left in the state who has taken chickens to the State Fair? Or still can recite the 4-H pledge? (“I pledge my head to clearer thinking …”)\n\nI stood earlier this week inside the 4-H Building where about 3,800 ribbons alone will be awarded to 4-H kids with projects that range from framed photographs to a restored hay baler. The building superintendent, Mich Hoyer, a program coordinator in 4-H youth development for Iowa State University Extension and Outreach, like me, expected that a larger share of Iowans would admit to having State Fair ribbons tucked away somewhere in the back of the closet, considering tens of thousands of them are doled out annually. He thought that the percentage figure would have hit at least double digits.\n\n\"Every pig in the barn gets a ribbon,\" as he put it.\n\nI combed through the detailed demographics of the poll results to see whether there was an identifiable pattern driving the results. Was there some sort of partisan divide, or different trends among Clinton and Trump voters, or religious affiliation, or age groups to explain the results?\n\nThe only small ripple I could spot wasn’t at all surprising: Those on the lower end of the income scale were a little less likely to attend the fair.\n\nIn retrospect, I shouldn't have let my rural roots and native-Iowan pride get the better of me: In terms of basic math, the numbers make sense. Despite funny headlines from the Onion such as, \"Iowa State Fair guards told to shoot non-Iowa residents on sight,\" the fair draws a considerable number of out-of-state tourists (which Slater said that the fair hasn't measured in many years).\n\nThen there's the legendary Tarbell family of Centerville that through four generations of entering food contests has amassed more than 10,000 ribbons with its array of cookies and other artful edibles.\n\nThat was no surprise to Eddie Hatfield, the 92.5 FM Nash Icon radio guy whose current Facebook profile pic is the fair's Blue Ribbon mascot. He's the biggest fair cheerleader I know, so I made him guess the poll results just to gauge his reaction.\n\nHe guessed that 67 percent hadn't attended the fair in the last 10 years and that only 1 percent of Iowans had won a blue ribbon.\n\nPerhaps because of his reputation, he's surprised by how many people tell him in passing that they haven't set foot on the fairgrounds in years. And the ribbon winners he knows, like the Tarbells, are part of dynasties that have amassed piles of them.\n\n\"By the way,\" he wrote me, \"those that say, 'Haven't been in years,' I don't talk to them anymore. I don't need that kind of negativity in my life.\"\n\nSo there's my answer: I may have grossly overestimated how much my fellow Iowans care about the State Fair.\n\nBut all I need to do every August is pretend that the world is no bigger than whatever I can see from the top of the double Ferris wheel.\n\nAbout the poll\n\nThe Iowa Poll, conducted July 9-13 for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 800 Iowans ages 18 or older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age and sex to reflect the general population based on recent census data.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 800 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nKyle Munson can be reached at 515-284-8124 or kmunson@dmreg.com.

A nutritionist on the benefits of the fruit.", "text": "America's favorite fruit is consumed in abundance − to the tune of more than 40 million pounds. That's watermelon, of course, the fruit known for its striking colors, juicy crunch and water-laden slices.\n\nBut watermelon offers a lot more than just being a delicious summertime staple. Made up of more than 90% water, the fruit is also incredibly hydrating and is loaded with electrolytes to help one recharge after a morning workout or afternoon of play. It's chock full of nutrients and can even be a healthy companion snack for anyone looking to drop a few pounds.\n\nIs watermelon healthy?\n\nWatermelon has a host of health benefits including protecting one's joints from inflammation, improving digestive conditions, and being more rich in lycopene than any other fruit. Lycopene is an important antioxidant that has been linked to a decreased risk of cancer and heart disease. The fruit is also a great source of beta-carotene, which works to protect one's body from damaging molecules called free radicals. Watermelon is also \"high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and healthful phytochemicals,\" says Carol Johnston, PhD, RD, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University. Phytochemicals strengthen one's immune system and helps to prevent DNA damage.\n\nKaren Collins, MS, a registered dietitian and nutrition advisor to the American Institute for Cancer Research, says the fruit is an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and \"helps boost potassium and magnesium consumption - minerals that contribute to healthy blood pressure.\"\n\nDoes watermelon have a lot of sugar?\n\nWhile Johnston says watermelon \"satisfies the sweet tooth,\" it has less sugar than many other popular fruits. Mangoes, grapes, cherries and pears all have more grams of sugar per serving than watermelon. But watermelon still has about 17 grams per slice, so it's best not to load up on too much of it at once.\n\nAnd while it's often eaten by the slice, the fruit's \"natural sweetness\" also makes it a good option to mix with other fruits and vegetables and can \"keep salads both healthful and far from hum-drum,\" says Collins.\n\nWhat's the healthiest fruit? This one has cognitive and cardiovascular benefits.\n\nCan watermelon help you lose weight?\n\nAnother one of watermelon's health benefits is that it is low in calories while still being filling, making it a popular food some turn to when trying to drop a few pounds. Tara Schmidt, lead registered dietitian for the Mayo Clinic Diet, praises watermelon as one weight management tool because it is \"high in water, high in fiber, and low in calories. Water and fiber are two components in satiety - the feeling of being full,\" she explains.\n\nA cup of diced watermelon has less than 50 calories and offers about .6 grams of fiber and .9 grams of protein.\n\nWatermelon pieces in a pitcher of water are often used to create fruit water, which can help \"cut down on the temptation to choose sugar-sweetened drinks,\" explains Collins. \"And you can nibble on watermelon chunks from a bowl or platter and feel quite full without unintentionally overdoing it on calories,\" she adds.\n\nIs watermelon healthy to eat every day?\n\nBecause of its many health benefits, Collins says \"the standard serving size set by the USDA is twice as big for watermelon as for other fruit,\" and is OK to eat in moderation every day the fruit is in season.\n\nSchmidt echoes similar advice: \"It’s possible to eat too much of any food,\" she says, \"but often we like to consider consumption of fruits to be reasonably ‘unlimited’ as more than 80% of Americans are consuming a dietary pattern low in fruits and vegetables.\" Indeed, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that only 1 in 10 adults get enough fruits and vegetables.\n\nIn other words, erring on the side of consuming too much fruit is preferred over eating too little. Still, Collins advises pairing watermelon with other foods. \"Trying to fill up on nothing but bowls of watermelon is not leaving room for other foods that provide nutrients you need for overall health,\" she councils. \"But watermelon can be a great partner in shaping eating habits and helping maintain a healthy weight.\"\n\nRead more about healthy eating here:\n\nShould you be eating more grapes?They have a whole host of health benefits.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2017/07/04/cooling-foods-easy-summer-recipes/320925001/", "title": "11 cooling foods, 5 easy recipes to beat the heat", "text": "Robin Miller\n\nSpecial for The Republic\n\nWe love summer for its long, hassle-free days and plenty of fun in the sun. But when the mercury rises to unthinkable levels, summer can completely drain us all. The long days we craved in the winter seem never-ending.\n\nLet’s change that.\n\nBy making some smart food and beverage choices, we can minimize the sun’s toll on our bodies and enjoy every minute of every carefree day.\n\nFirst and foremost, don't get parched.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nDehydration is one of the major causes of low energy and increased heat exhaustion in the summer. And you often don’t feel dehydrated. By the time you feel thirst, you’ve been dehydrated for a while. Stay in front of it this summer and hydrate. Also, think beyond water (which is always a great choice). Fresh fruits and vegetables provide loads of water, with vitamins and minerals to boot. When you consume water, fruits and vegetables with a high water content, you hydrate the body’s cells, which translates to a lower body temperature.\n\nAnd there are powerful nutrients that cool you from within, too. Here are 11 foods that get the job done, with five recipes that incorporate most of them.\n\nCucumber\n\nWho wants to be “cool as a cucumber” this summer? When the temperature soars into the uncomfortable zone, we all do. So why is the veggie so cool? C ucumbers are profoundly hydrating; and it’s crucial to stay hydrated in the heat. Nibble on cucumber slices, dipped in cool ranch or hummus, for a great snack.\n\nGreen “juice” is another excellent option. Combine cucumber, lemon and spinach in a blender (with ice if desired) and puree until smooth and drinkable, adding a little water if necessary. If you want to try cucumbers in ways you’ve never tried before, whip up my Indian Raita with Naan and Watermelon Salsa recipes. You’ll be glad you did.\n\nWatermelon\n\nWith the amount of flavor it packs, it’s amazing to me that watermelon is 95 percent water. Sweet, juicy and crunchy, the fruit reduces body heat immediately — perhaps that’s why watermelon slices are such a welcome addition to every summer soiree. And it makes for a refreshing salsa.\n\nBut don’t relegate the melon to hand-held slices and “balls.” The flesh is excellent when pureed into a juice; I like to add a splash of lemon or lime.\n\nPeaches\n\nSummer or not, you should always reach for seasonal produce first. Why? Seasonal fruits and vegetables dish up what the season craves. In the summer, peaches fit the coolant bill (whereas tubers and winter squashes warm us like space heaters in the winter).\n\nAt just 35-50 calories each, fresh peaches are crammed with vitamins A and C, riboflavin and potassium, essential nutrients for maintaining healthy skin and body. And take note: Dried peaches help regulate the body’s production of heat. For a sensational peach dessert, try my Strawberry Peach Sherbet recipe .\n\nLeafy greens\n\nWhen it comes to healthy food options, leafy green vegetables seem to find a spot on every list. Greens like spinach, kale, collard greens and romaine are all rich in vitamins and minerals, besides having a very high water content. Ve ggies that are brimming with water not only cool the body, they’re easier to digest. That means your body doesn’t have to work as hard, which saves you energy and keeps you cool.\n\nOpt for large green salads mixed with other water-rich vegetables, such as celery, iceberg lettuce and tomato. Need a recipe to kick-start things? Look out for my Wilted Kale Salad with Coconut Water Vinaigrette .\n\nPineapple\n\nJust like leafy greens and cucumbers, fresh pineapple is crammed with water and nutrients. Consider adding the flavorful, cooling fruit to salads and smoothies. You also can place fresh pineapple slices on burgers and grilled chicken for extra flavor and texture. You’ll get heat from the meat and cool from the fruit.\n\nAn added bonus? Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that reduces inflammation in the body. Check out my recipe for Hawaiian Chicken with Grilled Pineapple and Zucchini , which incorporates two cooling foods.\n\nZucchini\n\nThe true squash of summer, zucchini ranges in color from yellow to dark green. All varieties are water-packed and high in vitamin C, phytonutrients and manganese, a mineral that helps protect your body from free-radical damage (especially important when we spend long summer days in the blazing sun). Manganese also promotes collagen production and the growth of healthy bone tissue.\n\nFresh mint\n\nChock-full of antioxidants, mint has been used as a home remedy for lowering body heat for centuries. There’s no doubt the zesty herb provides a cooling effect, but why? A quick science primer will explain: Our nervous system is built to sense changes in temperature. The receptor protein that senses those temp changes is TRPM8 and it’s found in all cold-sensing nerve cells. Once activated by TRPM8, our nerve cells send a message to the brain that “things are cooling down.”\n\nHere’s where mint comes in: It contains menthol, a chemical that directly binds to TRPM8 and activates it. In essence, it tricks the brain into sensing a temperature change. Trickery or not, it’s a cool effect. I add fresh mint to my Strawberry Peach Sherbet recipe, and whiz mint leaves into juices and smoothies all summer long.\n\nRadishes\n\nApart from being water-rich, radishes are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that lowers body heat. Radishes also have anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for fighting heat stress. Add sliced radishes to your salads and sandwiches and let the cooling begin.\n\nLemons\n\nAll citrus fruits have incredible cooling effects on the body, and they promote detoxification (thanks to vitamin C). Add a squeeze of fresh lemon (and lemon wedges) to your water and, as you sip and stay hydrated throughout the day, you’ll be adding immune-boosting compounds that protect your body and skin (the body’s largest organ).\n\nYogurt\n\nCurd is a dairy product obtained by curdling milk with an acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vinegar. In India, curd is hailed for its ability to aid digestion and provide a cooling relief from spicy foods. It’s a well-known body coolant. Y ogurt is obtained using a similar process (the milk is fermented with two different strains of live bacteria), and it produces the same cooling result.\n\nCreate cool summer treats by using yogurt (regular or Greek) as the base for smoothies, milkshakes, dips and “ice cream bars.” For a refreshing dessert, add diced fruit and mixed berries to yogurt and top with a sprinkling of granola or nuts. For a great side dish, try my Indian Raita with Naan .\n\nCoconut water\n\nCoconut water is loaded with electrolytes and essential minerals that help keep the body well hydrated. Drink a glass of coconut water to naturally balance the electrolyte levels in your body and to regulate your body temperature. Also, try my Coconut Water Vinaigrette .\n\nTHE RECIPES\n\nWatermelon Salsa\n\nServings: 8-10.\n\nFrom Robin Miller\n\n3 cups diced watermelon\n\n1 cup diced cucumber, preferably seedless/English cucumber (also called hothouse)\n\n½ cup diced mango (also water-rich!)\n\n¼ cup minced white onion\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\n\n1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced\n\n2-3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil\n\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\nPreparation:\n\nCombine all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss to combine.

But like any human food, be careful feeding your feline the fruit.\n\nWatermelon is non-toxic to cats and can be given as a treat from time to time, according to Purina. If you give your cat watermelon, it should be seedless. Watermelon seeds contain trace amounts of cyanide which is toxic to cats.\n\nIs watermelon good for cats?\n\nWatermelon isn't particularly good for cats, although it is safe for them to eat.\n\nThere are not many health benefits when cats do eat watermelon. They may get some hydration, potassium or vitamin C from the fruit, but \"the benefit is likely to be minimal,\" according to PetMD. A cat is more likely to get the necessary nutrients in their regular diet.\n\nSince watermelon is not part of a cat's typical diet, it is important to not overfeed them. Giving your pet too much watermelon could cause an upset stomach or diarrhea.\n\nIf your cat is overweight or has diabetes, you shouldn't feed them watermelon. The sugar in the fruit is not good for certain cats and could lead to further health issues.\n\nHow to feed cats watermelon\n\nIf you want to feed your cat watermelon, make sure to remove the seeds and rind. Both are choking hazards to cats. Watermelon rinds can also cause intestinal blockages or an upset stomach.\n\nCut the watermelon into bite-sized pieces and feed it to your cat.\n\nYou may find your cat does not like watermelon.

But face it, kids, the way 2020 is going … well, who had “Christmas Gets Postponed Until 2022’’ in Dystopian Bingo?\n\nSpeaking strictly secularly, of course, what better time than now — when we can at least socially distant gather outside around the most sincere firepit or best-decorated inflatable palm tree — to get the holiday party started?\n\nHere, then, are 25 ways to celebrate Christmas in July … just maybe skip the Ugly Sweater contest.\n\n1. Go Christmas caroling: Warm up your singing voice and rehearse with the people you share germs ... then serenade your neighbors with the earliest-ever rendition of “Let it Snow.’’ Just make sure you stay on the sidewalk. (Extra credit if then can hear you over their air conditioning and their own “Hamilton’’ sing-along.)\n\n2. Create your own festive hot chocolate bar by laying out whipped cream, crushed candy canes (you know you stashed some leftovers in that mug your kid made at camp), red and green sprinkles and peppermint or gingerbread flavored syrups. Crank up the air conditioner for this activity, so you can enjoy your hot beverage while chillin’ to “Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown.’’\n\n3. Who are we kidding? This weird holiday calls for icy adult drinks. Find a recipe below. Or watch our video above for Watermelon Mint Mojito.\n\n4. Give the gift of friendship. Without knowing I was going to write this story, my best friend from high school showed up at my house Sunday with a giant box of gifts she had stowed away in recent years and never got around to wrapping. We agreed that, thanks to COVID-19, we may not see each other much once the weather turns cold. It reminded me how grateful I am for her every day of the year, even a bad year. Especially a bad year.\n\n5. Candy, candy canes, candy corn and syrup. Make sure you have all of those on hand, as well as a big pot of cooked spaghetti when you host backyard movie night and screen “Elf.’’ After all, Bob Newhart and Ed Asner make anything better.\n\n6. Speaking of elves, dust off your Elf on a Shelf, make that dude a mask and … well, he’s used to social distancing. Get creative hiding that little guy around the pool, garden and front porch. Just make sure he stays at least 6 feet away from Barbie at all times!\n\n7. All jokes aside, if you can afford it, it’s not a bad time to stimulate the Main Street economy. Why not also cheer up a few isolated folks — or someone who perhaps suffered a coronavirus-related loss — with some Secret Santa surprises? Dig out that leftover wrapping paper and arrange some curbside pickups and front porch deliveries.\n\n8. Make a wreath for your front door using sunglasses, drink umbrellas, flower leis, flip flops and beach tags.\n\n9. Decorate a potted fern with shells gathered from your most recent beach adventure and pretend you’re ringing in the New Year in the islands.\n\n10. We can’t make it snow, not when the thermometer reads 90 degrees. But if you own a Slip and Slide, you can pretend to be sledding. Crank up “Mele Kalikimaka’’ while you’re at it, if only to annoy the neighbors.\n\n11. We take that back. Don’t be naughty to your neighbors. If we go back into serious lockdown, you may be spending actual Christmas passing turkey and mashed potatoes to them over the fence. Good neighbors are more important than ever these days, so maybe buy them some extra toilet paper and stick a bow on it?\n\n12. The world is divided in two groups. Those who wouldn’t be caught dead bingeing Hallmark Christmas specials and those who wait all year for the privilege of doing so. Only you don’t have to wait. Hallmark started celebrating “Countdown to Christmas’’ earlier this month. They are featuring movies such as “Christmas at the Plaza’’ and “Christmas in Rome’’ through July 26 on the cable channel, and streaming some favorites like “North Pole’’ and “Christmas Train’’ on the app. Visit hallmarkchannel.com/christmas\n\n13. Nothing kills the holiday buzz more than that January credit card bill. Start your holiday shopping now from the comfort of your back deck, avoid the rush and avoid those nasty mailbox surprises.\n\n14. Not quite ready for baking gingerbread men in your shorts and flip flops? How about Melted Snowman Cookies (sorry, Frosty!) instead? Check out this recipe from Betty Crocker and then surprise your neighborhood with some porch drops.\n\n15. Got a watermelon? It’s almost National Watermelon Day, so rather than cube it or slice it, cut out some Christmas tree shapes and nestle them on a bed of fresh mint to your next socially distant barbecue.\n\n16. What the world needs now are more Muppets: Asbury Park Press entertainment writer Alex Biese says, “We need Emmet Otter this year, regardless of the season. Jim Henson’s charming and poignant film ‘Emmet Otter’s Jug-Band Christmas’ originally aired as a television special in 1977 and is currently streaming via Amazon Prime. The film is a timeless and tender story of working-class folks just trying to get by with the power of love, community and some great songs by Paul Williams.’’\n\n17. Did your family get their Porch-raits taken during the lockdown? Time to design those holiday cards! You can get some creative inspiration from either SnapFish or Shutterfly.\n\n18. Eat more chocolate. Like your really need a reason? When the sugar rush hits, FaceTime your adult siblings and argue again about why that doll is on the Island of Misfit Toys!\n\n19. Get out of the heat by donning your mask and visiting a Christmas shop. Retire some of your ugliest ornaments. If you find treasures, you can always dangle them from the nearest tomato vine.\n\n20. Stuff some beach \"stockings\" with sunscreen, beach snacks, water toys and good beach reads for Mom and Dad.\n\n21. Thinking of smoking some brisket or pork shoulder? How about smoking a turkey instead? Serve with some peach compote and a summer shandy.\n\n22. String some Christmas lights outside, host a backyard firepit and roast some chestnuts along with those s’mores. Did Jimmy Buffet ever make a Christmas album?\n\n23. Treat your kids to some \"hot cocoa\" sundaes with chocolate ice cream, mini marshmallows and chocolate shavings.\n\n24. Have the kids research holiday traditions from their heritage, then let them choose their favorites and plan ahead.\n\n25. Christmas is the season of giving but the world is struggling. If you are doing OK, Santa wanted me to remind you that you don’t have to wait until winter to donate canned goods, volunteer at a food bank or soup kitchen (assuming that you are not at elevated risk for the virus) or make a donation to your favorite charity.\n\nMerry Christmas!

But it's important to remember that high heat indices raise your chances of heat-related illnesses including heatstroke, exhaustion, and dehydration.\n\nExcessive heat watch in effect for later this week\n\nThe human body burns through hydration much quicker in hot weather, so drinking the right beverages to stay healthy and cool is vital. While many sports drinks, juices, and other products claim to be beneficial for retaining hydration and electrolytes, how can you know which products will really help you and your family on blistering summer days?\n\nHere's a list of some of the best — and worst — beverages to keep on hand during a heat wave.\n\nThe best:\n\nWater:\n\nIt goes without saying that water is the best and most effective way to stay hydrated during the summer. Devoid of excess sugars, salts, and unnecessary additives, pure water is what the human body craves.\n\nWater makes up over half the human body weight, so replenishing our supply is an important component in our daily consumption habits. It's often heard that humans need to be drinking eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day, but the Mayo Clinic recommends roughly three liters of fluid per day for men and just over two liters a day for women.\n\nWhile that may sound like a lot of liquid, pacing yourself with just one glass at a time can help. Cool, clean fresh water is the best choice for hydration; if plain water bores you, the addition of lemon slices, cucumber slices, or ice cubes may help. Green tea is also a tasty, refreshing twist on plain water that adds flavor without sugar or salt.\n\nCoconut water\n\nThe coconut water craze is backed by some healthy hype: low in carbohydrates but high in protein, coconut water is effective in re-hydrating your body in high heat or after light exercise. Unsweetened coconut water is the best choice in high heats.\n\nIf you're not doing heavy exercise in the heat wave, coconut water is a great choice. After all, the Red Cross urges people experiencing a heat wave to stay in air conditioned areas and refrain from heavy outdoor exercise. However, if you simply can't wait until the heat breaks to get outside and work out, you may want to reach for a beverage a little higher in sodium, to replace what your body will lose during rigorous exercise.\n\nFat free or skim milk\n\nWhile it may seem counter-intuitive, a recent study has suggested that fat free milk can be better than water or a sports drink at re-hydrating kids.\n\nHigh in protein, carbs, calcium and electrolytes, milk is naturally rich in the nutrients sports drink manufacturers artificially add to their beverages. Milk also helps replenish the sodium that is lost when the body is active or sweating.\n\nWhen the weather is nice, it's hard to keep the kids indoors, but a cold glass of fat free or skim milk will help to insure their active bodies stay hydrated and healthy.\n\nGreen or fruit smoothies\n\nA portion of our daily water intake comes from the foods we eat, and there's no type of food more hydrating than fruits and vegetables. By making smoothies with nutrient-rich green vegetables like kale and spinach, or water-based fruits and veggies like cantaloupe, watermelon, and cucumber, you can get in a serving of the good stuff while simultaneously hydrating your body.\n\nIn order to reap the most hydrating benefits from your smoothies, it's best to make them from scratch at home. Pre-made smoothies can be loaded up with unnecessary processed sugars, sodium, and other additives that aren't helpful when you're trying to hydrate.\n\nOptions like a honeydew and coconut milk smoothie or a strawberry and watermelon smoothie taste like a sweet treat but do wonders for your body. Choose plant-based protein powders and natural sweeteners like honey or agave nectar to sweeten the deal without overloading your body on sugar, making yourself more thirsty in the process.\n\nThe worst:\n\nSports drinks\n\nSports drinks are frequently advertised as powerful electrolyte-replenishing elixirs, the only thing you'll need to quench your thirst (or ease a hangover). And while sports drinks, with their high levels of sugar and sodium, can be excellent for athletes and those who work out vigorously for long periods of time in hot conditions, those same benefits turn to detriments for the casual drinker.\n\nIt's unlikely that during an extreme heat wave you'll feel up to any kind of intense exercise, rendering the additional sugar and sodium in sports drinks useless. While sports drinks aren't necessarily the worst of the worst, they're not the most effective hydrators for a heat wave.\n\nSoft drinks\n\nSugary-sweet soft drinks make the \"worst\" list for high heat hydrators, due to their incredibly high sugar content and the inclusion of caffeine.\n\nCaffeine is a diuretic, or a substance which increases the passing of urine, and therefore does not aid in hydration. While the levels of caffeine in a can of soda are typically less than that of a cup of coffee (which has been debunked as a dehydrator in moderation), it's collaboration with the sugar in soft drinks can be straining on the body.\n\nThe recommended daily allowance of sugars is 39.5 grams for men and 25 grams for women, but one 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola has 39 grams of sugar; one can of Coke can put you at or well over your recommended daily intake of sugars.\n\nThe body uses water to metabolize refined sugar, leading to an endless cycle of drinking and becoming thirsty when you choose a soft drink on a hot day.\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\nWhile reaching for an ice cold beer or a margarita on a hot day might sound like paradise, alcohol is among the worst choices for hydrating beverages during a heat wave.\n\nLike caffeinated beverages, alcohol is a diuretic, so potentially hydrating liquids will pass through you much more quickly while under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol also negatively influences the mechanism that regulates water levels in the human body, reducing the amount of anti-diuretic hormone your body produces and increasing urination, ultimately dehydrating you. And over indulging in alcohol can lead to vomiting, especially in very hot conditions, which can result in or worsen dehydration.\n\nPlus, your favorite summertime cocktails are loaded with excess sugars and sodium, which, like in sports drinks, might be necessary for hard-working athletes but an utter detriment to less active folks during a heat wave.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nAs excessive heat approaches the St. Cloud area this Wednesday, reach for hydrating beverages like water, coconut water, or homemade fruit smoothies to keep cool and healthy. While sports drinks might be helpful to professional athletes, high heat indices and low activity mean that basic water is a much healthier choice. Stay indoors, use air conditioning, and wear light, loose fitting clothing to prevent heatstroke, exhaustion, and other heat-related illnesses. Remember to drink hydrating liquids regularly but with a steady, moderate pace.\n\nFollow Alyssa Zaczek on Twitter @sctimesalyssa, email her at azaczek@stcloudtimes.com, or call her at 255-8761.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/07/09/4-ways-stop-sweating-through-your-clothes/1560355001/", "title": "4 ways to stop sweating through your clothes this summer", "text": "What's the biggest pitfall of a warm summer day? Dealing with sweaty pits.\n\nSweat can be uncomfortable and smelly. Stains can be embarrassing. But you don't have to go through summer soaking through all your shirts. We spoke to two doctors and a fashion designer to shed light on why we sweat and how we can control it — beyond just using deodorant.\n\nHere are some tips to help keep you dry and smelling fresh this summer.\n\n1. Change your diet\n\nWhat we eat has an effect on how much we sweat. If you want to curb your sweaty pits, try staying away from caffeine and spicy foods.\n\n\"Caffeine triggers sweat as it excites the central nervous system, which then activates sweat glands,\" said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Similarly, avoid spicy foods like hot sauces, peppers and spices, which can increase the amount of sweat you produce.\"\n\nIf you want to calm your body to reduce sweat, try eating hydrating foods such as watermelon and apples.\n\n\"A more natural route is to eat foods that calm the body, like cucumber. Cucumbers are also filled with water and hydration is key to keep from perspiring. The more hydrated you are, the less hot you’ll be,\" said Dr. Howard Murad, dermatologist and founder of Murad Skincare.\n\n2. Wear breathable fabrics\n\nBreathable clothing like cotton and linen allow for ventilation, which can help keep sweaty pits and thighs at bay, fashion designer Christian Siriano said in an email.\n\nSiriano recommends going with colorful and contrasting outfits because both will distract from sweat stains.\n\n\"Blouses and dresses with bold patterns will hide stains much better than solids,\" the \"Project Runway\" star said. \"Stepping outside of your comfort zones and embracing new cuts, colors and fabrics will also help hide stains.\"\n\nRaleigh Dale, a 26-year-old who lives with hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating, suggests wearing sheer shirts or dual layer clothing like a blazer and a tank top. If you end up sweating through your tank top, you can put your blazer on to cover up.\n\n3. Wet wipes are your friend\n\nSweat is sometimes accompanied by odor because it interacts with the bacteria on your skin.\n\n\"Bad smells are exacerbated when sweat is allowed to sit in a cool damp place for an extended period of time as smells are produced when moisture reacts to bacteria on the skin,\" said Zeichner.\n\nIf you're perspiring and don't want to smell, make sure to grab a wet wipe or damp paper towel and do a quick sweep under your pits and then dry them off.\n\n4. Manage your stress\n\nBeing stressed can trigger sweat.\n\nMurad suggests doing simple breathing exercises to help lower stress. He also suggests taking chlorophyll tablets, which can offset some of the body odor some people can experience from sweating. Eating green vegetables such as broccoli and brussels sprouts can help, too.\n\nIt's OK to be sweaty\n\nSweat is the natural method your body uses to cool itself off. Zeichner said it's healthy for your body to sweat and it's a necessary part of survival.\n\nGo sweaty you!\n\nIf you're sweating excessively (four to five times more than normal) you may have hyperhidrosis, a disorder that makes you sweat regardless of whether it's hot out or you're physically exerting yourself.\n\n\"It’s believed that excessive sweating happens when sweat glands overreact to stimuli. If you think you might sweat more than the average amount, I encourage you to see a dermatologist for a sweat assessment and to learn about ways to manage sweat,\" Zeichner said.\n\nDale said she boosted her confidence by understanding that her sweat does not define her.\n\n\"No one’s going to remember your sweaty armpits eight hours later,\" she says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/2023/07/06/how-to-hydrate-fast/70336192007/", "title": "What is the fastest way to cure dehydration?

While that may seem like a lot, water is needed for all of your body's cells, tissues and organs.\n\nWater makes up 50% to 70% of your body weight. In other words, you need to drink a lot of water to stay healthy. Continue reading to learn about dehydration and the fastest way to cure it.\n\nWhat is the fastest way to cure dehydration?\n\nDehydration occurs when you use or lose more fluids than you take in, meaning your body does not have enough water to complete its normal functions, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nMild to moderate dehydration can be cured by simply rehydrating your body with fluids. Eating foods with a high water content will also help with rehydration, such as fruits and vegetables. Strawberries and watermelon are 91% water, while lettuce can contain 96% water and celery 95%, according to My Food Data.\n\nWhat drinks hydrate the fastest?\n\nWater will rehydrate your body perfectly fine, but drinks with infused electrolytes can also help.

It’s the kind of heat that makes you want to stay inside with the air conditioner on until deer season. But if you do that, you’ll miss out on some of the best inshore action the coast has to offer.\n\n“Some of the best redfishing we have is in July, August and September,” said Sonny Schindler of Shore Thing Charters. “It’s not uncommon to have multiple hook-ups.”\n\nRedfish are in the marshes and other inshore areas all year, but when the water temperature climbs, the bull reds seem to come out of the woodwork.\n\n“Usually, the big ones, we almost always encounter them chasing schools of baitfish,” Schindler said. “The big ones, they’re almost always hanging around those big snapping schools of pogies.\n\n“Those schools of pogies and freakin’ redfish go together like peas and carrots.”\n\nUnfortunately, redfish aren’t the only fish in the sea that have a taste for pogies.\n\n“You may have to deal with some sharks or mutant catfish,” Schindler said.\n\nBut picking a fight with a shark isn’t such a bad thing.\n\nWhen the shark bites\n\n“The warmer the weather, the better the shark fishing — always,” Schindler said. “We seldom fish for them after October, and they don’t show back up until May.”\n\nWhether it’s because of Shark Week or “Sharknado,” no one knows, but catching sharks has become more popular with Schindler’s clients.\n\n“I guess people didn’t know it was an option,” Schindler said. “They think of fishing the marsh in 2 feet of water, which we do, but we cross deep channels and fish the barrier islands, which are full of sharks. They are thick as thieves.”\n\nSchindler targets them by fishing in schools of baitfish or creating a chum slick with cut baitfish. He Carolina rigs an 8/0 or 10/0 circle hook on a No. 9 wire leader and uses up to a 2-ounce weight, depending on the current. For bait, he uses a whole mullet.\n\n“Most of what you’re going to see is 21/2- to 3-footers, but we’ve gotten them over 150 pounds,” Schindler said. “The biggest one we’ve gotten was just under 200 pounds.”\n\nAnd folks who decide to keep one for dinner are in for a treat.\n\n“No bones, big hunks of white meat,” Schindler said. “I keep saying it, but we’re spoiled down here. It’s fantastic eating.”\n\nTriple the fun\n\nTripletail, or blackfish, have become a prime target for anglers looking for a big fight and a delicacy on the grill. And now is the time to go after them.\n\n“By mid-June they are usually here in big numbers,” Ronnie Daniels of Fisher-Man Guide Service said. “By July and August it’s in full swing.”\n\nTripletail are ambush hunters and basically lazy. They relate to floating objects and wait for a meal to pass by.\n\n“They get up and lay on their side and look like a big shadow,” Daniels said. “We’ve caught them under a latex glove, under a watermelon rind – anything that’s floating. Anything that’s floating and provides shade.”\n\nOnce he’s spotted a tripletail, Daniels prefers fishing a live shrimp on a treble hook under a cigar-shaped cork that doesn’t make the disturbance of a traditional popping cork.\n\n“Once you see him turn on that shrimp, he’s eating it,” Daniels said. “I’d say 70 percent of the fish don’t pull the cork under until you set the hook on him.\n\n“Give him a second or two to get the shrimp in his mouth and set the hook.”\n\nWaiting too long to set the hook is a bad idea, but waiting too long to go fishing for tripletail is worse.\n\n“Generally, by October, they’re starting to think about heading south — or wherever they go,” Daniels said.\n\nContact Brian Broom at (601) 961-7225 or bbroom@gannett.com.

Usually my family and I would camp near a river, most often at Breitenbush Campground in Willamette National Forest, just east of Detroit Lake.\n\nAs we got older, camping seemed to change a little. My dad and step mom got a camper in which they slept, and as life got busier we didn't always get to gather together during the summer months and spend time outdoors.\n\nNow as an adult, I try to make camping a priority as soon as the weather is nice enough — and even when it's not — because those few nights outdoors during the summer are some of the best sleep I get all year.\n\nMost recently I headed north along the Oregon Coast to meet up with some friends that were coming from Seattle. Fort Stevens State Park is about halfway between Seattle and Salem, and is known for it's rich history and abundance of outdoor activities.\n\nFort Stevens is the northwesternmost part of Oregon, located near Seaside as well as Astoria. The top left corner of the state is not one I've spent a lot of time exploring, but there's a large difference in the lay of the land compared to the central Oregon coast range. The look of the fog as it starts to burn off the beach contrasted with the coastal mountain range reminds me of Hawaii, or the show \"Lost.\"\n\nA fascinating fact about Fort Stevens, is that it was once the primary military defense system (of three in the area) at the mouth of the Columbia. The fort was in service for 84 years beginning during the Civil War and closing at the end of World War II.\n\nMaybe the most interesting historical part of the area is the Peter Iredale shipwreck.\n\nOne of the very first things you see as your toes hit the sand of the beach access area is a large, rusty, piece of ship. What was once a steel sailing vessel en route to the Columbia River is now a shipwreck on the beach upon which children climb and play.\n\nIn an attempt to enter the mouth of the Columbia at 3:20 a.m., the vessel ran ashore on Oct. 25, 1906 because of fog, mist, and rough seas and was abandoned on the beach. The crew of 27 people was rescued via lifeboat dispatched from the Hammond area, and the group suffered no casualties.\n\nThe Fort Stevens area is popular on weekends — so making reservations for lodging is essential. The tricky thing about reserving camping spots at any state park in Oregon is that you have to do it at least two days in advance. Making a reservation for that coming evening, or the following one isn't possible via phone or online.\n\nRELATED: On the trail of 'The Goonies': Popular coastal destinations featured in movie\n\nSince we had already made plans with our out of town friends, we had to just head to the coast and hope for the best. Luckily, once we got to the campsite check-in area at Fort Stevens State Park the woman in line in front of us had just cancelled her reservation for the evening and we got her spot. That's got to be good karma, right?\n\nOnce we secured a spot, which was $21 for the evening, the five of us set up two different tents and organized our belongings. Once the afternoon started to fade into evening, we packed the cooler and grabbed everything we needed to have a bonfire on the beach.\n\nTurns out that roasted hot dogs, cold beer, s'mores and good conversation were all that was needed to complete a perfect beach night.\n\nAfter watching the sunset and sitting near the fire for a while longer, the wind started to pick up and we headed back to the campsite. The beach is only about a mile from the campgrounds, an easy walk or bike ride if you're not carrying very many things — but there are also a couple of parking areas if driving makes more sense.\n\nFor those of you who are looking for a family oriented campground, Fort Stevens is the place to be. While there were plenty of children, families, dogs and RVs there was not a lot of time that was quiet. Some people love a really busy campground with a lot of company; others like to enjoy the absence of humans and cars.\n\nWhether you're looking for a day trip to the northern coast, a place to camp for a night, or a dose of history — head to Fort Stevens State Park to find it all.\n\nAlisha Roemeling is an outdoors and community reporter for the Statesman Journal.

The folks at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently put together some interesting facts about the twosome, and we thought it would be a good idea to share them with readers who plan to hit the beach this summer. Here's what NOAA had to say on the topic:\n\nWhat do seals and sharks have in common?\n\nBoth seals and sharks have inhabited waters around Cape Cod and the Islands for centuries, long before humans.\n\nBoth have been increasing in numbers since the passage of federal regulations after populations were severely depleted by hunting and fishing.\n\nSeals and sharks each play a role in maintaining a healthy oceanic ecosystem.\n\nPopulation numbers for both seals and sharks in Cape waters are unknown due to their seasonal migrations and foraging behaviors.\n\nBoth have diverse diets and eat what is readily available. Seals and sharks each consume different prey based upon their age, size and location.\n\n2020:New study to gauge attitudes toward sharks, seals\n\nAre there a lot of sharks off Cape Cod?\n\nShark populations have been slowly increasing since the 1990s due to the implementation of management measures.\n\nThe U.S. has managed its shark fisheries since 1993, and banned both the commercial and recreational harvesting of white sharks in 1997. There is currently no estimate of white sharks in Cape waters; research is ongoing.\n\nSharing research:Great white shark research consortium established\n\nA 2014 study used records compiled over more than 200 years, revealing that white sharks occur primarily between Massachusetts and New Jersey during the summer, off Florida during winter, and have a broad distribution along the U.S. East Coast during spring and fall.\n\nWhite sharks appear to be more common in coastal rather than offshore waters in the U.S. Atlantic, although preliminary satellite tracking data suggest individuals may also spend considerable time beyond the continental shelf.\n\nWhat do sharks eat?\n\nMost sharks are opportunistic feeders, but some species have a more selective diet. The basking shark, often mistaken for a white shark in New England waters, is one of the largest species and is a filter feeder.\n\nThe smooth dogfish, a summer visitor to New England waters, is a small coastal shark that specializes in crustaceans.\n\nMany species, like the white shark, change their diet as they get larger, eating smaller prey items when they are young and moving on to larger prey as they grow.\n\nVideo:Shark attacks seal off Nantucket\n\nThe white shark eats primarily fish when it is young and prefers marine mammals at larger sizes. Scavenging is also an important source of food for many sharks. White sharks are fairly solitary animals, but have been known to feed together in groups when they are scavenging a large food source, such as a dead whale.\n\nWhat is the most common shark attack?\n\nFour million people visit the Cape Cod National Seashore each year. As the human population increases, more people are visiting beaches. The 2018 fatal shark attack on the Cape was the first in Massachusetts in more than 80 years (last was 1936 in Mattapoisett).\n\nA shark attack occurs once every 730 million beach visits, or about one in a billion chance (Stanford University study).\n\nWorldwide, sharks kill on average six humans each year; in the U.S. an average of one person per year. Humans kill an estimated 100 million sharks each year.\n\nStates with the highest number of shark attacks since 2000 (in order from highest) are Florida, Hawaii, South Carolina, California, North Carolina, Texas, Oregon, Georgia and Alabama. In 2018 there were 32 unprovoked shark attacks in the U.S., with one fatality. (Source: International Shark Attack File)\n\nCutting edge research:New technology expected to play key role in Cape Cod shark research\n\nHow common are shark attacks on Cape Cod?\n\nOver a period of 5 years, at just 6 beaches at the Cape Cod National Seashore, lifeguards rescued 680 people from the water due to riptides. On the Outer Cape, the risk of drowning from riptides is much greater than the risk of being attacked by a shark. Odds of being injured by sharks are far less than from fireworks, lightning strikes, car and bicycle accidents, and jellyfish stings.\n\nBees, wasps, snakes, dogs, and taking selfies cause far more fatalities each year than sharks. On the list of dangers in aquatic environments, sharks rank near the bottom. Odds of drowning and other beach-related fatalities are 1 in 2 million, shark attacks are 1 in 11.5 million.\n\nWhat types of seals are off the Cape?\n\nThere are two similar species of seals that inhabit the Cape and Islands—gray and harbor seals.\n\nAdult gray seals can weigh between 550 and 850 pounds and are on the Cape year-round. Adult harbor seals weighing between 100 and 300 pounds are seasonal residents on the Cape between September and May.\n\nGray seals: There are an estimated 425,000 gray seals (2016 study) that move up and down the Atlantic coast between the U.S. and Canada, where their abundance is increasing at a rate of 4–5 percent per year. During the breeding season, December through February, there are an estimated 27,000 in U.S. waters. Gray seals eat primarily sand lance, hakes and flatfish, and squids. Diet data comes mainly from juvenile animals; more research is needed on animals at other life stages.\n\nHarbor seals: There are an estimated 75,000 harbor seals from eastern Canada to North Carolina. Their breeding season is May through June, primarily in Maine. After the breeding season ends they disperse throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region. In the Northeast region, they eat mainly a variety of groundfish (hakes, cod, haddock, flatfish), redfish, herring and squids; diet data comes mainly from juvenile animals and more research is needed on animals at other life stages.\n\nWhy are there so many seals on Cape Cod?\n\nSeals move around to forage and spend significant amounts of time in the water, making it hard to estimate their numbers. Seasonal changes in gray and harbor seal abundance outside of the breeding season are unknown. Population numbers have been increasing since federal regulations protecting marine mammals were put in place in the 1970s. A 2016 study estimated 30–50,000 animals at various times in southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nDig deeper:Researchers get the scoop on seals\n\nOPINION:Seal cull is not a long-term solution to shark attacks\n\nCulling has been tried in the past (U.S. and elsewhere) and was shown to be ineffective. Gray seals from Canada continuously supplement seals in the United States, so seals that are removed will just be replaced by animals from other regions.\n\nSource: NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2016/08/21/orioles-outlook-pitching-wieters/89054590/", "title": "State of the O's, Wieters, Big Papi and Boog's BBQ", "text": "Brian Reese\n\nbreese2@dmg.gannett.com\n\nPlease don't label me a bad fan, or even worse — a Yankees fan — but I went to my first Orioles game of the season this past Tuesday night in Baltimore against the Red Sox.\n\nI'd like to think if it wasn't for work, beach days and our completely dominant (sort of) company softball team taking up every weekend this summer, I could've celebrated so many Miller times with Gary Thorne by now.\n\nEveryone knows it's been a season of tremendous highs and pretty embarrassing lows for the Orioles. With the highs mostly being associated with the bats and the lows because of the pitching, though there have been stretches like the recent Oakland away series where those roles have been flipped.\n\nBut we all totally knew this before the beginning of the season, right?\n\nIt's what I've been saying all season long. The O's are going to have big peaks and valleys. The home runs would come in troves, Jonesy would chase pitches as far away as Dundalk and Hyun Soo Kim would capture our hearts in ways we never could've thought possible. The pitchers would have to pitch above their ability (Tillman was good before, but he's been great) and young guys such as Kevin Gausman (run support or nah?) and Dylan Bundy \"Funday\" were going to have to improve to move the needle into ALCS/World Series contention.\n\nBut probably most importantly, Buck would have to periodically get a haircut and/or take off that sweltering sauna of a jacket to appease my mother.\n\nMORE THOUGHTS FROM BRIAN REESE: Why Talladega Nights is the cinematic masterpiece of our time\n\nWhat I saw on Tuesday night was pretty much exactly that, despite a surprising lack of dongs from the Orioles.\n\nAnd I was totally cool with that.\n\nYes, Yovanni isn't going to be Clayton Kershaw or Chris Sale, but he has a 2.87 ERA and has averaged 5 2/3 innings since the All-Star break. Gausman has a 2.57 ERA since the break and that's including that awful six-run loss to the Blue Jays on July 27. Bundy has a 2.00 ERA over his last six games! If we take out his most recent game where he allowed five runs (on two untimely homers) at Boston and his July 17 sort-of start when he was thrown in the deep end at Tampa, he'd be looking even better.\n\nAnd Tillman has a 2.50 ERA since the break, even with including that six-run stomping by Colorado on July 26.\n\nTilly, Yovanni, Goose and Bunday Funday are all climbing up the pitching ranks faster than hippies summiting a national park trail in an Olive Green Subaru Outback.\n\nThe Orioles just need to continue trending upward without completely bombing out.\n\nEverybody can chill. Drink the Natty Boh even though it's not technically \"local.\" Eat the Boog's after you tell the man behind the name that Diet Coke is a sin, and sit next to the Boston fans because unlike Toronto fans, they won't pour a beer on you. I don't think those folks waste a drop of Samuel Adams, even if it's 9:30 a.m.\n\nSpeaking of Boston, Papi's still really cool. Especially when he's Kenan Thompson-Papi and not hitting the ball hard/tearing up your visitor dugout phone. Baltimore needs to do what Katie Nolan and Garbage Time did and get Papi a commemorative phone booth to smash at his heart's desire.\n\nAlso Mookie Betts is a ridiculously good baseball player and Dustin Pedroia can still make absolutely filthy plays even at the age of 33.\n\nThat's enough praise.\n\nREAD MORE: Bask in the Orioles Magic this season\n\nAnywho, here are some more general musings — besides getting my tweet liked earlier this week by the OC's Spencer Pratt — from the Yards:\n\nMatt Wieters is totally leaving and we're kinda chill with that\n\nOK, so besides my friend Erin (who, to her benefit has a fantastic view of his backside from her fourth row seats) I'm not sure we're going to be totally sad when the Orioles and Matt Wieters part ways at the end of 2016. Discounting his last two seasons where he combined for 101 games, Matt's never hit over .270 in any season since his rookie year in 2009 where he hit .288 in 96 games. And during that time he's never hit over 23 home runs or more than 83 RBIs despite that lackluster average. His caught stealing percentage of .375 is fifth-best in baseball and his general defense has been pretty good (one passed ball, but a career-high 35 wild pitches) as usual.\n\nBut this season following the one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer has been meh. And with Chance Sisco, Caleb Joseph, and Audry Perez still in the system things won't go too, too haywire.\n\nAlso the expert opinion from Ms. Erin Bounds dealing with the # BirdlandPowerCo Omoji T-shirt night confirms this to be a fact. A lack of All-Star catcher (though there's sadly no Zach Britton or Hyun Soo Kim ... or Wayne Kirby for that matter) on the trendy emoji shirt says the O's are phasing out their \"Country Boy.\"\n\nEven more chill than our thoughts on Wieters? Boog\n\nTuesday was actually my second time meeting the pit beef-fueled mountain of a man who is Boog Powell! The first time was during the 2014 ALDS, the day Delmon Young smacked his miraculous left field corner hit, which was hopefully fueled by said pit beef. This time Boog was drinking a Diet Coke with \"We Are Family\" lyrics on the label. I told him that although I really enjoy the 1979 Sister Sledge hit, the connection to the 1979 World Series warrants a trip to the trash can.

I think the biggest loss was intermingling with tourists during the spring and early summer. A few days ago, during a rather foggy morning, I took a walk on Long Sands Beach and overheard a couple questioning each other about what they could possibly do on a foggy, damp day at the beach. They seemed saddened in the thought their vacation would be interrupted by what they considered to be bad weather.\n\nI interrupted their conversation by stating they were very lucky to have vacationed when a coastal fog was in. I think they were from some Midwest state because they had a funny accent. The couple took me to task by asking what they could do. Since I was in the mood to sound like an old \"Downeaster\" I told them a favorite tale of the coast.\n\nGet here real early in the morning right before the sun breaks away from the horizon. Find where the water meets the shore and follow its sound and smell. It might be a bit damp but don’t be afraid to get a little wet. Remember you are on the coast of Maine, and you are supposed to get a little wet.\n\nAngels walk among us:Maine man's home gets extreme makeover thanks to volunteers\n\nNow walk the beach and listen to the music of the coast. The ocean sounds totally different in the early morning especially in the fog. The dense atmosphere makes everything echo. The water hitting the sands makes the sound of heavy blankets being curled up by thankful people in the dead of winter. This sound has a tendency to make one shiver a bit, but it is a good kind of shiver.\n\nYour footsteps sound different on the sands of a foggy morning. They echo like the sound of forest leaves fighting for space with each other during a summer storm. If there are other people on the beach, notice that they end up walking in unison. No one ever steps out of time. I assume this is respecting the sand's legacy to control the sounds of the beach. It could also be that it is the couple’s turn to become one, in a different sort of way. A remarkably fantastic sort of way.\n\nTom Cruise's latest mission:Restoring the all-American summer blockbuster season with 'Top Gun'\n\nWhen you hit the parts of the beach that have rocks you will hear the sound of conversations between what has always been and hopefully always will be. The larger rocks scream their song in total unison with the pounding waves. However, the sound I enjoy most is the little pebbles laughing as the ocean tickles them over and over again. It is their time on the beach. We are only allowed to listen.\n\nThe gulls on a foggy beach are seen quietly waiting their time when the sun will burn-off the fog and people will return to feed and play with them again. They are seen in small and large groups seemingly praying to the ocean that gave them life.\n\nYork and Ogunquit beaches:Here's what's new in 2022- Shops, eateries, shows and more\n\nBy this time, I was either scaring the hell out of these people or was interesting them with my tale. However, it was soon my time to go on my way. I said farewell to my two new friends and started to walk down the sands.\n\nAs I was leaving, I heard the man call to me and ask if they would see me on the beach tomorrow morning. I turned around, smiled, and told him they probably would.\n\nJim Fabiano is a retired teacher and writer living in York, Maine.

This double emergence is the first time this has happened in 221 years. According to ScienceAlert.com, this won't happen again until 2245.\n\nOf all the states where the broods will emerge this year, they are expected to overlap in Illinois and Indiana.\n\nYou may remember the last brood of cicadas, Brood X, which emerged in the summer of 2021 across multiple Eastern, Southern and Midwestern states.\n\nHere's what to know about this year's two cicada broods.\n\nWhat are Brood XIX cicadas?\n\nBrood XIX (19) is estimated to emerge in these states beginning mid-May and lasting through late June:\n\nAlabama.\n\nArkansas.\n\nGeorgia.\n\nIllinois.\n\nIndiana.\n\nKentucky.\n\nLouisiana.\n\nMississippi.\n\nMissouri.\n\nNorth Carolina.\n\nOklahoma.\n\nSouth Carolina.\n\nTennessee.\n\nVirginia.\n\nThe brood last emerged in 2011, and has a 13-year life cycle.\n\nAccording to Cicada Mania, they will begin to emerge when the soil 8 inches underground reaches 64 degrees, and are often triggered by a warm rain.\n\nWhat are Brood XIII cicadas?\n\nBrood XIII (13) will emerge these states in mid-May and ending in late June:\n\nIllinois.\n\nIndiana.\n\nIowa.\n\nWisconsin.\n\nThe brood may also appear in Michigan, Cicada Mania says. Like Brood XIX, they will begin to emerge when the soil 8 inches underground reaches 64 degrees, and are often triggered by a warm rain.\n\nUnlike the other brood, these cicadas have a 17-year life cycle, and last emerged in 2007.\n\nWhat is the life cycle of a cicada?\n\nCicadas have the longest life cycle of any insect, waiting 13 or 17 years to emerge, but once they're above ground, things move pretty fast. Female cicadas lay eggs in trees, which drop to the ground and burrow, waiting for years to emerge, depending on their brood.\n\nOnce they emerge, adults cicadas will mate, lay millions of eggs and die, all in about five weeks.\n\nWhat is the difference between annual and periodical cicadas?\n\nThere are two types of cicadas that are common in Eastern U.S. states: Annual and periodical cicadas. Annual cicadas emerge every year, while periodical cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWhat is a brood?\n\nAccording to the University of Connecticut, broods are classified as \"all periodical cicadas of the same life cycle type that emerge in a given year.\"\n\nA brood of cicadas is made up of different species of the insect that have separate evolutionary histories. These species may have joined the brood at different times or from different sources. These different species are lumped together under the brood because they are in the same region and emerge on a common schedule.\n\nThe two cicada broods set to emerge this summer are both periodical broods, which the University of Connecticut says fits together \"like puzzle pieces, in both time and space.\"\n\nWhy do cicadas make so much noise?\n\nYou'll have to thank the male cicadas for all that screeching. Male cicadas synchronize their calls and produce congregational songs, according to Britannica, which establish territory and attract females. There is also a courting call that they make before mating.\n\nUnluckily for us, the 13-year and 17-year brood cicadas are the loudest, partially because of the sheer number of them that emerge at once.\n\nAre cicadas harmful to humans or pets?\n\nCicadas are not harmful to humans, pets, household gardens or crops, the EPA says, and despite their overwhelming numbers, can actually provide a few environmental benefits.\n\nThey provide a valuable food source for birds or other predators, can aerate lawns, improve water filtration and add nutrients into the soil as they decompose.\n\nAre cicadas dangerous?Here's what's fact and fiction with cicada bites, stings and more.\n\nContributing: Joyce Orlando, Nashville Tennessean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/07/21/running-central-pa-run-trails-beach-feel-home-fresh-pond-delaware-seashore-state-park/8048196002/", "title": "Foot Notes: Hitting the beach trails to feel at home", "text": "Andy Sandrik\n\nFoot Notes\n\nIt was a weird feeling as I jetted down the Coastal Highway, away from my family at the beach and toward a place that felt more like home.\n\nIt had been a stressful morning along the ocean. The kids weren't exactly well behaved, and I was just struggling to settle in. It was too hot for me to sit comfortably, and when I waded deep into the waters, I could occasionally feel \"bites\" on the bottom of my feet, either from broken shells, claws, or perhaps one of the \"16 sharks\" that my 4-year-old saw (a gentleman explained to us that those were dolphins).\n\nI tried to free myself from the unsettling feelings on my 10-mile drive, which slogged on for 40 minutes through endless stoplights and pedestrian crosswalks. The trip ended with a few turns down back roads, and when I reached my destination, I could feel a wave of relief sweep over me.\n\nThere were no buildings or busy streets, rather trees, trails, and just enough sand to remind me I'm near a beach. There were no tourists or party animals in sight, just a couple of locals: A high school-aged runner who zipped into the woods, and a woman offering a wave while packing up her bicycle to leave.\n\nThis is my first time running the trails at Fresh Pond, a part of Delaware Seashore State Park, and within minutes, I'm in love. I start my run with a slow jog and melt away into the trails, most of which are lined with abundant sand cacti and surrounded by trees providing desperately-needed shade. The birds are singing, while the dime-sized horse flies are doing their best to ruin my jaunt through the forest. I won't let them.\n\nGo explore:Central Pa. summer guide: Hikes from hard to easy and family-friend trails\n\nFor a stretch of about 15-20 minutes, I'm completely at ease and living completely in the moment. But of course it can't be a Sandrik family vacation without me taking myself into \"deep waters.\" My body and phone — hovering at 15 percent charge — hit the wall at about the same time. My shirt is completely soaked, and I can feel the heat and humidity bearing down on me ever harder with each step.\n\nEvery fork in the trails comes with a decision and I double- and triple-check to make sure I'm not running away from the path I started on. Still, doubt creeps in, and I stop my run at the 5K mark to make sure I have enough energy to get back to the car. I wave down a bicyclist and ask him if the end of the trail is near, to which he responds, \"You're already there.\"\n\nI perk up and go back into a jog. The parking lot materializes within seconds. I am so happy knowing that I am minutes away from air-conditioning, and even happier that there is no one around to hear my loud gasps for air.\n\nMore:Get outside in PA this summer - the adventure awaits in lakes, forests and state parks\n\nI consider myself a fairly experienced and well-conditioned runner, but running in a beach climate is something that takes more than a weekend to get used to. I'm zapped once again, but I also have a feeling of accomplishment. I was able to explore a new place, log some meaningful miles, and for once, get some quiet time.\n\nWith my workout out of the way, my anxiety transforms into an eagerness to do what I came here to do: Relax and spend time with my family. In a beach chair with a cold drink in hand, I'm once again able to peacefully live in the moment, except for when the kids are fighting over the last juice box.\n\nGet out:Check out 12 day trips for families to take in the region\n\nMy time at the beach will be over by the time this column goes to print, and I know that I'll be fully focused on returning to my home and work routines. I also know there's a part of me that will miss the ocean, mini golf, and fantastic food. And now trails.\n\nFamily vacations always carry a certain level of stress, but I find myself more willing than ever to plan the next trip, knowing there's always a trail around the corner to make me feel more at home.\n\nPoole family affair at triathlon; Ball one marathon away from 50-state milestone\n\nSeveral weeks ago, we detailed the exploits of USA Duathlon national champion Rick Poole of York.\n\nPoole, 75, returned to action at the New Jersey State Triathlon, and this time, he was joined by two other generations of family members: His son, Keith, and daughter, Kelly, as well as his granddaughter Olivia. Poole finished first among family members with a 1:22:58, while Kelly (1:24:17), Keith (1:24:50), and Olivia (1:25:04) were not far behind.\n\nWhile Poole got to celebrate family racing time, Daniel Kirk of Blaine, Minn. exacted a bit of revenge from duathlon nationals, defeating Poole for the AG win by one second.\n\nMore:Foot Notes: 'You just have to get off your butt': Central Pa. man isn't slowing down at 75\n\nn East Berlin, Hanover's Matthew Martino and York's Anthony Roselli each logged Top 3 finishes at the Summerfest 5K, which was won in 15:22 by Fort Washington (Md.) runner Omari Daughtridge in 15:22.\n\nMartino finished in 16:07 and Roselli crossed in 17:40, while Dillsburg's Joanna Hayes finished as the second female in 18:53.

And summer means the beach to many: a time to play in the sun, build castles in the sand, and swim in some cool blue water. From golden beaches circling lakes to swaths of white sand fronting salty turquoise-tinged ocean, here are our 10 top picks for the best beaches to salute summer on this Memorial Day weekend.\n\nSt. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla.\n\nOne of the top beaches in the country, Clearwater Beach in the St. Petersburg area is perfect for a classic beach getaway. It's home to pristine, white sand beaches and warm water, and features Pier 60, which hosts a nightly sunset festival on the Clearwater Beach Pier, complete with live music, street performers, vendors and splendid views across the gulf. Also in the area is Fort de Soto Park, which is a great beach option for families with either two or four-legged children – there's a natural sandbar area that forms a lagoon-like pool for kids to swim in safely, and also a Paw Playground and Dog Beach for canine family members. And if your Memorial Day plans usually include a BBQ, there are grills in the park for epic cookouts.\n\nAmelia Island, Fla.\n\nFlorida is a great state for Memorial Day beach celebrations because it's warm enough to swim in May. Amelia Island off the state's northeast corner is a fun and accessible destination with more than 40 public beach access points along 13 miles of coastline. It's a charming little island with plenty of dining, shopping and activity options, making it a great place for families, not to mention the miles of palm-lined bike paths, dunes rolling down into wide stretches of beach and clear, blue ocean for swimming. There are dozens of hotels to choice from. Spoil yourself with a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, which is poised on a bluff of dunes overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIndiana Dunes State Park​, Chesterton, Ind.\n\nBeaches don't always border oceans; some of the best border lakes. And in Chesterton, Ind., you'll find Indiana Dunes State Park, which includes 15-miles of gold sand beaches strewn along the shores of Lake Michigan. What makes this state park such an ideal Memorial Day beach destination is it provides two experiences in one: There's the lake to play in and on, and then there are 70 miles of hiking trails to experience as well. Memorial Day weekend is extra special at Indiana Dunes State Park, with a sunset hike on Friday, a guided 3 Dune Challenge hike, a scavenger hunt and a birds and blooms hike on Saturday, and several other programs over the holiday weekend.\n\nLincoln City Beach, Lincoln City, Ore.\n\nHeading out west, Lincoln City is located approximately two hours southwest of Portland, along a beautiful 7.5-mile pristine stretch of Oregon Coast that includes one of the longest beaches in the state. Although this isn't really a swimming beach destination, Lincoln City stands out as a great Memorial Day beach destination for beach walkers and combers. Keep your eyes on the sand while strolling, as you may discover everything from driftwood to seashells to glass treasures. Every day from mid-October through Memorial Day, anonymous volunteers known as \"Float Fairies\" hide colorful hand-made glass art along the beach. And the rule is that whoever finds the art can keep it. On Memorial Day weekend an extra 100 pieces of glass art are hidden to celebrate the end of the season, and a party is thrown with a jumbo float on the beach and a treasure hunt leading to a weekend getaway prize.\n\nLong Beach, N.Y.\n\nFrom beach volleyball to a free summer concert series, Long Beach, one of only two cities on Long Island, is another unspoiled Memorial Day celebration spot. With the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Reynolds Channel on the other, it is a beautifully situated seaside community that boasts a 3.5 mile long beach considered one of the cleanest in the USA. Memorial Day kicks off the summer season in town, and the city is home to all sorts of adventure opportunities including flying on a recreational trapeze school, experiencing the state-of-the-art surf center, playing a few rounds of mini golf courses or just wandering down the two-plus-mile boardwalk filled with all sorts of eating options.\n\nBrigantine Beach, N.J.\n\nIf you live between Washington D.C. and New York City and you're looking for an East Coast beach to explore this Memorial Day, consider heading to Brigantine Beach in New Jersey. It's kind of the anti-Jersey Shore, the exact opposite of towns like Seaside Heights. Just north via bridge from Atlantic City, it's a quaint, local beach town that awakens over Memorial Day weekend. Clean, family-friendly and all around chill, it's a bit of an undiscovered gem in the state. Wander up from 14th Street beach to Laguna Grill for a rum runner to sip in the sand, or if you'd rather have an ice cream, brave the line at Auntie B's. For evening celebrations, the jetty on the south end is a front-and-center seat for the fireworks over the casinos, without having to deal with the Atlantic City hubbub.\n\nPoipu Beach, Kauai, Hawaii\n\nFor one of the most exotic and beautiful beach destinations in the USA, head to Poipu Beach in Kauai this Memorial Day. It's considered one of the best beaches in the world, and offers a delightful environment for swimming, surfing, boogie boarding, snorkeling or simply relaxing. It’s also a very family friendly destination, and considered one of Hawaii's safest beaches with lifeguards on duty 7 days a week and shallow waters for kids to swim. It's a picture perfect beach too, with all white sand, palm trees and some of Hawaii’s most stunning views. Humpback whales, sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals can also often be spotted.\n\nHermosa Beach, Calif.\n\nSouthern California is synonymous with great beach towns, and Hermosa Beach is no exception. The perfect seaside town to experience the region's quintessential laid-back Cali lifestyle, Hermosa Beach is especially fun over Memorial Day weekend when it throws its annual Fiesta Hermosa, now in its 44th year. The festival draws some 100,000 people and 300 vendors from painters to jewelers, which also makes it the largest arts and crafts festival in SoCal. Best of all, Hermosa Beach is located just 5 miles south of LAX, which means if you're flying in there's no need to rent a car as it's a short Uber ride from the airport.\n\nHilton Head Island, S.C.\n\nHilton Head has long been one of the top beach towns in the country, and Memorial Day weekend marks the start of the season on the shoe shaped island measuring 12 miles long by 5 miles wide. Beyond unique hard pack sand that makes its beaches perfect for running, biking or strolls as the sun rises and sets, the resort town has also undergone a lot of renovation recently, meaning whatever resort you book, you're likely to be lodging in newly renovated digs. It's also home to restaurants, shops and activities to meet all tastes and budgets, and works well whether you're on your honeymoon or an extended family holiday.\n\nDuck Beach, Duck, N.C.\n\nIn North Carolina's beautiful Outer Banks area, Duck sits on a narrow barrier stretch of land that's another great Memorial Day weekend beach destination. With over six miles of white sand beaches, it offers uninterrupted ocean views and an abundance of open space on the sand to gather with friends or family and kick of the summer season. When you've finished soaking up the sun and sand, head to the town waterfront, which stretches for nearly a mile along the Currituck Sound, and is especially beautiful at sunrise and sunset. In Duck itself there are dozens upon dozens of unique dining and shopping experiences, as well as plenty of lodging options.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/neptune-wall/ocean-grove/2024/02/05/ocean-grove-nj-beach-access-judge-religion-church-state/71122186007/", "title": "Church vs. state on Ocean Grove beach: Date set when judge may ...", "text": "The Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association established the Jersey Shore town in 1869 and says its mission is to keep it a place for \"meditation, reflection and renewal.\"\n\nThe Camp Meeting Association lost some of its governing powers to Neptune Township in 1979, but still owns most of the land, including the boardwalk and beach.\n\nA state judge will soon decide whether the Camp Meeting Association can be forced to allow access to the beach from its boardwalk on Sunday mornings.\n\nOCEAN GROVE - The first time Norma Tolliver set foot here 20 years ago, she was so enchanted by the Methodist town that she decided to buy the Main Avenue Galleria and turn it into a showcase for local artists.\n\nSince then, she has watched the secular community co-exist peacefully with the religious community.

They enjoy feasting on tiny crustaceans, plankton and small fish, and live at the surface of the ocean and in shallow coastline waters.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide, about 12,000 of which live in the Atlantic Ocean. The agency declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2016 after an unusual number of whales were found dead or stranded on East Coast beaches. To date, 79 humpback whales have washed ashore from Florida to Maine as part of that mortality event.\n\nFun fact: Humpback whales can live about 80 to 90 years in the wild, and are known to migrate 5,000 miles per year.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale\n\nKnown as one of the rarest whale species in the world, the North Atlantic right whale can reach about 50 feet in length and weigh up to 140,000 pounds. They also feast on tiny marine life, largely zooplankton. While they were once found in all of the world’s oceans, they now mainly live in the North Atlantic.\n\nNOAA estimates there are fewer than 500 right whales left, making the species critically endangered. The agency declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2017 when 17 whales were found dead in Canada and the United States.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales threatened by climate change and human encounters\n\nFun fact: A characteristic feature of this species is the raised patches of rough skin on their heads, called callosities, which appear white because of whale lice.\n\nMinke whale\n\nThis uniquely shaped whale can reach about 35 feet in length and weigh up to 20,000 pounds. It is another species known to breach the ocean’s surface and delight those lucky enough to be nearby. They feed on small marine animals, such as crustaceans, plankton and small fish and are largely found in temperate or cool waters.\n\nNOAA estimates there is a robust population of minke whales in the world, with about 2,500 living in the Atlantic. The agency also declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2017, and since then, 37 whales have been found dead or stranded on beaches from South Carolina to Maine.\n\nFun fact: Minke whales are the smallest of baleen whales, which are whales that have plates of whalebone in their mouths to strain plankton from the water.\n\nPilot whales\n\nBoth short-finned and long-finned pilot whales are known to frequent Delaware’s coast, following and feasting on squid. Short-finned pilot whales can reach up to 24 feet and weigh up to 6,600 pounds, while long-finned whales can reach 25 feet and about 5,000 pounds.\n\nNOAA estimates there are about 1,100 short-finned whales in the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Atlantic Ocean, while more than 8,000 long-finned whales are estimated to live in the Atlantic and 200,000 in the Antarctic.\n\nFun fact: Long-finned pilot whales can dive 2,000 feet deep for about 15 minutes to feed.\n\nSperm whale\n\nThe sperm whale and its smaller relative, the pygmy sperm whale, can be found worldwide, and live year-round in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Georges Bank.\n\nSperm whales can reach up to 52 feet in length and weigh up to 90,000 pounds. The smaller pygmy version reaches a maximum of about 12 feet and up to 1,000 pounds. Both enjoy feasting on squid, but are also known to hunt other fish. Pygmy sperm whales also enjoy the occasional crustacean.\n\nSperm whales enjoy deeper waters and are considered endangered, with an estimate of 450,000 left in worldwide waters. It is unclear how many pygmy sperm whales are left, but NOAA estimates there are about 1,000 in the Atlantic and in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFun fact: Sperm whales are named after a waxy substance found on their heads, which is called spermaceti. That substance was historically used for oil lamps, lubricants and candles.\n\nSei whale\n\nThis sleek swimmer can reach up to 60 feet in length and weigh up to 100,000 pounds. They usually live in deeper waters, but will follow their prey — which includes plankton and small crustaceans — into inshore waters.\n\nThey are considered endangered, and NOAA estimates there are about 8,600 sei whales in the northern Pacific Ocean, but it is unclear how many remain in other waters.\n\nFun fact: Sei whales can swim at speeds of 34 miles per hour or faster, and eat about 2,000 pounds of food per day.\n\nFin whale\n\nAs the largest whale species known to frequent Delaware’s coast, fin whales can reach up to 85 feet in length and weigh up to 160,000 pounds. They are known to be fast swimmers, and are usually found in deep, offshore waters around the world.\n\nFin whales are considered endangered, and NOAA estimates there are about 2,700 left in the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, about 3,200 in the eastern Pacific Ocean and a total of about 82,000 worldwide.\n\nFun fact: Fin whales sometimes mate with blue whales, and hybrids have been documented.\n\nOrca\n\nCommonly known as killer whales, orcas can reach up to 32 feet in length and weigh up to 22,000 pounds. They eat everything from fish and squid to birds, turtles and other marine mammals.\n\nThis species is considered uncommon and found worldwide. NOAA estimates there are fewer than 300 orcas in the Gulf of Mexico, but their population off the East Coast is largely unknown. It is estimated there are about 50,000 worldwide.\n\nFun fact: The killer whale, or orca, is the largest member of the Delphinidae family, which are oceanic dolphins. Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales also belong to this family.\n\nIf you see a whale\n\nOccasionally, large whales wash ashore on Delaware’s beaches, where they can create quite a stir. Marine stranding experts advise people and pets to keep their distance, because the stranded whale — dead or alive — could carry diseases.\n\nAnyone who sees a whale in distress in the water or on the shore should immediately call the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute’s 24-hour hotline at (302) 228-5029.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nSOUTHERN DELAWARE NEWS\n\nAs Delaware coastal waters warm, risk of deadly bacteria rises\n\nCape Henlopen shows 'lack of urgency' in hiring more minority teachers, group says\n\nDogs surrendered by Georgetown backyard breeder ready for adoption at local SPCA", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/15"}]}

This is legendary,” game MVP Patrick Mahomes said after the win.\n\nAnd if anyone needed any confirmation this is the start of a dynasty, look no further than Mahomes himself.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“It’s the start of one. We aren’t done,” the now three-time Super Bowl champion quarterback said.\n\nKansas City was able to send the game into overtime in the final seconds of regulation thanks to a Harrison Butker field goal. The 49ers got the ball to start the extra period and got a field goal, but with the new overtime rules, the Chiefs were allowed to get the ball. Then, Mahomes engineered the drive of the season, capped off by a three-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Mecole Hardman to win it all.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s déjà vu for the 49ers, once again blowing a 10-point lead against Kansas City in the title game after doing it in Super Bowl 54. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCHIEFS FANS: Here’s where you can buy the Super Bowl 58 commemorative cover\n\nMost likeable Super Bowl ever. Chiefs, Usher almost make you forget about hating NFL\n\nSuper Bowl 58 really started with Usher. His show took us back in time to old school rhythm and blues, in what was the most gorgeous, stunning Super Bowl halftime show ever. Usher pulled off a neat trick: sensuality and likeability wrapped into a neat, bombastic bow.\n\nThen came the game, and it really started with the second half. And we saw what makes Kansas City so good: stubbornness and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBut after Kansas City won, we saw from that team what we always do: a bunch of likeable people.\n\nBetween Usher, who put on a stunning and likeable show, and Kansas City, who in the end put on an equally stunning and likeable show, this was the most likeable Super Bowl of all time. Read Mike Freeman's full column here.\n\nChiefs' Travis Kelce packs drama into Super Bowl, from blowup with coach to late heroics\n\nIf the main character of the NFL this year was Travis Kelce, then the script writers saved his most dramatic episode for the 2023 season finale.\n\nKelce’s Super Bowl story arc was dramatic enough to be an appropriate coda of the 21-game soap opera that was the Kansas City Chiefs' season. He entered with high expectations. Faced adversity. There was redemption and triumph. It was punctuated by an Elvis Presley impersonation, fitting for the first Super Bowl in Las Vegas.\n\n“Vivaaaaaaaaaaaa, Vivaaaaaaaa, Las Vegasssssssssssssss!!” a hoarse Kelce, Lombardi Trophy in hand, scream-sang into the microphone as CBS’ Jim Nantz interviewed him on stage. As is the wont of a leading man, Kelce played a pivotal role in Super Bowl 58. Read Chris Bumbaca's full story on Kelce here.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 2025? New Orleans set to host Super Bowl 59\n\nThe NFL is headed back to \"The Big Easy.\" Super Bowl 59 will be held in New Orleans and played at the Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints. It marks the first time New Orleans will host the Super Bowl since 2013. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWe knew what was going to happen because we’ve seen it before. Several times. So how in the world did the 49ers not know what was coming?\n\nIt might as well be in the Chiefs’ playbook for Super Bowls: Play poorly, fall behind by double digits and, almost always, come back and win. It happened the first time the Chiefs and the Niners played. It happened last year against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAnd it happened again Sunday night. — Nancy Armour\n\nA Super Bowl winning drive that took 13 plays with Taylor Swift in attendance?\n\nBaby just say yes.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs secured their second consecutive Super Bowl title on Sunday after scoring a touchdown in overtime that was the drive of the season for Patrick Mahomes and company. It took 13 plays, seven minutes and 19 seconds for the Chiefs to get into the end zone, their longest drive of the day, and it was capped off by Mecole Hardman's touchdown. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl 58 winners and losers: Patrick Mahomes sparks dynasty, 49ers falter late\n\nThe dynasty otherwise known as the Kansas City Chiefs is here.\n\nThe Chiefs toppled the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58 on Sunday night in Las Vegas, 25-22, to become the first team in 19 seasons to repeat as Super Bowl champions. They have won three titles in the last half decade. And behind it all are the constants, coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who took home his third career Super Bowl MVP award, becoming only the third player in NFL history to do so.\n\nFor the 49ers and coach Kyle Shanahan, it's yet another heartbreak. There's plenty of blame to allocate, but one thing the 49ers should take comfort in is that quarterback Brock Purdy shined on the sport's biggest stage. Here are the winners and losers from Super Bowl 58. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n2024 NFL draft order: All 32 first-round selections set after Super Bowl 58\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime to win Super Bowl 58, thus officially ending the 2023 NFL season and setting the full order for the first round of the 2024 draft. Teams eliminated in the conference championship games pick at Nos. 29 and 30. Teams eliminated during the divisional playoffs occupy spots Nos. 25-28. Teams that lost during wild-card weekend are in spots Nos. 19-24. The non-playoff portion of the draft order is determined by regular-season record and uses strength of schedule as a tiebreaker (record and strength of schedule are official tiebreakers to determine the draft order). The 2024 NFL draft is scheduled to be held in Detroit from April 25-27. See the full order here. — Jim Reineking\n\nMecole Hardman reaction to scoring Super Bowl-winner TD: 'I blacked out'\n\nMecole Hardman scored the game-winning touchdown of Super Bowl 58. It took a bit before any of that registered.\n\nOn the game’s final play, the fifth-year receiver of the Kansas City Chiefs motioned toward the offensive line before pirouetting and looking back at quarterback Patrick Mahomes at the snap. The three-time Super Bowl MVP delivered a quick pass to the receiver, Hardman gathering the ball in and heading toward the pylon for a short 3-yard score that will be long remembered as the play that cemented K.C. as the NFL’s newest dynasty.\n\nNot that Hardman knew.\n\n“I knew I was going to get the ball, caught the football, and I blacked out,” said Hardman after the game. “I’m not going to lie, I blacked out.

It happened again.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers not only fell 25-22 to the Kansas City Chiefs in an overtime thriller in Super Bowl 58, but they did it the hard way, blowing a double-digit lead.\n\nYes, history has repeated itself. The Chiefs rallied from a 10-point deficit the last time the teams met in a Super Bowl, four years ago, and they've done it again in becoming first repeat champion in 19 years. Read Jarrett Bell's full column here.\n\n49ers praise Brock Purdy, bemoan 'self-inflicted wounds' in Super Bowl 58 loss\n\nThe 49ers also had high praise for Purdy, who played in his first Super Bowl. He became a national sensation last year when he stepped in as the third-string quarterback and led the team to the NFC championship. Among his admirers is retired Super Bowl champion Drew Brees.\n\nIn his own Super Bowl, Purdy went 23-of-38 passing for 255 yards and threw the touchdown to Jennings. He opened the season with five straight games without throwing an interception and protected the ball again in the title matchup.\n\n“I thought he did a great job,” Kittle said. “Just throughout the game, I haven’t watched the tape or anything like that, but Brock seemed like his normal self. Delivering the ball when he needed to, put it in tight coverages, I think Brock played a hell of a game.” Read Victoria Hernandez's full story here.\n\nLAS VEGAS — It was hardly a smooth coronation Sunday evening, but after nearly four hours, numerous momentum swings and only the second overtime in Super Bowl history, the Kansas City Chiefs were finally anointed as the NFL’s newest dynasty.\n\nAnd Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Co. more than earned the crown.\n\nDynasty? No doubt. — Nate Davis\n\nSuper Bowl 58 highlights\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the 49ers in overtime, becoming the NFL’s ninth repeat Super Bowl champs.\n\nCBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson interviewed Patrick Mahomes on the field right after the final whistle.\n\n\"The guys never faltered,\" Mahomes said to CBS' Tracy Wolfson on the sideline. \"This is awesome. It’s legendary.\" Wolfson then asked the Super Bowl 58 MVP if the Chiefs are now a dynasty. \"Yeah. It’s the start of one,\" he replied. \"We’re not done. We’ve got a young team we’re going to keep this thing going.\"\n\nDuring the postgame Lombardi Trophy presentation on the podium, Mahomes said the Super Bowl was a reflection of the Chiefs' whole season. \"It was the defense just keeping us in there and then the offense making plays when it counted,\" he said. \"And then, of course, Harrison Butker hitting it from about 70. So it was a microcosm of our whole season. I'm just proud of the guys, they kept believing. And I'm proud of the coaches for calling up those plays that got us some touchdowns there at the end.\n\n\"Just know that the Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that.\"\n\nTravis Kelce opened his comments during the postgame trophy presentation by shouting “Chiefs Kingdom!\" before leading the call-and-response cheer of “Viva Las Vegas” with the crowd.\n\nKelce then looked ahead to what's next, saying the Chiefs have their sights on a third-straight Super Bowl victory. “Well, you know, the goal’s always been to get three, but we couldn’t here without getting to two and having that target on our back all year — and I love these guys right here, the men that we just won this thing with, family forever, baby,\" he said. \"I couldn’t be more proud of you guys, and how about it? We get a chance to do it three times in a row. How do you get excited for that, baby? You party in Las Vegas and then you get back to it.”\n\nHe then led the crowd in a “You gotta fight for your right to party” cheer.\n\nSuper Bowl 2024 Gatorade color\n\nThe Chiefs showered coach Andy Reid with purple Gatorade after their Super Bowl 58 victory. Here's a complete history of Super Bowl Gatorade baths.\n\nLAS VEGAS — Kyle Shanahan with a 10-point lead in a Super Bowl?\n\nGiven the history, this is not what the casinos on The Strip would call playing with house money.\n\nUh-oh. It happened again.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers not only fell 25-22 to the Kansas City Chiefs in an overtime thriller in Super Bowl 58, but they did it the hard way, blowing a double-digit lead.\n\nYes, history has repeated itself. — Jarrett Bell\n\nPatrick Mahomes won Super Bowl 58 MVP as the quarterback led the Kansas City Chiefs to their third title in five years by beating the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime Sunday.\n\nMahomes won the award for the third time in his career. He now is tied with Hall of Famer Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs in NFL history, trailing only Tom Brady, who won five. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker broke a record set by San Francisco 49ers kicker Jake Moody earlier in the game, making a 57-yard field goal attempt in the third quarter. Moody had briefly held the record, which had been held by the Buffalo Bills' Steve Christie (Super Bowl XXVIII), making a 55-yard field goal in the second quarter.\n\nButker connected on four field goal attempts, which tied a Super Bowl record held by the 49ers' Ray Wersching (Super Bowl XVI) and the Green Bay Packers' Don Chandler (Super Bowl II). — Jim Reineking\n\nThe bets were pouring in across the country for Super Bowl 58. And while there were some big boons for bettors during the big game, there were also several moments that spoiled some popular wagers made with BetMGM.\n\nHere are five bad beats that irked a significant number of bettors Sunday night. — Richard Morin\n\nWinners and losers of overtime\n\nWINNERS\n\nLegendary Mahomes\n\nIf he wasn’t already established as an all-time great, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes erased any doubt whatsoever that he is among the best to have ever done it. His uncanny feel for the game and pocket presence, taking stock of where the open spaces on the field are, using his arm or his legs, this is what has allowed the Chiefs to be the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls. The scary part, for the rest of the NFL, at least, Mahomes is only 28 and entering his prime.\n\nChiefs O-line\n\nThough they had been controlled for the majority of the game, Kansas City’s offensive line parried away the 49ers pass rushers in second half. Mahomes’ increased mobility certainly helped neutralize the bite of some of the San Francisco pressure, but Kansas City’s front protected Mahomes plenty on Kansas City’s 13-play, 75-yard game-winning drive. Chiefs gained 208 of their 455 yards — or 45.7% of their offensive output — in the fourth quarter and overtime. It’s no coincidence that this is the time when the Chiefs’ offensive line took over.\n\nLOSERS\n\n49ers defense simply ran out of gas\n\nThis was certainly an example of the inevitability of Patrick Mahomes, as it appeared there would be no doubt the Chiefs would score every time they touched the ball late. But San Francisco’s defense, an elite unit, appeared to lose a step as the game wore on. The injury to Dre Greenlaw contributed, but San Francisco playing soft coverage, perhaps to compensate for fatigue, allowed Mahomes to pick apart the coverages. It also meant that when San Francisco’s defenders dropped back, Mahomes had space to run and gain huge chunks of yards. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs 25, 49ers 22: Kansas City wins Super Bowl 58 in overtime\n\nThe Mahomes magic knows no bounds, and now the Chiefs have their third Super Bowl title in five years.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found Mecole Hardman to cap a 13-play, 75-yard drive and help the Chiefs outlast the 49ers in thrilling fashion.\n\nOn third-and-1, Isiah Pacheco was stopped for no gain, which forced KC to go for it. Then, on a designed run, Patrick Mahomes ran for 8 yards and a first down to keep the Chiefs alive.\n\nAfter a busted play lost 3 yards, Mahomes found Marques Valdes-Scantling for 7 yards and Rashee Rice for 13 yards and a first down into 49ers territory.\n\nMahomes came back with a 19-yard run on third-and-1, being tackled at the 49ers 13. Three plays later the were in the end zone. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 22, Chiefs 19: Jake Moody puts San Francisco head in overtime\n\nThe 49ers’ opening drive in overtime initially didn’t go well. Brock Purdy’s first pass was almost intercepted. Then, on second down, there was a false start. Later in the drive, on third down, a Purdy pass fell incomplete.\n\nBut San Francisco got a huge break with a holding call on Kansas City.\n\nPurdy took advantage of the penalty and started to slowly move the ball down the field. They did so with tight end George Kittle going into the locker room with what CBS said was a shoulder injury. He returned just several minutes later.\n\nSan Francisco took over seven minutes to move deep into Kansas City territory. The drive ended with a Jake Moody field goal from 27 yards. — Mike Freeman\n\nGeorge Kittle injury update\n\nThe 49ers are in overtime of the Super Bowl and experiencing another injury scare.\n\nTight end George Kittle was seen jogging to the locker room during the extra session. CBS sideline reporter Evan Washburn said Kittle was dealing with a right shoulder injury.\n\nKittle was questionable to return but was back on the field later in the 49ers' drive. — Jace Evans\n\nThe NFL's overtime rules for the Super Bowl and postseason have evolved over the years, with the most recent tweak coming in 2022.\n\nThe Super Bowl overtime format is quite similar to what fans are accustomed to in the regular season, with two significant exceptions: Both teams will have the chance to possess the ball and games cannot end in ties. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThere's only been one other Super Bowl to go into overtime\n\nThe New England Patriots' epic win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI was the only previous Super Bowl to go into overtime.\n\nOf course, that game ended on James White's touchdown to win the game for the Patriots, who overcame a 28-3 deficit to force overtime. — Jim Reineking\n\nFourth quarter winners and losers\n\nWINNERS\n\nOffensive execution\n\nThis Super Bowl was something of a late bloomer. It took until the fourth quarter, but both teams easily recorded their best offensive quarters of the game. Each of the four possessions both teams combined to play ended up scores. Both teams combined for 248 yards of offense. Most importantly for fans: the alternating scores ended up with the game tied, giving us an intriguing conclusion to a game that had started slowly\n\nThat Steve Spagnuolo blitz\n\nComing out of the two-minute warning, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo dialed up a perfect blitz that had slot corner Trent McDuffie firing off the edge. Brock Purdy, feeling the heat of the Kansas City rush, fired a quick pass to Jauan Jennings, but McDuffie threw up his hands and deflected the ball. That set up rookie kicker Jake Moody’s 53-yard go-ahead kick, but it gave the Chiefs plenty of time to tie or win the game.\n\nLOSERS\n\nThe second down that preceded it\n\n49ers coach Kyle Shanahan has called a decently solid game, though he did ignore Christian McCaffrey and the running game in the third quarter. With the two-minute warning approaching, Shanahan and the 49ers were facing a second-and-5 from the Kansas City 35-yard line. The play was a pass to tight end George Kittle that went for no gain, setting up a difficult third down, and giving Spagnuolo a perfect chance to bring pressure. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n49ers 19, Chiefs 19: Harrison Butker ties it with three seconds left\n\nIt looks like the Super Bowl is going to overtime for only the second time ever after Harrison Butker made a 29-yard field goal with 3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe drive started when Patrick Mahomes hit Travis Kelce on a 9-yard pass before scrambling for a first down. Then Mahomes found Justin Watson for 8 yards and, on third-and-2, got a pass to Jerick McKinnon for 7 yards to the 49ers 43-yard line with 40 seconds to play.\n\nThe most clutch play came on third-and-7, when Mahomes found Travis Kelce for a 22-yard catch and run to to 49ers 11. That's where the drive ended before Butker's fourth field goal of Super Bowl 58. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 19, Chiefs 16: Jake Moody gives San Francisco late lead\n\nJake Moody missed an extra point on a previous 49ers touchdown but he was ice on what could be the game-deciding kick.\n\nThis one was from 53 yards and he showed no signs of being nervous. The kick was perfect. — Mike Freeman\n\n49ers 16, Chiefs 16: Harrison Butker ties it up\n\nLess than six minutes left in Super Bowl 58, and it’s all knotted up at 16 after Harrison Butker hit his third field goal of the day.\n\nTravis Kelce has been relatively quiet most of Sunday, but came up big with two catches for 29 yards, including on a third-and-10 play to keep the chains moving. Another big play was when Patrick Mahomes found Justin Watson for a 25-yard gain to get them near the red zone.\n\nKansas City was able to get inside the 10-yard line, but wasn’t able to punch it in and had to settle for a 24-yard field goal for the tie. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTravis Kelce receiving yards today\n\nAfter having just one catch for 1 yard in the first half, Travis Kelce's production picked up in the second half.\n\nKelce had nine receptions for 93 yards, with his final catch setting up the Chiefs' game-winning touchdown in overtime.\n\n49ers 16, Chiefs 13: Jauan Jennings scores, but Jake Moody's extra point blocked\n\nOn fourth down, Shanahan decided to go for it and it paid off with a pass to tight end George Kittle, who got the first. Then Jauan Jennings later scored and it looked like the 49ers were going to lead Kansas City, 17-13.\n\nBut kicker Jake Moody missed the extra point and it was instead 16-13. CBS noted that Moody was previously 68 for 68.\n\nThe touchdown for San Francisco reversed what was a terrible third quarter. With 2:23 remaining in it, San Francisco had 13 total yards, -1 passing yards, one giveaway and zero first downs. They were outscored at that point 10-0. — Mike Freeman\n\nWinners and losers from third quarter\n\nWINNERS\n\nMahomes mobility activated\n\nWith San Francisco dictating the line of scrimmage, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made a slight tweak to his game to generate some more momentum for Kansas City: he used his legs more. In the first half, he ran the ball just twice for seven yards. In the third quarter alone, he rushed three times for 26 yards, including a 22-yarder on a third down that set up Harrison Butker’s record-setting 57-yard field goal.\n\nSteve Wilks\n\nSan Francisco defensive coordinator Steve Wilks has his defense completely stifling Patrick Mahomes. The Niner defense is pressuring Mahomes and speeding up his entire operation. They’ve sacked Mahomes twice and have shut down Kansas City in two red zone trips. Mahomes’ third quarter interception was the result of controlled pressure complementing tight coverage down the field. The special teams gaffe close to the end of the third quarter put his defense in a tough spot, and while there was a breakdown in coverage, it’s difficult to fault Wilks’ unit for giving up the score on the short field.\n\nLOSERS\n\nSan Francisco offense stalling in second half\n\nThe 49ers recorded three complete drives in the third quarter. They ran nine plays, gained three yards and posted three three-and-outs. Surprisingly, coach Kyle Shanahan went away from San Francisco’s big strength and primary playmaker; in those three series, running back Christian McCaffrey carried the ball just once for no gain. The good news for the 49ers is that their current drive, which started at the end of the third and is heading into the fourth, appears to be a course correction.\n\nAnd their special teams imploded even worse\n\nIt’s so demoralizing for a defense to get a stop, only for the special teams unit to botch the punt return. That’s precisely what San Francisco did, when the punt caromed off the foot of rookie Darrell Luter Jr. and ended up with the Chiefs recovering. The Chiefs thrive when teams gift them opportunities like this, and Kansas City scored its first touchdown of the day on the following play. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs 13, 49ers 10: Muffed punt results in Marquez Valdes-Scantling TD\n\nAnother big mistake for the San Francisco 49ers leads to the Chiefs taking their first lead of the game.\n\nAfter forcing a three-and-out and a punt, one of the 49ers players appeared to touch Darrell Luter Jr. the ball on the punt, returner Ray-Ray McCloud III tried to pick it up, but he couldn’t get his hands fully on it and the Chiefs recovered it at the 16-yard line.\n\nOn the next play, Patrick Mahomes found Marquez Valdes-Scantling wide open in the end zone for Kansas City’s first touchdown of the day, and gave the Chiefs a 13-0 lead late in the third quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nLAS VEGAS — Two individuals rushed the field during the third quarter of Super Bowl 58 and nearly interrupted a third down play for the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense. One of the disruptors made it all the way to the San Francisco 49ers' sideline, where he was subdued, while his partner in crime — literally, this is trespassing — was tackled by a team of security staffers near the 10-yard line by the Chiefs’ end zone.\n\nBoth shirtless, they must have felt inspired by Usher’s halftime show. — Chris Bumbaca\n\n49ers’ Deebo Samuel returns\n\nThe good news for San Francisco: Deebo Samuel returned after injuring his hamstring.\n\nThe bad news for the 49ers: the offense had its third consecutive three-and-out.\n\nWhat’s become clear is that Kansas City’s defense, after not being able to significantly pressure Purdy in the first half, is doing so now. He’s been figured out. At least for the moment. — Mike Freeman\n\n49ers 10, Chiefs 6: Chiefs add another field goal with history\n\nEarlier in the game, Jake Moody made the longest field goal in Super Bowl history at 55 yards.\n\nThe record lasted one quarter.\n\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker knocked in a 57-yard field goal in the third quarter to break the record of longest field goal in Super Bowl history, and making it a 10-6 49ers lead with 20 minutes left in Super Bowl 58. Butker kicked a 28-yard field goal in the final seconds of the first half for Kansas City’s first points of the game.\n\nIt wasn’t a touchdown, but it was still a win for Kansas City to get points on the board since the offense has been dormant most of the game. The legs of Patrick Mahomes were instrumental in the drive, as he picked up a third down on a scramble and then had a 22-yard run to get the offense in San Francisco territory. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nDeebo Samuel hamstring injury update\n\nAfter seeing Dre Greenlaw go down with an Achilles injury, the San Francisco 49ers are holding their breath again after Deebo Samuel appeared to suffer an injury in the third quarter. The wide receiver was initially listed as questionable to return, but returned to the game.\n\nSamuel appeared to grab his hamstring area late on his route on the 49ers’ unsuccessful third down play, and he went to the grass at Allegiant Stadium with 9:15 remaining in the quarter.\n\nSamuel walked off the field under his own power and made his way to the blue medical tent. — Jace Evans\n\nChiefs once again go three-and-out, burn timeout\n\nIt’s been a struggle for Kansas City to move the ball, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better after another three-and-out, this time inside its own 10-yard line.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to make it a close third-and-one after Travis Kelce got his second catch of the day, but the 49ers stuffed Isiah Pacheco on third down after taking its first timeout of the second half. It would’ve been quite the gamble to go for it, so Andy Reid sent out the punting unit to give the ball back to San Francisco. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n49ers unable to take advantage of Patrick Mahomes INT\n\nSan Francisco missed a gigantic opportunity to take a commanding lead after the 49ers intercepted Patrick Mahomes. That didn’t happen as San Francisco was stopped and punted. However, the 49ers were able to bury Kansas City on its own 2-yard line on that kick.\n\nBy the way, Prince was previously the best Super Bowl halftime show, but Usher’s was better. Will not be taking any questions at this time. — Mike Freeman\n\nPatrick Mahomes picked off by 49ers on opening drive of second half\n\nThe Chiefs had a chance to tie the game out of halftime.\n\nInstead, the 49ers will be getting great field position.\n\nSafety Ji'Ayir Brown picked off Patrick Mahomes on the opening drive of the third quarter, setting up San Francisco at the Kansas City 44-yard line.\n\nIt was a bad start after a poor handoff to Isiah Pacheco resulted in a fumble for a loss of 12. Two plays later, Mahomes was picked off, which was his first interception thrown in the past two postseasons. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nLAS VEGAS — Super Bowl 58 might have started unlucky because neither team scored in the first quarter and each team committed a turnover.\n\nBut when the Kansas City Chiefs scored a field goal late in the second quarter, making them trail the San Francisco 49ers 10-3, conspiracy theories surrounding Taylor Swift and her lucky No. 13 seemed all too real. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLAS VEGAS – Word spread through the 200 club level on the east side of Allegiant Stadium as kickoff for Super Bowl 58 neared. More than two-dozen people congregated along a corridor and in the area near Suite E2020, which they’d heard had an exclusive guest.\n\nTaylor Swift.\n\nThe clock ticked. No Taylor. The crowd dispersed, but those who snuck past security to get to the front side of the suite confirmed the rumors. — Josh Peter\n\nWinners and losers of Super Bowl 58 second quarter: 49ers 10, Chiefs 3\n\nWINNERS\n\nTrick play, perfectly timed\n\nCredit 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan for the timing of the double pass touchdown to Christian McCaffrey — via the arm of receiver Jauan Jennings — to compromise Kansas City’s defense. With San Francisco just outside of the red zone, Shanahan must’ve known that Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo would be particularly aggressive. When Brock Purdy threw the first pass to Jennings, almost all of Kansas City’s defense rushed to the left side of the field, leaving McCaffrey and a roster of blockers — four of them — to easily pave a lane for McCaffrey to run unimpeded into the end zone.\n\nLOSERS\n\nIsiah Pacheco\n\nThe Chiefs running back absolutely wasted a chance at getting points when the ball squirted out of his hands on a first-and-goal carry from the 9, the play immediately following Patrick Mahomes’ 52-yard strike to Mecole Hardman. The 49ers recovered, meaning both teams have given the ball away deep in opposing territory. Pacheco, otherwise, has been a nonfactor, carrying the ball seven times for 27 yards in the first half.\n\nAwful injury luck for the Niners\n\n49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw is something of a tone-setting enforcer for the San Francisco defense. He had already recorded three tackles in the game before his freak Achilles injury, when he crumpled to the turf simply trying to run on the field for the game’s next play. Greenlaw, who has been ruled out, is a massive loss for San Francisco’s defense, leaving a void of speed and physicality needed to defend against the Chiefs.\n\nKansas City (uncharacteristically) losing its composure\n\nIn the second quarter alone, the Chiefs saw star tight end Travis Kelce bump head coach Andy Reid because he was apparently upset over not being on the field when Pacheco fumbled and star cornerback L’Jarius Sneed called for an unnecessary roughness penalty. Two plays after Sneed's penalty, San Francisco scored the game’s first touchdown. The Chiefs appeared to settle — defensive tackle Chris Jones called a huddle on the sideline to have a meeting of the entire defense — but this is rather uncharted territory for the more experienced team on this stage. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 halftime score is 13! Are Taylor Swift conspiracy theories real?\n\nLAS VEGAS — Super Bowl 58 might have started unlucky because neither team scored in the first quarter and each team committed a turnover.\n\nBut when the Kansas City Chiefs scored a field goal late in the second quarter, making them trail the San Francisco 49ers 10-3, conspiracy theories surrounding Taylor Swift and her lucky No. 13 seemed all too real.\n\nThe pop superstar, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, made it to Allegiant Stadium after flying her private jet 13 hours to Los Angeles from Tokyo and then flying into Las Vegas for the game. The Super Bowl is the 13th Chiefs game she has attended this season to cheer on her man. The numbers of 5 and 8 in the Super Bowl edition, the date — Feb. 11 (2+11) — and the 49ers digits all add up to 13. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBiggest comebacks in Super Bowl history\n\n25 points — Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl 51\n\n10 points — Chiefs against 49ers in Super Bowl 54\n\n10 points — Patriots against Seahawks in Super Bowl 49\n\n10 points — Saints against Colts in Super Bowl 44\n\n10 points — Washington against Broncos in Super Bowl 22\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers halftime stats\n\n49ers passing — Brock Purdy 10-15 for 123 yards; Jauan Jennings 1-1 for 21 yards, TD\n\n49ers rushing — Christian McCaffrey 9 carries, 33 yards\n\n49ers receiving — Christian McCaffrey 5 receptions, 47 yards, TD; Deebo Samuel 2 catches, 24 yards\n\n49ers defense — Fred Warner 6 tackles, Arik Armstead 1 sack, Chase Young 1 sack\n\nChiefs passing — Patrick Mahomes 11-13 for 123 yards\n\nChiefs rushing — Isiah Pacheco 7 carries, 27 yards\n\nChiefs receiving — Mecole Hardman 1 catch, 52 yards; Justin Watson 1 catch, 21 yards\n\nChiefs defense — Nick Bolton 8 tackles, Justin Reid 0.5 sacks, George Karlaftis 0.5 sacks\n\nTravis Kelce stats at halftime\n\nChiefs star tight end Travis Kelce has just one catch for 1 yard as Super Bowl 58 rolls into halftime.\n\nKelce had shined this postseason, making 23 catches for 262 yards and three touchdowns in the Chiefs' three victories. Kelce's 157 playoff catches (including today) are a record and he's never had fewer than three in a playoff game.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis had the foresight to include this in his bold predictions. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 10, Chiefs 3: KC finally gets on board in Super Bowl 58\n\nAfter falling down two possessions, the Chiefs were able to score just before halftime with a field goal to make it a 10-3 49ers lead.\n\nIt was the longest drive of the day for Kansas City at 12 plays, 65 yards. It was just its second red zone trip of the evening. The Chiefs were able to get to the 9-yard line on third down, but Patrick Mahomes took a big hit from Arik Armstead that resulted in a 1-yard sack. Harrison Butker, who kicked the game-winning field goal in last season’s Super Bowl, then knocked in the 28-yard field goal for Kansas City’s first points.\n\nWhile still trailing, Kansas City will have a chance to tie it up out of the break, as it will get the ball to start the second half. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl score: Beautiful trick play gives 49ers 10-0 lead\n\nThe play was slow developing and a little awkward, but it worked. It may end up being the play of the game.\n\n49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings threw a pass to Christian McCaffrey that hung in the air so long it could have been shot down by the Air Force. But it connected and McCaffrey ran in for the touchdown. It was his ninth career postseason touchdown.\n\nSo in the end, the first player to throw a touchdown pass was a wide receiver. — Mike Freeman\n\nDre Greenlaw injury\n\nA non-contact injury has put San Francisco 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw out of Super Bowl 58.\n\nAfter the 49ers punted the ball to the Kansas City Chiefs in the second quarter at Allegiant Stadium, Greenlaw was getting himself hyped to back on the field with the rest of the defense. But when he took a step toward the field, there appeared to be an issue with his left leg and he immediately went to the ground. Trainers came to his aide as he was unable to put any pressure on his leg and he made his way to the bench.\n\nGreenlaw has an Achilles injury and has been ruled out. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl field\n\nThough Allegiant Stadium is domed, the playing surface is natural grass.\n\nNFL's turf vs. grass debate rages on. Here’s what the overwhelming majority of players think\n\nAs NFL Players' Association executive director Lloyd Howell toured the 32 organizations in the league throughout the 2023 regular season, he listened to players' concerns over a wide variety of issues. For a union with a membership around 2,000 individuals, finding a consensus to address any one issue can be a problem. Howell quickly realized which one had the most unanimity: players' desires to play on grass fields instead of turf.\n\nThe topic — already relevant ahead of Super Bowl 58 as the San Francisco 49ers voiced concerns ahead of their matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs — was the primary theme of Howell's first public appearance as leader of the union since he was named to the position over the summer.\n\nA survey conducted by the NFLPA that included 1,700 respondents had a 92% response rate of players saying they preferred to play on high-quality grass rather than synthetic turf. Six percent are indifferent, according to the survey. Read Chris Bumbaca’s full story here.\n\nChiefs drive: KC goes three and out\n\nKansas City's offense continues to struggle against San Francisco's D.\n\nMahomes was called for intentional grounding on the first play and then was nearly sacked on third-and-16 but managed to scramble for a few yards. Tommy Townsend came on for his third punt of the game, and the 49ers will start at their own 33. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers can't take advantage of horse collar penalty\n\nWhile scrambling, Brock Purdy was grabbed by Kansas City linebacker Nick Bolton. It was called a horse collar tackle. It was a questionable one. But it gave San Francisco a first down. But again, the 49ers still couldn’t consistently move the ball. The game remained an unattractive slugfest of an unattractive game of slugfest proportions. — Mike Freeman\n\nTravis Kelce yelling at coach: Chiefs TE gets heated on sideline\n\nTravis Kelce was heated on the Kansas City Chiefs’ sideline following Isiah Pacheco's red zone fumble.\n\nKelce was shown on the CBS broadcast screaming at coach Andy Reid, even bumping into the 65-year-old coach. CBS analyst Tony Romo speculated that Kelce was aggressively saying he should have stayed on the field with the Chiefs on the verge of the end zone (he was not on the field when Pacheco fumbled). — Jace Evans\n\n49ers recover Chiefs fumble\n\nJust when it looked like the Chiefs could get even, they gave the ball away.\n\nOne play after Patrick Mahomes connected with Mecole Hardman on a 52-yard play down to the 49ers' 9-yard line, Kansas City running back Isiah Pacheco lost the football. Javon Hargrave recovered the fumble and gave possession back to San Francisco. — Casey Moore\n\nLongest field goal in Super Bowl history: Jake Moody gives 49ers lead\n\nThe game has been mostly a punter’s dream but again Brock Purdy, showing calmness and accuracy, connected on several crucial long passes, moving the 49ers into Kansas City territory.\n\nKey part of this game has been mostly San Francisco’s ability to protect Purdy.\n\nThe 49ers’ drive ended with Jake Moody's Super Bowl record 55-yard field goal. Suddenly, punters everywhere wept. — Mike Freeman\n\nWho is Jake Moody? Meet 49ers' record-breaking kicker\n\nJake Moody, 24, is a rookie who was drafted with the 99th overall selection in the third round of the 2023 NFL draft. Here's what else you need to know about him.\n\nWinners and losers of Super Bowl 58 first quarter: Chiefs 0, 49ers 0\n\nWinners\n\n49ers dominating the lines of scrimmage\n\nSan Francisco completely controlled the first quarter, outgaining the Chiefs, 125-16. It all happened upfront, on both the offensive and defensive lines. Brock Purdy had ample time to drop back and survey the field, running through his progressions with ease. On defense, the 49ers generated enough pressure to fold Mahomes back into the pocket and quicken his timing. The Chiefs ran only seven offensive plays in the first frame and their opening possession was a three-and-out. The problem for the 49ers: because of Christian McCaffrey’s fumble and Trent Williams’ penalties, they haven’t take advantage — at least not yet.\n\nKansas City's decision to defer\n\nBrock Purdy and the 49ers, thanks mainly to Christian McCaffrey’s four touches on the first five plays of the game, were charging down the field, gaining 48 yards. McCaffrey’s fumble, however, cut the first drive of the game short and gave Kansas City a chance to take an early lead. San Francisco’s defense held and Kansas City posted a three-and-out, but the decision to defer can still pay dividends if the Chiefs manage the clock in the second quarter to be the last team to score, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nMitch Wishnowsky and Tommy Townsend\n\nIt’s typically not a great sign if both punters are on this side of the list, but San Francisco’s Mitch Wishnowsky had a field-reversing, 54-yard punt after penalties stalled the second Niners’ drive. Then, on the following series, Chiefs punter Tommy Townsend flipped the field and answered with his 62-yard bomb. Both punts buried the opposing offenses deep in their own 20.\n\nLosers\n\nChristian McCaffrey and Trent Williams\n\nWithout question, these two are among San Francisco’s best players. McCaffrey is fresh off of his AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Williams just posted his third consecutive first team All-Pro season. Both of them cost the 49ers in the first quarter. McCaffrey’s fumble robbed San Francisco’s chance to seize momentum and two Williams penalties on the second series stalled the drive. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhen was Christian McCaffrey drafted\n\nMcCaffrey was selected by the Carolina Panthers with the No. 8 overall pick out of Stanford in the 2017 NFL draft. He was the second running back taken in the first round, behind Leonard Fournette, who was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the No. 4 pick. — Casey Moore\n\nWhere did George Kittle go to college\n\nKittle went to Iowa, where he only caught six passes for 134 yards his first two seasons before notching 42 receptions for 604 yards and 10 touchdowns during his final two years. He was drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL draft. — Casey Moore\n\nWhere did Deebo Samuel go to college\n\nSamuel attended South Carolina, where he put together two seasons with more than 750 receiving yards, including his senior year when he caught 62 passes for 882 yards and 11 touchdowns. He was drafted by the 49ers in the second round of the 2019 NFL draft. — Casey Moore\n\nTaylor Swift, celebrities at Super Bowl 2024\n\nIn addition to Taylor Swift, celebrities at the Super Bowl include: Paul Rudd, Queen Latifah, Jay Z, Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, Eric Stonestreet, Jimmy Kimmel, Carrot Top, Wayne Newton and the Blue Man Group.\n\nHow much do concessions cost at Super Bowl 2024?\n\nConcession prices were slightly higher than at Super Bowl 55 in Los Angeles with a soda costing between $6.99 and $8.99 at Allegiant versus $7 at SoFi Stadium.\n\nOne of the specialty foods available at Super Bowl 58 is a $37.99 order of beef ribs from local family chain Rollin Smoke Barbeque. There's also tacos and the usual popcorn, pretzels and beer.\n\nHere's the full concession rundown on the concession situation, from Victoria Hernandez on the scene in Las Vegas\n\n49ers force Chiefs to punt again\n\nKansas City was able to get a first down, but didn't get much more after that, punting the ball back to the 49ers for the second time in as many drives.\n\nAfter Isiah Pachecho picked up 10 yards for a first down on the first play of the second drive, Chase Young was able to get to Patrick Mahomes for a 4-yard sack. Mahomes found Rashee Rice on the next play, but for no gain. The pressure got close to Mahomes on third down, and he was forced to scramble for a minimum gain.\n\nSo far, Kansas City has 16 yards on seven plays. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCrucial penalties doom 49ers' second drive\n\nPerhaps still being impacted by Reba McEntire’s low energy anthem performance, the 49ers continued to struggle on offense. This time penalties forced the offense into long yardage situations and Kansas City’s defense was all too happy to take advantage and stop San Francisco. — Mike Freeman\n\nChiefs offense goes three-and-out on first drive\n\nKansas City was able to force a major turnover in its own territory, but it wasn't able to do anything with it as it punted the ball back to the 49ers after failing to get a first down in three plays.\n\nThe Chiefs got the ball on their own 27-yard line after recovering a Christian McCaffrey fumble, but a 3-yard loss by Isiah Pacheco on the first play set the Chiefs back quickly. Travis Kelce got his first catch on the next play for only 1 yard, and on third down Jerick McKinnon wasn’t able to reach the first down line on a catch.\n\nThe punt ended the Chiefs' eight-game streak of scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCBS scorebug\n\nYour eyes aren't deceiving you, it is (a little) different!\n\nChristian McCaffrey fumbles, halts 49ers' opening drive\n\nThe initial drive of the San Francisco 49ers started off smoothly. If quarterback Brock Purdy was nervous it didn’t show as coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up easy passes and handoffs to running back Christian McCaffrey. Then disaster struck as McCaffrey fumbled and Kansas City recovered. It was just the third fumble lost by McCaffrey all year, and first since the 49ers' Week 7 loss against the Minnesota Vikings, a span of 12 games. — Mike Freeman and Casey Moore\n\nWho won the coin toss?\n\nAs the visiting team, the 49ers got to make the call on the coin toss, which was tails. The coin landed on heads, and the Chiefs deferred to the second half. San Francisco will start with the ball. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHow long was the national anthem before Super Bowl?

The Chiefs' offense ranked ninth in total yards per game (351.3) and 15th in scoring (21.8 points per game). On defense, they were second in total yards per game (289.8) and second in scoring (17.3).

The 19-year NFL referee will wear the white hat for Super Bowl 58. Here’s the officiating crew Vinovich will lead: Umpire Terry Killens, down judge Patrick Holt, line judge Mark Perlman, field judge Tom Hill, side judge Allen Baynes, back judge Brad Freeman and replay official Mike Chase. This is the third Super Bowl assignment for Vinovich. He reffed Super Bowl 49 between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks and Super Bowl 54 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers. Vinovich was the alternate for Super Bowl 56. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nWho is Bill Vinovich?\n\nBill Vinovich, 62, is a third-generation referee who worked his way up to officiating college football in the Mountain West Conference. He started as a side judge for the NFL in 2001 and was promoted to an official prior to the 2004 season. For health reasons, Vinovich stopped refereeing on the field from 2007-2011 and served as a replay official. He returned to the field following successful heart surgery in 2012 on a substitute basis. Vinovich is also a certified public accountant and officiates Division I college basketball games. In his youth, Vinovich was a three-sport star at Canyon High School in Anaheim, California. He played wide receiver for two years at Santa Ana College and two years at the University of San Diego, where he graduated magna cum laude. Vinovich was also the referee in the controversial 2018 NFC championship game.

The stadium is the home venue of the Las Vegas Raiders, who moved to the city in 2020. In fact, this will mark the first time in NFL history that a Super Bowl will be played in the state of Nevada. Las Vegas becomes the 19th different host city and Allegiant Stadium becomes the 27th different venue to host a Super Bowl. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 jersey colors\n\nGet the uniforms ready: we know what the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will wear in Super Bowl 58.

The decision has been made, and the Chiefs will wear their home red uniform for the game. Meanwhile, the 49ers will don their traditional road white uniform. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl 58 predictions\n\nHere are our NFL expert picks based on the early odds for Super Bowl 58:\n\nJarrett Bell: Chiefs 27, 49ers 24\n\nChiefs 27, 49ers 24 Chris Bumbaca: Chiefs 30, 49ers 25\n\nChiefs 30, 49ers 25 Nate Davis: Chiefs 23, 49ers 20\n\nChiefs 23, 49ers 20 Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz: Chiefs 21, 49ers 16\n\nChiefs 21, 49ers 16 Lorenzo Reyes: 49ers 24, Chiefs 19\n\n49ers 24, Chiefs 19 Tyler Dragon: Chiefs 23, 49ers 20\n\nChiefs 23, 49ers 20 Safid Deen: Chiefs 30, 49ers 26\n\nChiefs 30, 49ers 26 Victoria Hernandez: Chiefs 28, 49ers 24\n\nChiefs 28, 49ers 24 Jordan Mendoza: Chiefs 20, 49ers 17\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers moneyline\n\nThe most basic of all bets is called the moneyline. It's simply, which team will win the game? There's a different payout for betting on each team, with the return for a wager on the favorite totaling less than the same wager on the underdog. In Super Bowl 58, the 49ers are the favorite at -130 odds. The Chiefs are the underdog at +110. Betting the moneyline:\n\nThe negative odds (-130) mean that a person would have to wager $130 on the Niners in order to win $100.\n\nThe positive odds (+110) mean that a person who successfully wagers $100 on the Chiefs would win $110. — Steve Gardner\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers point spread\n\nIn Super Bowl 58, the 49ers are a 2-point favorite over the Chiefs. To win a bet on the 49ers against the spread, they have to win by three or more points. To win a bet on the Chiefs against the spread, they need to win the game outright or lose by one or two points. The point spread is the number of points one team is favored over the other.\n\nWhen bettors wager against the spread, the final score of the game matters more than which team won. The favored team needs to win by more than the point spread in order to \"cover\" and win the bet. The underdog can still lose the game if it does so by less than the point spread for its bettors to win. — Steve Gardner\n\nSuper Bowl 58 logo\n\nSince Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the NFL's updated its graphics for the title game each season. It's even inspired a conspiracy theory about the matchup for the championship game. It's not the first change from the past 58 years, though, just the most recent. Here's a look at the history of Super Bowl logos. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nLVIII number\n\nWhat is Super Bowl LVIII? Want to learn how to read Roman numerals and why the NFL uses them? Here’s your guide.\n\nWho won Super Bowl 57?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57, the team’s second title in four seasons. A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nPatrick Mahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns. Kansas City scored a touchdown on its first three drives of the second half after trailing at halftime 24-14. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was 27 of 37 for 304 yards passing, but was also a force on the ground. He rushed for three touchdowns (15 carries, 70 yards) and tied the game at 35 on a two-point conversion with about five minutes left. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (six catches, 81 yards, touchdown) bested his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, on the game’s biggest stage, while Chiefs coach Andy Reid defeated his former team.\n\nHere’s the complete recap of Super Bowl 57.\n\nSuper Bowl 58 squares: How to play, best (and worst) squares for the big game\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday doesn't have to only be a fun experience for football and commercial lovers. It's also an opportunity to turn the casual fan into a competitive one, and there might not be a better game for your party than Super Bowl squares. You don't have to know anything about the game of football to play squares, which levels the playing field for a room mixed with diehards and nonfans. And there are a variety of ways to play that gets everyone involved. New to the game? USA TODAY Sports has you covered with everything you need to know to play Super Bowl squares, including which squares are most likely to win.\n\nTaylor Swift's plane has landed in Las Vegas, NFL Network reports\n\nOne of the most important pregame questions for Super Bowl 58 has apparently been answered. \"Taylor Swift is in Las Vegas,\" NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said from the field at Allegiant Stadium. The pop superstar's trans-Pacific flight following her Saturday night concert in Tokyo landed in Los Angeles earlier today, and Rapoport said the connecting flight to Vegas just recently touched down.\n\n\"I'll never report bigger news today,\" Rapoport quipped.All that's left is for Swift to find her way to Allegiant Stadium, where she'll take her familiar spot in a luxury box to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Chiefs. - Steve Gardner\n\nTravis Kelce vs 49ers\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce has faced the 49ers three times in his career, Kansas City holding a 2-1 edge. In those matchups, Kelce has caught 16 passes on 21 targets for 227 yards and a touchdown. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nBrock Purdy vs Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe two Super Bowl quarterbacks have faced off once before in the NFL — kind of. When the Chiefs and 49ers played in October 2022, a contest Kansas City won 44-23, Jimmy Garoppolo was under center for San Francisco. After Garoppolo was yanked late in the fourth quarter, Purdy got some garbage time reps, completing 4 of 9 passes for 66 yards and an interception. Mahomes, meanwhile, went 23-of-34 for 423 yards, three TDs and a pick. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nHow much money can Chiefs and 49ers players earn if they win Super Bowl 58?\n\nFor players on the Super Bowl 58 winning team, $164,000 of prize money can be earned. Players on the losing team will get $89,000 in prize money. Both totals represent a $7,000 increase from the per-player payouts from Super Bowl 57. Teams also earn prize money as they advance through the playoffs. As a division winner that also played on wild-card weekend, the Chiefs can earn the maximum $338,000 if they win the Super Bowl. The 49ers, meanwhile, who didn't play on wild-card weekend due to being the NFC's No. 1 playoff seed, can earn a maximum of $333,000 if they win on Super Sunday. — Jim Reineking\n\nWho is the highest-paid player in Super Bowl 58?\n\nThat title of the highest-paid player in Super Bowl 58 belongs to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In September, Mahomes agreed to a restructured contract with the Chiefs that will pay him $210.6 million guaranteed between 2023 and 2026, the most ever for an NFL player in a four-year span, according to ESPN. Mahomes is under contract until 2031, but he and the Chiefs will revisit his contract after the 2026 season. — Cydney Henderson\n\nHighest-paid players in Super Bowl 58\n\nHere are the highest-paid players in Super Bowl 58 based on average annual value, according to Over The Cap. — Cydney Henderson\n\nThe 58 greatest players in Super Bowl history: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut\n\nCrafting a list of the greatest players in Super Bowl history is a near-impossible endeavor. Do you favor the biggest stars? Those who shone brightest on Super Sunday? The ones with sustained levels of excellence? Nate Davis weighed each consideration, attempting to also make it representative of all positions rather than skew too heavily toward quarterbacks or offensive players who more easily show up in the box score (and MVP log). So, here's his list of the 58 greatest players in Super Bowl history as we head into Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWhat is the capacity of Allegiant Stadium?\n\nFor regular-season Raiders games, capacity of Allegiant Stadium is 65,000, though many venues that host Super Bowls typically can add seating for a game of that magnitude. That makes Allegiant Stadium the fourth-smallest stadium in the NFL with Ford Field (65,000), State Farm Stadium (63,400) and Solider Field (61,500). — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 stadium: Where exactly is Allegiant Stadium?\n\nAllegiant Stadium is just west of the southern edge of Las Vegas Boulevard, more famously known as the Las Vegas Strip. That makes Allegiant Stadium quite accessible for guests staying at some of Las Vegas’ more popular hotels and resorts on the Strip. For ease of transportation, the stadium is also very close to Harry Reid International Airport, the city’s main hub, about a 15-minute drive away. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n'Game manager' means double standard for Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes\n\nFor the San Francisco 49ers, \"game manager\" might be the two most vexing words of Super Bowl week. But it’s a label that’s been attached to quarterback Brock Purdy with what seems like a certain level of disparagement. Conversely, Kansas City Chiefs counterpart and two-time league MVP Patrick Mahomes has been praised lately for his prowess as, yup, a \"game manager.\"\n\nSo what gives? Why the shade aimed at a guy – meaning Purdy – who was an MVP finalist for the 2023 season, compounded by a double standard?\n\n\"I don’t have the strongest arm in the world, or I may not be making crazy, flashy plays like other guys around the league,\" said Purdy. \"At the end of the day, if we’re looking at the main goal, it’s about winning – and, so, I feel like I can do that well.\" - Nate Davis\n\nThe 58 greatest NFL teams to play in the Super Bowl – and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nThe 2023 Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will become the 115th and 116th Super Bowl participants on Sunday, when they cross paths at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Through the years, there have been several dominant squads, some which caught lightning in a bottle at just the right time and others seemingly poised for greatness that ultimately fell just short in the NFL's biggest game. Here are what Nate Davis believes to be the 58 greatest teams to play on Super Bowl Sunday – and not all of them won.\n\nRun it back. Super Bowl 58 will mark the ninth “rematch” between franchises that have previously collided on Super Sunday (the Cowboys and Steelers the only clubs to meet three times). It was only four years ago that the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers battled in South Florida, K.C. ending a 50-year Super Bowl drought by prevailing 31-20 in a game that was far closer and dramatic than the final score indicates. As Super Bowl 58, which will be the first ever staged in Las Vegas, approaches, here are Nate Davis’ all-time Super Sunday game rankings.\n\nSuper Bowl 58 bold predictions for Chiefs vs. 49ers\n\nWhat predictions are there left to make for Super Bowl 58?\n\nAfter two weeks of anticipation and preparation, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers have been closely inspected and analyzed from an array of angles. Picks have been made for Sunday's big event in Las Vegas. Prop bets have been outlined.\n\nBut with kickoff drawing near, we couldn't help but take one last crack at forecasting what might be ahead at Allegiant Stadium to close out the 2023 NFL season. With that in mind, we asked USA TODAY Sports' NFL reporters and columnists for one bold prediction for Super Bowl 58. Here are the results.\n\n49ers’ Super Bowl appearances\n\nSuper Bowl 58 will be San Francisco's eighth Super Bowl. The other seven are: Super Bowl 16, Super Bowl 19, Super Bowl 23, Super Bowl 24, Super Bowl 29, Super Bowl 47 and Super Bowl 54. San Francisco has won five Super Bowl championships. After winning in the big game their first five trips, the 49ers have lost the last two times they've been to the Super Bowl. San Francisco last hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after the 1994 season in Super Bowl 29 against the then-San Diego Chargers. Here’s everything to know about the 49ers’ Super Bowl history. — Tyler Dragon\n\nHow many Super Bowls have the Chiefs won?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are playing in their sixth Super Bowl and making their fourth appearance in the past five years. Kansas City has won eight consecutive AFC West crowns, the second-longest streak of division championships for any NFL team since 1970. The Chiefs are also vying for their fourth Super Bowl title. The New York Giants (4), Green Bay Packers (4), Dallas Cowboys (5), San Francisco 49ers (5), Pittsburgh Steelers (6) and New England Patriots (6) are the only teams with four or more Super Bowl wins. Here's everything to know about the Chiefs' Super Bowl history. — Tyler Dragon\n\nHow much are Super Bowl tickets?\n\nIt's the most expensive Super Bowl on record, according to TickPick, with average ticket prices around $9,384 on the secondary market. For reference, Super Bowl 57's average ticket price was $5,795, TickPick said. Even if you want to pay the minimum for a Super Bowl ticket on a secondary market, it will still cost close to five figures.\n\nThe cheapest ticket to the game can be found on StubHub for $5,542, $7,481 with fees, as of Thursday afternoon. The cheapest tickets for Allegiant Stadium will be further away from the action, like the 300 sections on the endzone sides and the corners of the 400 level. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nEven for Las Vegas, Super Bowl 58 is a huge deal\n\nThousands of fans descended upon the bottom of The Strip the day before \"the Big Game.\" Said 10-year Vegas resident Dominick Lynch, a host at Wahlburgers in \"The Shoppes at Mandalay Bay\" mall: \"I’ve never really seen it this busy. We’ve always had a rush-in with the conventions and stuff, but it’s never been quite like this. You can just feel it walking around. It’s great.\" Read Chris Bumbaca's story here.\n\nBody piercer finds jewelry connected to 'Nipplegate' Super Bowl scandal\n\nByriah Dailey, a body piercer from Houston, said he was cleaning in his garage recently when he rediscovered a piece of Super Bowl history. It was the coordinating nipple shield that matches the one worn by Janet Jackson during the halftime show at the 2004 Super Bowl, Dailey said. Since that infamous moment, he has been credited with selling the piece of jewelry to Jackson’s former fashion stylist, Wayne Scot Lukas, days before the game. “It was a little tarnished because it’s been sitting in a drawer for awhile,\" Dailey, 53, told USA TODAY Sports. Read Josh Peter's story here.\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers Super Bowl 2019\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid all won their first Super Bowl four years ago, a 31-20 victory over Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. Jimmy Garoppolo started at quarterback for San Francisco, completing 20 of 31 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown and two picks. Mahomes was 26-of-42 passing for 286 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nHere’s the complete list of Super Bowl scores, MVPs and locations for all 57 previous games. — Jim Reineking\n\nChiefs vs 49ers past games\n\nThe Chiefs and 49ers have played each other 14 times, each side winning seven of those contests. All but one of those matchups were in the regular season. The lone playoff matchup was in Super Bowl 54, which Kansas City won. The sides most recently played in 2022, Kansas City winning 44-23. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nWhat happened to Kadarius Toney?\n\nKansas City Chiefs wide receiver Kadarius Toney is not expected to play in Super Bowl 58, according to an ESPN report. The controversial wide receiver, who caught a touchdown pass and had a key 65-yard punt return in the Chiefs' Super Bowl win last year, hasn't been active since Week 15 of the regular season. Toney made headlines when he denied being injured and blasted the Chiefs on social media before the AFC championship game. When asked about Toney's status for Super Bowl Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers earlier in the week, Chiefs coach Andy Reid would only say, \"We'll see how it goes.\" — Steve Gardner\n\nNational anthem length betting lines\n\nThis year, the betting line ranges from 86 to 90.5 seconds. The “over” is favored for good reason considering the average anthem performance is one minute and 5 seconds. — Melissa Ruggieri\n\nUsher’s biggest hits: What songs will he perform at the Super Bowl?\n\nIf you made an Usher playlist using only his biggest hits it would last an hour and 42 minutes, according to the one we built on Apple Music. The Super Bowl halftime show is slotted for 12-15 minutes. Prepare for many medleys. There are many Usher songs we hope to hear, even if they’re a medley. Here they are, presented by era. — Melissa Ruggieri\n\nHow long is the Super Bowl Halftime Show?\n\nA regular NFL halftime normally lasts 13 minutes, but halftime for the Super Bowl lasts longer to accommodate for the setup, show and takedown, in addition to teams' on-field warm-ups. Still, expect Usher to be on the stage for fewer than 15 minutes. \"Don’t take the moments for granted because you only get 13 of them,\" Usher said of the halftime show in November. \"The hardest part is trying to figure out how to squeeze it all in when you actually have a large catalog, or a lot of records people celebrate and love.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nWhen is Super Bowl halftime show? Here's when you should expect to tune in to watch Usher\n\nUsher's halftime show performance will take place during, well, halftime, but when exactly is that? Halftime is a brief intermission between the first and second halves of the Super Bowl. Each half of the game is made up of two 15-minute quarters, but the game clock differs from the actual length of the game. Stoppages in play, from timeouts to TV timeouts and commercials during the game, make it hard to predict the exact time halftime begins, but on average, each quarter typically lasts about 45 minutes. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. — Cydney Henderson\n\nWill Taylor Swift be at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough it has yet to be confirmed whether Taylor Swift will be at the Super Bowl, it seems unlikely she would miss the biggest game of the season. Swift has been to 12 Chiefs games this season, including each of Kansas City's playoff games. Swift's concert in Tokyo — which is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas — is set for 6 p.m. local time Saturday, with her concerts typically lasting more than 3 hours, 15 minutes. According to NPR, Swift's show at the Tokyo Dome is located roughly 30 minutes from Haneda and an hour from Narita, Tokyo's main two airports. Kevin O'Leary, the president and CEO of Jet Advisors, told NPR that Swift could be in the air around 11:30 p.m. in Japan, or 6:30 a.m. Las Vegas time, after meeting some \"logistics and clearances\" before liftoff. — Austin Curtright\n\n——\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Labor Day was originally designed to honor workers as part of the American organized labor movement.\n\nWhen Labor Day started\n\nLabor Day was first celebrated unofficially by labor activists and individual states in the late 1800s, according to the US Department of Labor. New York was the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to actually codify it into law in 1887. Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had followed suit by the end of 1887.\n\nJoshua Freeman, a labor historian and professor emeritus at the City University of New York, tells CNN that the holiday developed as unions were beginning to strengthen again after the 1870s recession.\n\nIn New York City, two events converged that contributed to the formation of Labor Day, Freeman says. First, the now-defunct Central Labor Union was formed as a “umbrella body” for unions across trades and ethnic groups. Additionally, the Knights of Labor, then the largest national labor convention, held a convention in the city, complete with a large parade. But the parade fell on a Tuesday at the start of September – and many workers were unable to attend.\n\nThe convention was a huge success, and unions around the country started holding their own labor celebrations at the start of September, usually on the first Monday of the month.\n\nAt the beginning, “it was a somewhat daring move to participate, because you could get yourself fired,” Freedman said. But over time, states began to recognize the holiday, and it became more common for employers to give their employees the day off.\n\nIt wasn’t until June 28, 1894 that Congress passed an act naming the first day of September a legal holiday called Labor Day.\n\nFreeman says that earlier that year, President Grover Cleveland sent in the military to squash the Pullman railway strike. Cleveland pushed through legislation to recognize Labor Day just days after the strike ended, in a “gesture towards organized labor,” Freeman said.\n\nA marching band at the Labor Day Parade in Silverton, Colorado, in September 1940. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWhat Labor Day means\n\nAt the time Labor Day was formed, unions were fighting for “very specific improvements in their working conditions,” Freeman said. Workers were fighting hard for the eight-hour work day most workers enjoy today. And Labor Day was an opportunity for them to come together to discuss their priorities – and for the country to acknowledge the contributions workers make to society.\n\nBut there was also a more radical political thread to the Labor Day celebration, Freeman says. The Knights of Labor were exploring the idea that “what we call the capitalist or industrial system was fundamentally exploitative,” he said. “It introduced kind of inequities and inequalities, not just in wealth, but also in power. So they wanted a greater say in society for working people.”\n\n“Back when Labor Day began, there were a lot of voices that were fundamentally challenging this emerging system,” Freeman added. Labor leaders at the time advocated for alternatives to the “capitalist wage system,” like collective ownership of corporations or socialism.\n\nTravelers queue up at the south security checkpoint in Denver International Airport as the Labor Day holiday approaches,on Tuesday, August. 30, 2022. David Zalubowski/AP\n\nThe evolution of Labor Day\n\nOver time, the radical politics around Labor Day became tempered. Around the world, most countries honor workers with a holiday called May Day, celebrated on May 1, which also has its origins in the late 19th century and the fight for the eight-hour work day. For a long time, Freeman says, Americans celebrated both May Day and Labor Day.\n\nBut eventually, Labor Day began to be seen as the more “moderate” of the two holidays, in comparison to May Day, which was originally established by the Marxist International Socialist Congress.\n\n“By the turn of the 20th century, calls for transforming American life, they pretty much disappear from Labor Day,” Freeman said. “As more and more employers began to give all their workers the day off, it became less associated specifically with unions.”\n\nAfter World War II, Labor Day celebrations had a brief revival, especially in cities like Detroit and New York City. But by the 60s and 70s, they had tapered off again.\n\n“I think most people just think of as the end of summer holiday,” Freeman said. “It’s not really associated with its origins that much.”\n\nCan you wear white after Labor Day?\n\nYou might have heard the outdated rule that you shouldn’t wear white after Labor Day.\n\nBut don’t worry: There’s no fashion police out there waiting to see if you don a white shirt in September. And the idea actually has a pretty problematic origin.\n\nThe rule was one of many 19th century style customs used to distinguish the upper and middle classes, according to Valerie Steele, a fashion historian and director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\n“As you got more and more sort of ordinary people, whether middle class or lower middle class, being able to have enough money to try to dress fashionably, then there become more rules so that the more upper class people can say ‘yes, but you’re doing it wrong,’” Steele told CNN.\n\nWhite was tied to summer vacations – a privilege only few could afford. Labor Day represented the “reentry” into city life and the retirement of white summer clothes after a summer of leisure for the upper classes, Steele says.\n\nBut the arbitrary rule all but disappeared during the 1970s, Steele says. The 1960s “Youthquake” allowed young people to challenge old stylistic norms, including the Labor Day rule.\n\n“It was part of a much wider anti-fashion movement,” said Steele.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/03/field-days-preview/71643588/", "title": "End-of-summer party at Johnson City Field Days", "text": "Katie Sullivan\n\nksullivan@pressconnects.com | @ByKatieSullivan\n\nWith the unofficial end of summer upon us, the Johnson City Field Days stand as a reminder that there is still fun to be had.\n\nIn its 48th year, the annual event — hosted by the Johnson City Celebration Committee — will be held at Northside Park on Harry L Drive, beginning Friday and continuing through Monday. Several thousand people are expected to attend the festival, aided by four days of sunshine forecast for the holiday weekend.\n\nJohnson City Field Days Co-Chairwoman Diane Salva said the purpose of the event is to raise money for local non-profit organizations — many for which the field days are the only fundraiser of the year — with each organization setting up a food or game booth in the park. The profits from those booths go directly to support the organization’s respective cause.\n\n“When you’re playing a game or you’re buying food, you’re supporting that organization,” Salva said.\n\nAdmission to the four-day event is free. Rides are $2 each, or 10 rides for $15 over the weekend. During a special Kids Day event from 1 to 4 p.m. on Saturday, the cost for four rides will be $5.\n\nHeld to coincide with Labor Day weekend each year, Salva said the part of the draw of the Field Days is its tradition.\n\n“We’re usually the last event of the summer before school starts,” she said. “For a lot of people, it’s that end-of-summer party.”\n\nNew to the party are several entertainment acts, performing on stage throughout the weekend. A packed line-up of musical entertainment includes Rooster and the Roadhouse Horns, Outer Reef, Reprise 60s, The Scott Freeman Band and the Revival Horns, Tony’s Polka Band, Barefoot Betty’s Acoustic Band, Miles Ahead and Jeff Nyschot’s Groove.\n\nAlso on hand will be the Lourdes Mission in Motion Mobile Mammography Unit — first brought to the field days in 2014 — available for mammograms from 12 to 4 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nFor families with children, the Broome County Sheriff Department’s table will be set up from 12 to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday to enroll children in the Safe Child ID Program.

Experts say travelers can reduce their chances of delays by avoiding certain places and leaving at certain times of day.\n\nExperts' advice: leave early.\n\n\"If you have to leave Friday, you want to arrange your trip so that you reach the chokepoint on your route before 1 p.m.,\" says Jamie Holter, a traffic analyst with INRIX, a Kirkland, Wash.-based firm that provides traffic information from 10 billion data points daily \"\n\nGas prices are not expected to be a factor this year, so there likely will be plenty of other drivers approaching those chokepoints. INRIX says holiday traffic in most places around the nation will be up 10% this year over Labor Day 2012.

Of those vacationers, 29.2 million will go by automobile, a 4.3% increase over last year. Over the Labor Day holiday, which AAA defines as Thursday through Monday, the number of travelers is expected to hit a new post-recession high – an increase attributed to the improving economy.\n\nSome parts of the U.S. will see even bigger increases, AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter says. In the Pacific region, which includes California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, the auto club expects a 5.7% increase in travel; the mountain region of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming will see a 5.4% jump.\n\nAcross the nation, the busiest day for outbound travel is Friday, when 46% of holiday travelers head out. \"Typically, Friday is a work day,\" Hunter says. \"So you have traffic from people who are working and people heading out on vacation, so it could be very congested.\"\n\nPeter Kissinger, who's heading out Saturday morning for his family vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Del., plans to leave an hour earlier than usual on the trip he's taken for the past 10 years. \"Everybody's going to be trying to get across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge,\" says Kissinger, head of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.\n\nDuring holiday getaways, it's a good idea to keep a cautious eye on the speedometer, says John Bowman of the National Motorists Association. \"Obviously, as with all holidays, we would expect to see aggressive traffic enforcement across the country,\" he says. \"You see police forces gearing up to do targeted enforcement operations. They typically focus on DUI, seat belt compliance and on speed traps.\"\n\nFor those making the return trip Monday, Holter advises hitting the road before noon. \"If your expected departure time is 10 or 11 a.m., get on the road for an hour or two and then stop for lunch,\" she says. \"Don't do lunch and then get on the road.\"\n\nThat's to beat the rush: According to AAA, the heaviest return day is Monday, when 43% will head back home. The auto club says 42% of holiday travelers will return home Tuesday or later. Many of them might find themselves caught in school-related congestion: Tuesday is the first day of school in many parts of the nation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2019/09/04/hurricane-dorian-southwest-floridas-tourism-industry-bounces-back/2199471001/", "title": "Hurricane Dorian: Southwest Florida's tourism industry bounces back", "text": "Hurricane Dorian spared Southwest Florida.\n\nThe region's tourism industry, however, still took a blow from the dangerous storm.\n\nMany hotels saw cancellations for the long Labor Day weekend — considered the \"last hurrah,\" or unofficial end of summer. Usually, hotels are filled to the brim, mostly with visitors from South Florida.\n\nThe severity and uncertainty of the storm put a damper on vacation plans.\n\nThere's a silver lining to the dark cloud of Dorian: Evacuees from Florida's east coast filled up some of the suddenly vacant rooms over the long weekend — and hotels have been busier than usual since Monday, with the state's storm-displaced residents still in house.\n\nPreviously:SWFL hotels, motels report cancellations, evacuees ahead of Dorian\n\nJack Wert, Collier County's tourism director, described occupancy as \"fairly full\" through Thursday.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" he said.\n\nTypically, Labor Day — and the two to three days that follow — are some of the slowest of the year for the region's tourism industry, with the last wave of kids returning to the classroom this week around the country, bringing an end to their months-long summer break.\n\nAt some area hotels, evacuees have made up for the lost leisure and business visitors. However, not every hotelier expects to come out ahead, especially ones on the beach, due to the anticipated bad weather and distraction of the storm over the weekend.\n\n\"We are going to end up with another record holiday weekend, in terms of occupancy, except for on the beach,\" Wert said.\n\nExclusive:Aerial photos of destruction in Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian\n\nHe offered up this example to show the lingering effects of Dorian: On Tuesday, the JW Marriott on Marco Island reported the availability of 400 rooms for Wednesday and Thursday, out of a little more than 800, which Wert described as less than usual and \"not a big deal,\" considering the time of year.\n\nAmanda Cox, the resort's director of sales and marketing, described the holiday weekend as good, but not great.\n\n\"We were not as busy as usual,\" she said. \"We normally sell out Labor Day weekend and finished closer to 75%.\"\n\nShe described Monday and Tuesday as \"slightly busier than usual due to the evacuee impact,\" with some of that business starting to taper off Wednesday.\n\nThe situation that unfolded over the weekend at the JW Marriott was dynamic, Cox said, with a whiplash of cancellations and bookings. Other hoteliers reported seeing the same kind of swings.\n\nIn fact, some evacuees cancelled their reservations on Saturday, only to rebook rooms for Sunday and Monday after Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm, then virtually stalled.\n\nBeach deserted\n\nJason Parsons, general manager of the Naples Beach Hotel & Golf Club, wasn't sure what to expect for the long holiday weekend after seeing a rash of cancellations Friday.\n\n\"We definitely experienced an overall decline in occupancy due to the storm,\" he said. \"We also experienced a decline in the local business. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't as busy as it usually is.\"\n\nDespite nice weather Saturday, the beach looked deserted, with fewer hotel guests and the locals likely holed up and wrapped up in news about the storm, Parsons said.\n\nSunday, he said, was a little better, and Monday was OK.\n\nReaching out:How Naples and Fort Myers are pitching in to help the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian\n\nThe good news? On Tuesday, the hotel's occupancy stood at 40%, much higher than usual with a \"bunch of evacuees\" still filling rooms, Parsons said.\n\nStill, he doesn't expect the hotel to come out ahead.\n\n\"Overall it is going to be coming down. There wasn't as many people out and about,\" Parsons said.\n\nAt the Ritz-Carltons in Naples, policies were relaxed to allow more guests with pets. Pets are normally allowed only in some of the rooms at the golf resort and not permitted at the beach resort, said Jaime Moench, sales and marketing director.\n\nMore:Efforts being made to get relief supplies to the Bahamas running into a variety of issues\n\nPhotos:Fort Myers businesses collect supplies to send to the Bahamas\n\nThe resorts also waived cancellation fees and reduced pricing to help out those looking for shelter, she said.\n\n\"We actually remained very busy through the weekend,\" Moench said.\n\nThe resorts were still bustling on Tuesday and Wednesday, with east cost evacuees, mostly from Palm Beach County, still waiting out the storm.\n\nDorian forced several groups to cancel meetings at both resorts, but most of those events will be rescheduled for later in the year, Moench said.\n\nSome events will go elsewhere.\n\nThe Florida Tomato Committee and the Florida Tomato Exchange planned to hold their annual Tomato Conference Sept. 3-5 at the beach resort — their longtime venue for the event — but cancelled those plans on Friday due to the storm.\n\n\"Will reschedule for early October, but it won’t be in Naples. Will be up near Tampa,\" said Michael Schadler, the exchange's executive vice president and manager for the committee, the state's tomato marketer and regulator, in an email.\n\nUp and down\n\nTourism has stood strong in Collier County this year. As of July, visitation was up 4.5% over the year, with spending rising 7% over those same months, according to the latest report by Tampa-based Research Data Services, a county consultant.\n\nIt's a different story in Lee County, which has seen declines in both visitation and spending this year. Some hoteliers have blamed the slowness on memories of last year's water woes, which generated national headlines.\n\nIn fact, Southwest Florida saw fewer visitors for the Labor Day weekend last year because red tide was so bad, plaguing Collier and Lee counties, killing off fish and stinking up the air.\n\nCoast is clear:For now, as wildlife begins comeback from devastating red tide bloom\n\nAnd:Will memories of last year's red tide in SWFL slow business this summer? Hotel owners, tourism officials differ\n\nLee County saw more problems than Collier did in 2018, with the added nuisance of blue-green algae.\n\nThe latest quarterly report for Lee County by Downs & St. Germain Research shows visitation falling by more than 6% over the year for April through June, with spending down 3.7%.\n\nVisitation was also off in the first quarter in Lee, but spending was still trending upward.\n\n\"Our business is flat to last year, but most hotels have been down,\" said Robert Boykin, owner of the Pink Shell Beach Resort and Marina on Fort Myers Beach.\n\nAsked about the reasons for the slowdown, he said: \"Why is likely due to new supply and the Caribbean market came back on line. That may change again, however.\"\n\nSouthwest Florida has seen a flurry of hotel construction over the past few years, leading to more competition and lower occupancy rates on average.\n\nOther factors that could be influencing Lee County's tourism numbers? Changes in the county's marketing research team and more visitation from couples, rather than larger families with children, said county spokeswoman Betsy Clayton.\n\n\"While it is true that having Hurricane Irma in 2017 and water quality issues in 2018 had some impact on repeat visitation, the decline is more due to party size. Also, remember that this is an estimate based on survey research. Approximately 300 surveys are conducted each month, both in-person and through email sent to recent visitors,\" she said.\n\nLike many hotels in Southwest Florida, the Pink Shell saw cancellations surge due to Dorian over the weekend. But it didn't draw evacuees to fill the empty rooms.\n\n\"We saw a few locals taking advantage of cheap rates for a getaway, but no inbound migration,\" Boykin said.\n\nThanks, Dorian:Hurricane Dorian pulls moisture from Florida, decreasing rain chances\n\nPlan accordingly:5 things that help before, during and after a hurricane, Dorian included\n\nThe Lani Kai Island Resort on Fort Myers Beach saw an influx of evacuees after dropping its no-pet policy to embrace east coast residents and their four-legged friends. The resort was virtually full over the weekend, but many evacuees left on Tuesday, said Melissa Schneider, marketing director.\n\n\"When things started looking better, they got anxious to head back home and get back to normal life,\" she said.\n\nWeekends are usually a much busier time for the resort and she expects business to return to normal by Friday.\n\nThe full impact of Dorian on the tourism industry won't truly be known for months.\n\n\"Any facts and figures from Dorian about economic impact will not statistically be immediately known to us,\" Clayton said.\n\nOne measure of the storm's impact will be its effect on tourist tax collections at hotels and other paid accommodations.\n\n\"We track bed-tax collections, which are due to the clerk of courts the month following the collections. We will not have September data until early November,\" she said.\n\nCollecting that data for Collier County will also take time.\n\nOthers see impact\n\nThe storm didn't just impact the area's hotels.\n\nAttractions also saw fewer visitors over the long holiday weekend. Crews installed storm shutters on the ground floor of some of the historic buildings at The Edison and Ford Winter Estates in Fort Myers ahead of the storm's arrival in Florida, but the venue remained open as usual over the weekend.\n\n\"It was definitely slower than usual,\" said Lisa Wilson, public relations director. \"We did see some visitors from the east coast and we also had some European tourists that would have already been here for their scheduled holiday.\"\n\nShe also attributed the slowness to fewer locals being out and about.\n\nZoomers in Fort Myers was also a little quieter than usual before and during the Labor Day weekend. Families and others cancelled birthday parties and other group events due to the uncertainty of the storm at a time when business is generally slower anyway.\n\nHelping hands:South Florida mobilizes to help Hurricane Dorian victims in the Bahamas\n\nPhotos:Volunteers collect donations for the Bahamas at Venue Naples\n\n\"Everybody was watching the news and expecting a lot of rain and a lot of wind that we didn't have,\" said Yicela Almeida, general manager. \"So it was slower.\"\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the attraction closed for maintenance and other upkeep for the three days after Labor Day, she said, but this year management decided to do the work around visitors since business is normally at a trickle during the week at this time of year, with kids back in school.\n\nRestaurants saw fewer customers too thanks to Dorian.\n\nIn Naples, Vin DePasquale, president and CEO of the Riverwalk restaurant at Tin City, said his holiday weekend business took a hit.\n\n\"The storm kind of quieted things down,\" he said. \"People were unsure about what they were doing. They were off and they were on.\"\n\nWhile the local customers still showed up, the restaurant didn't have \"any push for the holiday to speak of\" from out-of-town visitors, DePasquale said.\n\nThe uncertainty of the storm made it difficult for management at the longtime restaurant to plan for the weekend, especially when it came to knowing how much food to order and have on hand.\n\n\"It was a juggling act for us to keep everything fresh,\" DePasquale said. \"Normally, we have low inventory and high turnover. It worked out OK. After 40 years, we've figured some of that out.\"\n\nOther than the brief interruption of Dorian, he expects the year to turn out well for the restaurant and Tin City, which have made nice recoveries from Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nLooking ahead, DePasquale said the busy season \"looks good to me.\" Positive signs are out there, with carriers already spotted on the road filled with the arriving cars of seasonal residents from the north.\n\n\"I'm optimistic about it,\" he said. \"People are coming. The only thing that affected us last year was that bloom and the red tide, which hopefully we're not going to get like we did last year.

Or when my wife, Ellen, and I donned Hawaiian shirts and brought a plastic parrot to see his band perform at a traffic-clogged venue in Northern Virginia. Or when I picked “Little Miss Magic” for the first dance with our daughter at her wedding celebration.\n\nOr when I listened to Radio Margaritaville on SiriusXM for hours on end for soothing escapism during the pandemic. Or when I rushed to buy tickets to his jukebox “Escape to Margaritaville” musical on Broadway, despite less-than-stellar reviews.\n\nOr when I asked Ellen, who indulges my fandom but doesn’t necessarily share my enthusiasm for all things Jimmy, to get me his latest album for my 65th birthday. Or when I bought a drugstore magazine devoted to Jimmy’s 75th birthday. Or when … well, you get the idea.\n\nThe more interesting question isn’t when I became a Parrothead, but why I – and so many others – found him so appealing and were so affected by his death from cancer at 76 on Friday, the unofficial end of summer.\n\nJimmy Buffett, an American original in the tradition of Mark Twain\n\nThe answer, I think, isn’t immediately apparent to those who knew Buffett simply as a laid-back entertainer who parlayed his sole Top Ten hit, “Margaritaville,” into a sprawling business empire.\n\nAs a journalist, I admire good storytelling, and Buffett was, at heart, a writer and raconteur, an American original in the tradition of Mark Twain. Buffett, in fact, started his career as a correspondent for Billboard magazine. He wrote several books and was one of only six authors to top both the fiction and nonfiction bestseller lists of The New York Times.\n\nBuffett loved a good pun and clever wordplay: His band was the Coral Reefers, and one of his hits was “Last Mango in Paris.” Another song was titled “The Weather is Here, I Wish You Were Beautiful.”\n\nWhen he sang “my occupational hazard bein’ my occupation’s just not around” in “A Pirate Looks at Forty,” it struck a chord with a newspaper guy in a world turned digital.\n\nDon't dismiss 'Rich Men':Oliver Anthony's 'Rich Men North of Richmond' speaks to how Americans feel\n\nIn “Everybody’s on the Phone,” Buffett presciently lamented an era in which people are “so connected and all alone.”\n\nOf course, not all of Buffett’s lyrics were poetic or even tasteful. I cringed when, at a barbecue on the White House lawn early in the Clinton administration, the tent speakers blared Buffett’s “Why Don’t We Get Drunk (and Screw)” – perhaps foreshadowing the scandal involving the president and intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nI always envisioned Buffett touring into his 90s, like fellow balladeer Willie Nelson. I certainly thought he would outlive the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards, now 79. But it was not to be.\n\nFor all his association with hedonistic partying, Buffett thought, and sang, a lot about mortality.\n\n“Jamaica Mistaica” recounts the tale of his near-death experience in 1996, when one of his planes – carrying Buffett, Bono of U2 and family members – was shot at by Jamaican authorities, who suspected the Hemisphere Dancer was being used to smuggle drugs.\n\nSecretary of State Blinken:No quick solution to fentanyl crisis, but US is leading the fight\n\n“Death of an Unpopular Poet” tells the sad story of a poet “who lived before his time.” Posthumously, “his books are all bestsellers, and his poems were turned to song. Had his brother on a talk show, though they never got along.”\n\nAnd “He Went to Paris,” a haunting ballad acclaimed by Bob Dylan and others, depicts a veteran who lost his baby, his lady and one eye in the Spanish Civil War. “Through 86 years of perpetual motion, if he likes you he’ll smile then he’ll say, Jimmy, some of it’s magic, some of it’s tragic, but I had a good life all the way.”\n\nThat’s as fitting an epitaph as any for Buffett, who spent most of his 76 years in perpetual motion and was content to leave a legacy that he enjoyed himself and made a lot of people happy along the way.\n\nBut, at least for now, there is no joy in Margaritaville.

And like every other summer season, your sprint to Monday – Labor Day – seemed a blur.\n\nFor many, Labor Day is all about capturing that last blast at the beach, backyard barbecues, school retail bonanzas and the grudging realization that sun-soaked play days are no more.\n\nBut the day has a deeper meaning and marks a pivotal moment in U.S. labor history — and it had a pretty violent start.\n\nIn the late 1800s, the state of labor was grim as U.S. workers toiled under bleak conditions: 12 or more hour workdays; hazardous work environments; meager pay. Children, some as young as 5, were often fixtures at plants and factories.\n\nThe dismal livelihoods fueled the formation of the country’s first labor unions, which began to organize strikes and protests and pushed employers for better hours and pay. Many of the rallies turned violent.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 1882 — a Tuesday — 10,000 workers took unpaid time off to march in a parade from City Hall to Union Square in New York City as a tribute to American workers. Organized by New York’s Central Labor Union, It was the country’s first unofficial Labor Day parade. Three years later, some city ordinances marked the first government recognition, and legislation soon followed in a number of states.\n\nThen came May 11, 1894, and a strike that shook an Illinois town founded by George Pullman, an engineer and industrialist who created the railroad sleeping car. The community, located on the Southside of Chicago, was designed as a “company town” in which most of the factory workers who built Pullman cars lived.\n\nMore:Expect relief at the pump with gas prices predicted to fall after Labor Day\n\nMore:Labor Day 2018: What cars and trucks rule for holiday road trips?\n\nMore:Your favorite stores are having amazing Labor Day Weekend sales\n\nWhen wage cuts hit, 4,000 workers staged a strike that pitted the American Railway Union vs. the Pullman Company and the federal government. The strike and boycott against trains triggered a nationwide transportation nightmare for freight and passenger traffic.\n\nAt its peak, the strike involved about 250,000 workers in more than 25 states. Riots broke out in many cities; President Grover Cleveland called in Army troops to break the strikers; more than a dozen people were killed in the unrest.\n\nAfter the turbulence, Congress, at the urging of Cleveland in an overture to the labor movement, passed an act on June 28, 1894, making the first Monday in September “Labor Day.” It was now a legal holiday.\n\nIn the coming decades, the day took root in American culture as the \"unofficial end of summer\" and is marked by parades, picnics and family/friend time. Post offices, banks, courts, federal and state offices are shuttered.\n\nSome herald the new beginnings that dot the post-Labor Day months – the NFL in full swing, election season in high gear, the first frost, fall's colors.\n\nBut for those mourning another summer that slipped from sight, start the countdown clock: Memorial Day is 267 days away.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2022/08/29/15-labor-day-events-across-oklahoma-for-celebrating-the-end-of-summer/65457663007/", "title": "15 Labor Day events across Oklahoma where you can celebrate the ...", "text": "With Labor Day coming up on Sept. 5, the unofficial end of summer is almost here.\n\nAcross the Sooner State, this year's end-of-season festivities include the in-person return of the Cherokee National Holiday and Choctaw Nation Labor Day Festival after two years of cancellations or limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the debut of an anticipated new glass art collection at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art; and a lineup of more than 40 current and classic rock acts at Rocklahoma.\n\nFor those who are ready for one more summertime celebration before fall swoops in, here are 15 events happening across the Sooner State over Labor Day weekend:\n\n1.

Not on Labor Day", "text": "For much of the country Labor Day signals the unofficial end of summer.\n\nBreak out the sweaters! Open the windows! Pumpkin spice is no longer months too early!\n\nYeah, well. Not in Arizona.\n\nThe one-two punch of early school starts and blistering heat that lasts till October means Labor Day in Arizona is just, well, another Monday. A Monday most people don’t have to work, at least.\n\nBut it’s not the unofficial end of anything. In fact it’s more like the unofficial middle — the middle of summer, the longest slog. If Labor Day signals hope everywhere else, in Arizona it just signals more gargantuan cooling bills, swimming pools too warm to enjoy and steering wheels still too molten to touch.\n\nLabor Day weekend road trips:These Arizona events are worth the drive\n\nLabor Day is the cookout holiday. Don't mind our searing heat\n\nI understand that Labor Day is a genuine holiday, established to honor the labor movement in the United States. That’s important and deserves recognition.\n\nBut in the manner of Presidents Day becoming synonymous with sales on mattresses, Labor Day has become the cookout holiday, the last gasp of grilling outdoors and throwing the Frisbee around while music plays on the patio or whatever.\n\nEVERYWHERE BUT HERE.\n\nWell, it’s pretty hot in Death Valley, too. But you know what I mean — Arizona is hot and it’s going to stay hot until you’ve taken down your Halloween decorations. We’ll resume patio life sometime in early November.\n\nLabor Day here is basically a demented Groundhog Day here, except it’s the same thing every year: six more weeks of summer.\n\nI grew up in Virginia. At that time, like most states back East, school didn’t start until the Tuesday after Labor Day. Thus, the unofficial end of summer. (If you played football, alas, the end of summer came on Aug. 10, the beginning of two-a-day practices. This was also the end of happiness in any form.)\n\nIt was an easy marker on the calendar. And a cookout, even if it has nothing to do with the intention of the holiday, was always a sure bet. Hot dogs, hamburgers and radio-station countdowns were the staples.\n\nBarf alert:Hot dog-flavored candy? Why Tailgate Candy Corn tastes like a mistake\n\nBut if I have to listen to the top-500-classic-rock-songs-of-all-time countdown to find out, yawn, whether this year’s No. 1 is “Stairway to Heaven” or “Free Bird” — and no one is saying I do have to listen, but if it’s right there … — I would at least like to be outside at a cookout.\n\nBy which I mean a cookout where you can be outside for more than 3 minutes before your skin starts to turn to withered parchment.\n\nYeah, yeah, I also understand that people in Arizona do have Labor Day cookouts. People with pools. And lots and lots of coolers and ice. Misters are a nice touch, as well. But it’s not the same.\n\nLife, death and relish:You can't go home again, but some flavors will get you close\n\nHalloween is the real end of summer in Arizona\n\nI mentioned Halloween. I’ve lived in Arizona for a long time, and as long as I’ve been here, that’s been our real Labor Day, at least in terms of signaling the end of summer. Although I should also point out that when my children were little there were years when we had to make last-minute costume changes because it was too hot to wear the original item.\n\nThere are people who will tell you that they don’t mind Arizona's endless scorching summers because the mild winters more than make up for it. These people are liars. Or at best, disingenuous. Or maybe just crazy.\n\nHello again:New AZ Family reporter talks about coming back to Phoenix\n\nStaring down Labor Day on the calendar and knowing it doesn’t mean a change of seasons is just demoralizing, a cruel joke.\n\nT.S. Eliot says April is the cruelest month. That's because he never lived in Phoenix. Everyone in town is in a bad mood in September. It’s an endurance test. So enjoy your Labor Day everywhere else. We’ll just keep on roasting.\n\nAlthough I do enjoy the hot dogs.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter: @goodyk.

Harvey helping hands. A shout-out to everyone, anywhere, who onsite has helped hurricane victims in coastal Texas, donated items from afar, given money and offered prayers and other encouraging words. If we could bottle the spirit of unity in times of duress and pour that on each other when times are good, we’d really have something going.\n\n2. Football kicks off. The Christmas holidays sentimentally may be the most wonderful time of the year but football is a close second in Texas. The new season is under way, and congrats to the Eastland Mavericks for notching the first 11-man victory, winning Thursday over Merkel. Good luck to all teams, and safety to the players and fans making road trips.\n\n3. Like Mike. Those who attended Thursday evening’s concert by former Abilenian Michael McCown, who for 18 years has sung for the Frankfurt, Germany, opera, were treated to his wonderful voice and timeless hymns. Marc Sanders accompanied on piano. Thank you, gentlemen, for an uplifting evening.\n\n4. Fall-ish weather. If the weather is like a spigot, someone turned it to the right this week, cutting off the heat. We went from summer hot to October pleasant, with lows hitting the upper 50s. How refreshing was that! Warm days are ahead still, but we were thankful for the break.\n\n5. How ‘bout that mayor? Since he was elected, Mayor Anthony Williams has been contributing op-ed pieces to our Other Views page on Sundays in the Reporter-News. He has another ready to go this weekend, talking about building community within our community through the Abilene Neighborhood Initiative. We appreciate him digging deeper into the issues that affect Abilene and setting an agenda to get things done. It's a great example of pro-active leadership.\n\n6. Holiday weekend. Labor Day weekend is the unofficial end of summer. It comes at the perfect time for beleaguered students, some of whom have been in school a whole week already! Looks like a nice weekend for grilling and catching our collective breath before the busy fall starts rolling. Or starts rolling faster.\n\nDISLIKES\n\n1. Presidential protesters. One thing we all can agree on is that not everyone agrees about the president. But President Trump and Vice President Pence made on-the-ground trips to Texas, as they should have, to promise federal support for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Some took the opportunity to protest the administration, holding signs and shouting. Instead, these folks should have put their hands to work helping in the recovery and offering words of encouragement.\n\n2. But then … The Tweeter in Chief, as some call Trump, could not resist commenting on social media between two trips to Texas (he is supposed to be in the Houston area Saturday). Maybe he’ll drop his phone in floodwater and give us all a break.\n\n3. Tired of this. Getting a low tire looked at this week, we were told it may not be a flat. A prank of choice recently has been letting air out of tires, or slashing them. Really? Our tire had a screw in it. That almost seemed better than being of victim of a senseless mischief.\n\nMOURNING\n\n1. Rollie role model. We were saddened by news of death of basketball coach Rollie Massimino. The roly-poly coach led underdog Villanova to the NCAA championship in 1985 but he also was more fondly remembered by many for teaching and coaching at the junior high and high school levels before going to 'Nova. He coached for 32 more years after Villanova’s title season. That is a full life worth noting, a man who was more than just a successful coach.\n\nHMMM\n\n1. How do you spell relief ... F-I-L-L-U-P. A man on security duty at the gas pumps at H-E-B recounted Thursday evening how dozens and dozens of vehicles flooded the area earlier in the day to buy gas. Yes, it was the cheapest price we saw, as other stations raised prices. But why the panic that we wouldn’t have gas in Abilene? Some folks were filling gas containers ... large ones. We saw cars four deep at H-E-B well after 9 p.m. Keep calm and drive on.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/02"}]}

It was so big that it had to be delivered around midnight, because the state Department of Transportation had to shut down Delaware Avenue to allow for a crew and crane to install the behemoth.\n\nThe machinery is part of a two-story, 11,800-square-foot expansion of the Life Sciences Research Facility on Delaware Avenue that was started in last March and is slated to finish early this year.\n\nThe fMRI will be considered a \"core research facility,\" meaning no single department or college owns it. Robert Simons, chairman of the Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences, says the device will be useful for researchers of many disciplines, starting with psychology, health sciences and engineering.\n\n\"This is, at the moment, the most state-of-the-art magnet in the world,\" Simons said. \"There are others out there, but not many. This puts us on par with all the top research universities in our area.\"\n\nA functional MRI is different from a regular MRI, Simons says, in that it can show what parts of the body are currently active. Scans of the brain, for example, will \"light up\" when different sections are in use.\n\nThat allows scientists to understand what parts of the brain are responsible for what actions, and it also allows them to map how neurons are connected.\n\n\"When you look at a brain in an MRI, you can sort of see what it looks like, but you can't really see very clearly what is connected to what,\" he said. \"There are pathways in the brain that can only be worked out using the functional use of the machine.\"\n\nTimothy Vickery, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences, studies how \"reward centers\" in the brain are connected during learning, which helps explain how humans use past experiences to make decisions. The fMRI will help him see when those reward centers are lit up.\n\n“I’m very, very excited about the MRI facility, and I think it will be an important research and recruitment tool for Psychological and Brain Sciences as well as many other departments and colleges throughout the University,” Vickery told the university's UDaily website. “I am sure that it will have a large impact on undergraduate education as well.”\n\nCurrently, UD researchers must travel to other places, as far as the University of Maryland, if their research requires the use of fMRI. Places that have the devices, like Philadelphia, are in high demand and often have long waiting lists.\n\nDemand for fMRIs as sophisticated as UD's new machine is big enough that Simons expects the university will attract researchers from elsewhere in the region. The cost of using the machine hasn't been finalized, but is estimated at $500-$800 an hour.\n\nIt's not just psychologists who will benefit from the machine, Simons says. Researchers studying physical therapy and exercise science will be able to see, for example, how joints are stressed or affected by disabilities.\n\nDawn Elliot, director of UD's biological engineering program, studies how discs in the spine compress the body ages. She's been studying humans and goats, and has previously been forced to haul goats to a University of Pennsylvania facility in Center City Philadelphia to use the MRI there.\n\n“This type of imaging is critically important, not just for psychology but also for biomedical engineering and health sciences,” Elliot told UDaily. “Having this here will be a big benefit to my research and to many others.”\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/06/14/uncle-davids-ice-cream-shop-coming-to-rehoboth-avenue-this-month/73817744007/", "title": "Uncle David's Ice Cream Shop coming to Rehoboth Avenue this month", "text": "Don't have a good excuse to get ice cream while in Rehoboth Beach?

Nineteen years ago, she started celebrating Samson's annual summer trip to Rehoboth with a boardwalk stroll.

You'll want to think ahead.\n\nThis year is expected to be the third busiest Thanksgiving travel season since AAA began tracking the November holiday travel in 2000, the motor club said last week.\n\nAAA predicts that 54.6 million people will travel 50 miles or more from home, nearing pre-pandemic levels. The motor club considers the holiday travel period Wednesday, Nov. 23, to Sunday, Nov. 27.\n\nMost people will be driving − close to 50 million, to be exact. But another 4.5 million will be flying, despite airline schedules still being reduced by about 20%, according to AAA.\n\nThis means that not only will the roads be congested, but so too will airports. Mary Maguire, vice president of public and government affairs at AAA northeast, said TSA lines will be long and suggested not checking a bag to avoid issues if a flight is delayed or canceled.\n\nAir travel is expected to be up nearly 8% from last year.\n\nWhile driving and flying are the two most common modes of transport, nearly 1.5 million Americans will be taking the bus, train and even cruise ships, up 23% from 2021.\n\n“With travel restrictions lifted and more people comfortable taking public transportation again, it’s no surprise buses, trains, and cruises are coming back in a big way,” Maguire said.\n\nWhat to do if you're driving\n\nIt comes as no surprise that metro areas are expected to see the busiest roads.\n\nHighways in and around Atlanta, Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles will be the busiest, though Boston and Washington, D.C., will also see heavy traffic.\n\nNew York City is expected to see a 158% increase in traffic over typical, already-high levels, while Washington is expected to see an 85% increase. I-95 will be the most congested, AAA predicts.\n\nPhiladelphia is not listed as a peak metro area, though it has been in previous years.\n\nTo avoid some of the worst jams, AAA recommends traveling early Wednesday morning or before 11 a.m. on Thanksgiving. The worst times to travel will be between 4 and 8 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWhat does the weather look like?\n\nPotential wintery weather may also contribute to delays in Thanksgiving travel.\n\nWhile it remains too early to tell, a storm may develop in the Carolinas late this week, which may then move east of the Delmarva Peninsula, potentially bringing chilly rain to Delaware and the Philadelphia area. It's unlikely the region would see snow, though the far Northeast could get some.\n\nStill, the forecast remains up in the air.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

The first Pride parades took place in major U.S. cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles the next year.\n\nToday, Pride Month presents an opportunity for visibility and community. In addition to celebrating LGBTQ love and joy, it’s also a time to highlight important policy and resource issues the community faces. In 2021, NYC Pride banned law enforcement presence at Pride events through 2025 because of escalating violence “against marginalized groups, specifically BIPOC and trans communities.”\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign, 130 bills targeting trans rights have been filed and 325 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been proposed in 2024. More than 650 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2023.\n\nDelaware's ongoing LGBTQ+ activism\n\nLast September, the Delaware Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs and Government Information Center launched a digital LGBTQ+ History of Delaware archive.\n\nThe project highlights dozens of stories of influential activists in Delaware who advanced LGBTQ+ rights, places in Delaware with a history of LGBTQ+ acceptance and influential moments in statewide history.\n\nA timeline is featured in the database dating back to pre-colonial days of Delaware, going through the history of notable pieces of LGBTQ+ legislation, movements and figures.\n\nDelaware became the 17th state to pass a ban on the \"LGBTQ+ panic\" defense in a court of law last October, which aims to protect LGBTQ+ residents from becoming victims of violence.\n\nIn December of 2023, House Bill 275 was introduced proposing to include asexuality and pansexuality into the Delaware Code relating to \"sexual orientation.\" Asexuality refers to an individual with little to no sexual attraction to others and pansexuality refers to individuals whose sexual or romantic attraction is not based on their partner's gender identity or sex. The bill passed the House in March and was reported out of the Senate's Health and Social Services Committee as of Wednesday, May 22.\n\nActivism for LGBTQ+ rights, especially among youth groups continues to spread statewide. In November, the Delaware Division of Public Health confirmed that it had to cut $1.8 million in HIV prevention programs beginning this year due to reductions in federal funding, a move that will likely require certain HIV counseling and testing services to be cut.\n\nWhere to celebrate Pride Month in Delaware\n\nThere are a number of Pride events taking place in and around Delaware this month.\n\nDelaware Pride Festival\n\nThe state’s largest annual Pride celebration is returning Saturday, June 1, at Legislative Hall in Dover.\n\nBetween 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., the event will host dozens of vendors, drag performers, live music and speakers. The event is free attendance and family-friendly, with activities for people of all ages to enjoy.\n\nAlso in Dover, the Biggs Museum in Dover will be holding a Delaware Pride at the Biggs event on June 1. Between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., admission into the museum will be free and giveaways will be taking place of posters featuring artwork by local LGBTQ+ artists.\n\nRehoboth Beach Pride\n\nFrom Thursday, July 18, to Sunday, July 21, Rehoboth will host its Pride celebration.\n\nThe annual festival will be held July 20 from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. at the Rehoboth Beach Convention Center.\n\nThe events will be free and open to all who want to celebrate or learn more about Pride celebrations. LGBTQ+ resources, health screening, craft vendors, performances and more will be available.\n\nThe Convention Center also will host the Funny Girlz, made up of comedians Roxanna Ward, Vickie Shaw and Lisa Koch in a Pride Comedy Night and Dance performance. Doors will open Saturday, July 20, at 5:30 p.m. and a dance party will follow the comedy show starting at 8:15 p.m.\n\nPublic health issue:How Delaware aims to strengthen women's reproductive rights with these bills\n\nGraduation gown controversy:'A change in school culture': A year after speaking out, Concord HS GSA continues advocacy\n\nWilmington’s Pride Events\n\nWilmington will celebrate Pride Month in its own way, too.\n\nThe Docklands Divas Drag Brunch will take place Sunday, June 2, at the Docklands Riverfront. Tickets are $20 and colorful attire is encouraged.\n\nFashion lovers can make their way to the stage Saturday, June 8, from 6 to 10 p.m. in Wilmington’s Community Education building for City Pride: Express Yourself Fashion Runway Show, where people can express themselves through their best creative outfits and celebrate the city’s pride.\n\nThe Queen will host its “Pride in WILM” event with a comedy show from headliner and viral comedian Jessica Kirson on Friday, June 21, starting at 7:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased online.\n\nOther Pride Month events\n\nThe Brandywine Zoo also will host its fourth annual Pride Day event on Saturday, June 22, from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Admission into the event is included in regular zoo admission and will feature a day of educational programming, a scavenger hunt, story time and more. Pride gear is encouraged!\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for bar crawls around your area in honor of Pride Month.

And both Rascal Flatts (Harrington Raceway and Casino) and Rucker (the Freeman Stage at Bayside near Selbyville) returned to play Delaware in 2013.\n\nGilbert is the hottest act on this year's bill with his new album, \"The Devil Don't Sleep,\" sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, which also features Pardi's \"California Sunrise\" at the No. 10 spot.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: If you do not see a poll question below, please refresh this page.\n\nAfter Big Barrel and Delaware Junction Country Music Festival arrived in Delaware in 2015, the state fair had planned for a lighter-than-normal country lineup for 2016. But when both major festivals closed after one year, fair officials were left scrambling to pump more of fan-favorite country into the mix.\n\nThis year, they were prepared. Four of the seven entertainment acts are country.\n\n\"This year, we knew going in that we wanted to go back to our model of four nights of country since it's the genre of choice for folks coming out to the fair,\" says Danny Aguilar, Delaware State Fair assistant general manager.\n\nJust like last year when the fair hosted a musical act on the night before its official opening for the first time – country star Jake Owen drew about 5,000 fans while the rest of the fairgrounds were dark – the fair will host Pardi for a special fair kickoff show on Wednesday, July 19.\n\nThere will be no gate admission charge for Pardi because the fair’s carnival rides, livestock animals and circus performers will not be up and running.\n\n\"The stage and food vendors are in place, and since it worked out well, we're doing it again,\" Aguilar says. \"And the livestock exhibitors really liked it because they can actually attend a concert.\"\n\nThere was only one miscue. Because there was only a show running that night, some fans thought they could drive in and park right on the fairgrounds by the track instead of the normal Delaware State Fair parking areas.\n\n\"We'll be ready this year with security and such,\" Aguilar adds.\n\nRecently, the fair introduced a standing-room-only pit in front of the Grandstand stage, and last year it added a loft called the Roost with preferred seating, private bathrooms and VIP parking passes. Both will be back this year, although the Roost will have only one viewing platform instead of two.\n\nA more spacious track seating layout with extra legroom also will return after the Grandstand shrank from a 9,800-person capacity to 7,647 in 2016.\n\nOther than a few of the fair's major recent bookings – acts like Luke Bryan and Toby Keith, who can draw large-scale crowds – some seats had largely remained empty for other shows, leading to the change.\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to find artists who can sell 10,000 seats at the fair and still fit within our budget,\" Aguilar says. \"We want to focus on keeping our tickets at a reasonable price and target more artists.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and − several years later − drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nWhy is that allegedly a crime?\n\nBiden faces three firearms felonies.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nBiden filled out the form and that he made a false statement, specifically that he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knew that statement was false.\n\nThat the statement was meant to deceive the salesman on a fact material to the sale. In other words: the sale would not have occurred had he answered otherwise.\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nBiden was either an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knowingly possessed the firearm.\n\nThat he knew he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden’s own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir “Beautiful Things.” In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, “I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden’s brother and Hunter Biden’s former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden’s conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction’s understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n“Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,” Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe judge:Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed plea deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2021/10/08/q-collar-gives-bills-linebacker-klein-sense-of-protection/119030502/", "title": "Q-Collar gives Bills linebacker Klein sense of protection", "text": "AP\n\nBuffalo Bills linebacker A.J. Klein wears a unique, protective necklace that’s become as much part of his uniform as his helmet and shoulder pads.\n\nThe Q-Collar is a non-invasive device worn around the neck to aid in the protection of the brain from effects associated with repetitive, sub-concussive head impacts. A plastic band made with a spring-loaded steel core slips around the neck. The band places about 1.2 pounds of pressure onto the wearer’s internal jugular vein, which carries oxygen-free blood from the brain back to the heart.\n\nDr. Julian Bailes, the former team physician for the Pittsburgh Steelers, began researching different ways to protect the brain during sports participation over a decade ago. After he was approached by inventor Dr. David Smith, Bailes studied how to protect the brain from the inside instead of simply putting more protective layers around it.\n\n“Knowing that helmets don’t prevent concussions and they don’t prevent brain injuries, helmets protect against skull fractures and in most cases brain hemorrhage and facial injuries, but they can’t protect against brain injury because the brain is freely able to move and stretch and twist fibers, so we were looking at it a different way,” Bailes said.\n\nThe result was the Q-Collar, which received marketing clearance from the FDA in February. Klein has been wearing it since five-time All-Pro linebacker Luke Kuechly introduced him to it when they played together in Carolina.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“I looked at all the research and I decided to wear it,” Klein said. “If anything, it’s going to make me feel more secure, more protected. It’s actually weird now. If I don’t have it on when I’m on the field, I feel kind of naked. So it’s one of those things that I have adapted to that I feel like I have to wear one.”\n\nTwo-time Pro Bowl tight end Vernon Davis began wearing one after suffering several concussions.\n\n“Once I was introduced to it, I wore it all the time,” said Davis, who played for San Francisco, Denver and Washington from 2006-19. “I would wear it when I was riding my bike. Whatever it was, if I had to do something with physical activity, I was wearing it.”\n\nLEADERS IN SPORTS AWARD\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the winner of the 2021 Inclusion Award for the team’s efforts as a leader in gender equality.\n\nThe announcement was made at Twickenham Stadium in London at the 7th annual Leaders Sports Awards banquet, celebrating organizations that are pushing boundaries and setting the example throughout the sports industry.\n\n“Establishing a culture of inclusivity is important to the team and our belief in supporting opportunities for individuals from all backgrounds,” said Bucs co-owner Darcie Glazer Kassewitz.\n\nLeaders in Sport evaluated projects and initiatives that foster inclusion, equality and diversity, and appeal to communities irrespective of age, sexuality, gender, disability, religion or belief. The group cited the Bucs as “the embodiment of the inclusion category.”\n\n“Through the team and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Foundation, their programs have created change in a male-dominated industry, demonstrating how football is a game for everyone, regardless of gender. The Inclusion Award is designed to celebrate and award those who have challenged the norm within sport ...\" the organization noted.\n\nUnder Kassewitz’s leadership, the Buccaneers have established the Jr. Bucs Girls Flag Football League, Tampa’s first girls flag football league, and the Jr. Bucs School Program, the single largest in-school program in team history, impacting nearly 200,000 students in 300 schools across Tampa Bay.\n\nLast year, the Buccaneers launched the Girls in Football Scholarship, becoming the first NFL team to create an academic college scholarship for high school seniors who play football and are pursuing a career in sports.\n\nCATCHING BRADY\n\nSo now that Tom Brady holds the NFL record for yards passing, who is in line to catch him?\n\nNobody, really.\n\nAccording to Sidelines, which analyzed data for each quarterback’s average season passing yards, reaching more than 80,000 yards through the air might be, well, a reach.\n\nClosest is Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger, who would need about five more seasons to get there. Struggling this season, Big Ben is more likely to retire after 2021.\n\nMatt Ryan, who is with a rebuilding Atlanta Falcons team, also would need five years. At least Ryan would only be 40 then; Roethlisberger would need to keep playing until he is 43.\n\nAaron Rodgers needs about six seasons, which also would bring him to age 43. At least Rodgers still seems to be at his peak.\n\nIt's a long way off for the likes of Russell Wilson (12 seasons) Patrick Mahomes (14) and Dak Prescott (15), but at least they are at or approaching their prime.\n\nThen again, Brady might put that record into six figures.\n\nAUTISM CHALLENGE\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles Autism Foundation and the 2021 Eagles Autism Challenge raised more than $2.7 million for autism research and care, thanks to donors from 15 countries, 1,850 participants, and 12,819 donations.\n\nAll of the participant-raised funds will be directed to autism research and programs.\n\nSince the first year of the Eagles Autism Challenge in 2018, 36 countries and 76,788 donations have contributed to the more than $12 million raised.\n\n“We all clearly know the passion that Eagles fans have for their football team,\" says team owner Jeffrey Lurie, \"but more importantly, I have found over the years that it is their generosity, empathy, and commitment to important causes such as this that truly define them. The progress we have made – which has positively impacted so many families around the world – would not be possible without our fans and supporters of the Eagles Autism Foundation. As we reflect on this amazing year, we also look ahead to a future of endless possibilities thanks to the support that we are so fortunate to have.”\n\nParticipants had the option to choose from three cycling routes in addition to a 5K Run/Walk and a family friendly Sensory Walk. Supporters who wanted to fundraise but were unable to ride, run, or walk had the option to register as a virtual participant.\n\n“While this past year and a half has presented us all with many unique challenges, the one remaining constant has been the unwavering dedication to our mission by everyone who has embarked on this journey with us,” said Ryan Hammond, executive director of the Eagles Autism Foundation. “Every dollar raised by the Eagles Autism Foundation is invested back into cutting-edge autism research and care at the top medical institutions in North America.\"\n\nThe Eagles Autism Foundation is inviting researchers to apply for grant funding to support basic and clinical autism research, studies concentrating on impacted individuals and families, and diverse model systems.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in 54 people living in the United States are on the autism spectrum.\n\nFALCONS’ FRANKS GETS TE LOOK\n\nAtlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith isn’t hiding the fact he is following the lead of division rival New Orleans' use of Taysom Hill as he explores backup quarterback Feleipe Franks’ versatility.\n\nJust as the Saints have utilized Hill, the Falcons gave Franks a brief look at tight end in the rookie’s first action in the team's lone win so far, at the New York Giants. On the active roster for the first time, Franks played two snaps at tight end. He also took one snap at quarterback, handing off.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 235-pound Franks broke free on some quarterback runs in the preseason. Smith described the former Arkansas and Florida quarterback as “a hell of an athlete.”\n\nFranks signed with Atlanta as an undrafted rookie. Smith said the idea of using Franks at other positions has “kind of evolved.”\n\n“I think New Orleans kind of set the stage for everybody, and everybody’s been looking for that type,” Smith said. ”... Taysom’s the only guy that I’ve seen that truly can play multiple spots. ... We’ll continue to kind of kick the tires on it, see if it gives us anything, but it’s credit to Feleipe because Feleipe’s worked really hard about trying to become a professional quarterback.”\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Barry Wilner and Rob Maaddi and Sports Writer Charles Odum contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2015/05/22/things-summer/27778631/", "title": "55 things to do this summer", "text": "Shane Nyman\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nSummer — that magical time of year that takes an eternity to arrive and then bolts in an instant — unofficially begins with Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThere's a lot to do and only so many days to fit in all in.

Dad winked and pulled a $20 bill out of his wallet and he got change back.\n\nThose days are gone, replaced by fast-food prices shooting up because of inflation. According to a report in USA TODAY, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest reading from the so-called fast-food index saw annual inflation for the sector come in at 4.8%. The BLS also found that prices in \"limited-service restaurants\" increased by 47% since 2014.\n\nWhile the prices have shot up, demand for convenient meals has increased. Between 2013 and 2016, 36.6% of adults consumed fast food on a given day, according to a 2018 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Market research company Drive Research reported in 2023 that 65% of respondents ate fast food once a week.\n\nWith demand up and the post-COVID-19 world being hit by inflation, the cost of a Big Mac, Whopper, Dave's Single and Famous Star burger have risen.\n\nWhat's the average cost of a signature combo meal?\n\nHow fast have fast food prices risen? After years of slight increases, the prices have gone up dramatically.\n\nRecently, USA TODAY surveyed fast-food restaurants' signature meals to find out the average cost. The meals chosen were:\n\nMcDonald's Big Mac combo\n\nWendy's Dave's Single with cheese combo\n\nBurger King's Whopper with cheese combo\n\nHardee's Famous Star Combo\n\nThe results showed McDonald's had the most affordable signature combo at $9.72. Wendy's was second at $10.79, Burger King was third at $10.93 and Hardee's was fourth at $11.68.\n\nUsing Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to access fastfoodmenuprices.com website from 2013 moving forward, you can see fast food prices were stagnant until this year.\n\nOver the last year, the price of the signature combos has shot up $3-$4.\n\nWhat's the average cost of a signature combo meal in Delaware?\n\nWhile every franchise owner can set its prices, the cost of the signature meals throughout the First State is rather consistent. After looking at the McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Hardee's menus throughout the state, here's what we found:\n\nDelaware's average prices are, for the most part, lower, roughly 90 cents cheaper than the national averages. The only combo that is more expensive is the McDonald's Big Mac combo, which was 28 cents higher than the national average. However, it's still an increase from where the national average was a year ago.\n\nWhile still more affordable, the prices are almost putting the fast food giants into the same area as restaurants like Applebees, which sells a Classic Cheeseburger with fries in Wilmington for $13.29, or Chili's, which sells an Oldtimer with cheese and fries in Christiana for $12.29.\n\nMcDonald's secret menu item:McDonald's Dinner Box may be a secret menu item, but we have a way to find it\n\nFree Chicken McNuggets:When the Phillies win, McDonald's has a deal waiting for you\n\nHow does Delaware's prices compare with other cities?\n\nUSA TODAY reporters looked at the average cost of the signature combos in several cities throughout the country. Here's a look at how their finding compared to Delaware.\n\nLooking at the prices along the East Coast, Delaware's prices are generally in line with cities within the region. It's cheaper to get a signature meal in Delaware than in New York, but, in other cities, it depends on the restaurant.\n\nA glance across the country shows fast food in the First State is a better value than on the West Coast, but Delaware's prices were higher than Chicago and Houston.\n\nMcDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King fight inflation\n\nAs previously reported, McDonald's was hit with backlash after the New York Post reported last July that a McDonald's at a Connecticut rest stop was charging $18 for a Big Mac combo meal. In February, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski committed to an affordable menu in 2024.\n\nMcDonald's is delivering on that promise with $5 value meals starting June 25. They also have special sharable meals found on its app that provide large quantities of food for a low price. Each restaurant has a shareable menu.\n\nAccording to a USA TODAY story, Burger King announced its own $5 meal deal set to arrive in June. Wendy's announced a $3 breakfast combo in addition to weekly free chicken nugget deals through the Wendy's app and limited promotions.\n\nMary Walrath-Holdridge contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/10/5-poisonous-plants-avoid-delaware-summer/7533334001/", "title": "5 poisonous plants to avoid in Delaware this summer", "text": "After a long winter, flowers aren't the only thing blooming in Delaware.\n\nThe First State is host to poison ivy, oak and sumac, as well as poison hemlock and the equally poisonous spotted water hemlock, but you shouldn’t let that keep you from enjoying the outdoors.\n\n“It’s really just being aware of your surroundings when out in nature or in areas that are overgrown,” said the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension’s Blake Moore.\n\nReactions to contact with poisonous plants vary greatly. A mere brush with them will usually result in a rash at worst, but everyone reacts differently, experts say, so it’s important to know how to identify poisonous plants and steer clear.\n\nThe most extreme reactions, to include death, usually result from the ingestion of poisonous plants or the inhalation of their toxins.\n\nPoison ivy, oak and sumac\n\nAll three of these plants release urushiol, an oil that can cause a rash or even blisters in humans, but poison ivy is likely the only one you’ll ever come across in Delaware.\n\nPoison ivy is common and widespread, and Moore pointed out it’s a native plant with wildlife value. Various birds and mammals feed on the berries.\n\nPLANTS:Smothering vines, burning bushes among invasive plants in Delaware. Try these natives.\n\n“But it’s not something we want around our homes,” he said.\n\nThe old saying, “Leaves of three, let it be,” holds true. While some harmless plants also have three leaves, poison ivy’s appearance can be so varied, it’s best to avoid any plant with clusters of three leaves.\n\n“The leaves can be round or serrated. It can grow as a vine, ground cover, up trees. It has that big, long, hairy root that can grow up trees,” said Garret Valencik, the Delaware Department of Agriculture’s noxious weed program manager.\n\nPoison oak and sumac are “documented but uncommon,” Moore said, and are usually seen in only deep woods or wetlands.\n\nENVIRONMENT:Sussex changes wetland protections amid growth, but exceptions worry environmental groups\n\nPoison oak is a low shrub that shares poison ivy’s three-leaf clusters. Its leaves are fuzzy and lobed with rounded tips, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPoison sumac can appear as a low shrub or small tree and is mostly found in wetlands. It has clusters of seven to 13 smooth leaves.\n\nMost pets aren’t sensitive to these plants, according to the FDA, but the oil can stick to their fur and transfer to humans. If your pet comes in contact with poison ivy, oak or sumac, give them a bath with gloves on.\n\nMORE:'No other option': How Millsboro bypass will affect rare, threatened, endangered species\n\nPoison hemlock and spotted water hemlock\n\nBoth poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock look similar to the very common Queen Anne’s Lace, or wild carrot.\n\nAn easy way to tell them apart: wild carrot has a hairy stem, while hemlock stems are smooth. Both have “small white flowers in umbrella-like groupings,” according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\n“Foragers who eat wild carrot have to be careful, but they usually know what they’re doing,” Valencik said. “They’re toxic to pets, too.”\n\nPoison hemlock is an invasive plant that grows to between 6 and 8 feet tall. The stems can have purple blotches and the leaves are dark glossy green, fernlike, triangular and lacey, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\n“We’re seeing poison hemlock quite a bit this year,” Valencik said. “It’s widespread throughout the state. It’s usually near water, but it can be found in garden beds if a seed happens to blow in.”\n\nPoison hemlock can also be found in ditches and meadows. It is important to keep it out of areas where livestock feed.\n\nMORE:How Wilmington is trying to leverage the power of trees in its effort to fight crime\n\nSpotted water hemlock is a native plant, almost always found in wetlands or growing along a body of water. It grows up to 6 feet tall, and the stems can be green, purple or both. Its leaves are also lacey and fernlike. Some people say spotted water hemlock has a musty smell, according to Valencik.\n\nRemoving poisonous plants\n\nWhen it comes to your yard, you can always glove up, carefully pull plants from the ground and put them in the trash can.\n\n“It’s always a good idea to wear gloves while weeding,” Valencik said.\n\nIf you’re particularly sensitive to poisonous plants, there's no shame in leaving the job to someone else.\n\nINSECTS:Feel something crawling on your back? You don't want it to be one of these 6 bugs.\n\nHerbicide is another option, but plants that grow along bodies of water, like spotted water hemlock, must be removed by a licensed professional using aquatic-approved products.\n\nDo not burn or mow poisonous plants. The toxins will be released into the air and can affect anyone nearby.\n\nIf you suspect you’ve found poison or spotted water hemlock, you can take a picture and email it to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification.\n\nIn cases of possible ingestion or inhalation of toxins, call 911 immediately.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/30/what-kind-snakes-delaware-guide-to-identify/7658298001/", "title": "What kind of snakes are in Delaware: Guide", "text": "Danger noodles. Nope ropes. Spicy pasta.\n\nHumanity’s primal fear of snakes reigns even in the meme age. They’re slithery, slimy and sneaky and can induce fear in even the bravest of today’s keyboard warriors.\n\nDelaware is home to 19 species of snakes, according to state herpetologist Nate Nazdrowicz, and the truth is, they're mostly harmless.\n\n“Many snakes prey on other species that we would consider pests so it’s beneficial to have them around,” Nazdrowicz said. “Several snakes feed on rodents that might tear up your lawn. Some feed on slugs that will eat your garden plants.”\n\nAs part of the food web, they’re also food themselves for species like hawks and owls.\n\n“If you’re not afraid of them, the best thing to do is just leave them be,” Nazdrowicz said.\n\nREPTILES:How 2 Delaware high school seniors are making their mark in turtle conservation\n\nBut many people, if not most, are afraid of snakes. If you’re one of them, Nazdrowicz has some recommendations for you.\n\n“Snakes are found in areas that provide food, shelter and areas where they find it easy to regulate their body temperatures. If you have noticed a snake hanging around your house, then your yard is likely providing these resources for the snake,” he said.\n\nTo keep snakes out of your yard, make it less attractive to them and the species they eat. Mow frequently and keep flower beds neat. Don’t allow leaves to collect or pile sticks. Don’t feed pets or store birdseed outside. Don’t use rocks in landscaping.\n\n“Snakes are less likely to move through low grass or sparsely vegetated areas because they feel exposed to avian predators,” Nazdrowicz said.\n\nPLANTS:5 poisonous plants to avoid in Delaware this summer, from poison ivy to spotted water hemlock\n\nIf you encounter a snake and feel the need to force it to move along, you can do so safely with a garden hose, Nazdrowicz said.\n\nIf you're bitten by a snake, try to take a picture of it so it can be positively identified. Bites from Delaware's only venomous snake, the eastern copperhead, are uncommon, according to Nazdrowicz. Death from such bites is even rarer, but if you are bitten by a copperhead, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nSnakes of Delaware\n\nYou’ll likely only ever see four of Delaware’s 19 species of snakes; the eastern rat snake, black racer, common garter snake and common watersnake.\n\nThe rest are rarely seen, for a variety of reasons. They’re secretive, burrowers, just plain tiny or all of the above.\n\nDELAWARE:How dire is plight of Bethany Beach firefly amid Sussex County development?\n\nThree of them — the plain-bellied watersnake, scarletsnake and red cornsnake — are endangered. Five others are considered critically imperiled, including Delaware’s only venomous snake: the eastern copperhead.\n\nUsing some information from the Virginia Herpetological Society, here is a little about each snake and how to identify them. It’s important to keep in mind that juvenile snakes can look vastly different from adults.\n\nSNAKES:Biologists catch record-breaking 215-pound Burmese python in Florida Everglades\n\nEastern garter snake\n\nThe common garter snake is on the small side, growing to about 2.5 feet. Adults are brownish-green with a black checkerboard pattern and usually have a yellowish stripe down their back center. They’re found in a variety of habitats and feed on frogs, fish and slugs.\n\nBlack rat snake\n\nAs an adult, the eastern black rat snake will grow to be about 5 feet long. It’s black with white on its belly and around its mouth. These skilled climbers eat mainly small warm-blooded animals, such as mice and birds, as well as bird eggs. They live in many different habitats.\n\nWhen feeling threatened, they may take a striking position and vibrate their tails, like a rattlesnake.\n\nNorthern black racer\n\nBlack racers and rat snakes are often confused. They are similar in size and color and also live in a variety of habitats, but the racer has smooth scales, while rat snakes’ are more textured. Racers also eat small mammals, as well as frogs and even other snakes. They are very fast, as their name suggests.\n\nCommon watersnake\n\nMost common watersnakes grow to about 3 feet long and have black, white and reddish-brown crossbands. As their name suggests, they are usually found near water – mainly freshwater but sometimes brackish. They eat mostly fish and frogs.\n\nDekay's Brownsnake\n\nDeKay’s brownsnakes are usually only about 1 foot long. They vary in color from gray to brown and have paired black spots. They’re easily confused with garters.\n\nDekay’s brownsnakes are nocturnal and not often seen. They’re found in a variety of habitats under logs, rocks or other debris, and eat mainly slugs and earthworms.\n\nPlain-bellied watersnake\n\nPlain-bellied watersnakes are brownish with orangey undersides and can reach lengths of 5 feet. Their habitats and diets are similar to those of the common watersnake. They are endangered in Delaware.\n\nScarletsnake\n\nEndangered scarletsnakes grow to between 14 and 20 inches. Often confused with milksnakes, scarletsnakes have red blotches outlined in black with a cream color in between. They are burrowers, found in sandy, loose soil, usually among pine trees. They eat a variety of small reptiles, mammals and insects, but prefer reptile eggs.\n\nEastern copperhead\n\nThe eastern copperhead is Delaware’s only venomous snake. People confuse all kinds of snakes for copperheads, especially juvenile rat snakes, hog-nosed snakes and watersnakes.\n\nThis species has vertical pupils, like a cat. It’s tan in color with hourglass-shaped crossbands of varying shades of brown.\n\nAccording to Nazdrowicz, copperheads are only found in southern Sussex County and near Wilmington in Delaware.\n\nCommon wormsnake\n\nThe secretive wormsnake grows to be about 1 foot long. They’re uniformly brown with pinkish bellies. They’re found in a variety of habitats, usually under surface debris, logs or rocks, and eat mainly worms.\n\nEastern milksnake\n\nEastern milksnakes have reddish blotches outlined in black, with a cream color in between, and usually grow to be about 3 feet long. They’re another secretive burrower, eating mostly small mammals.\n\nEastern kingsnake\n\nEastern kingsnakes are black with thin white crossbars and usually about 4 feet long. They live in a variety of other habitats and are known for eating other snakes, though they also eat a variety of other prey.\n\nEastern hog-nosed snake\n\nHog-nosed snakes vary greatly in color, from all black to crossbanded with black, brown, orange, red and gray tones. They are best identified by their turned-up snout. They can grow to between 3 and 4 feet long. Hog-nosed snakes are found in a variety of sandy-soil habitats and eat mostly toads. If approached, they may take a striking position, inflate and hiss, or even feign death.\n\nRing-necked snake\n\nRing-necked snakes are usually about 1 foot long. Color ranges from blueish black to gray to brown, with a yellow or cream-colored “ring” around the neck. They inhabit forest surface debris, eating worms, salamanders and skinks.\n\nSmooth earthsnake\n\nSmooth earthsnakes are uniformly reddish-brown to dark gray, often with tiny black flecks. They eat mainly worms and are found in a variety of habitats, mainly underground or under surface debris.\n\nQueensnake\n\nQueensnakes are on the smaller side, reaching a maximum length of 3 feet. Their color ranges from gray to brown to olive green, with two cream-colored or yellowish stripes and sometimes several other dark stripes running their lengths. They’re often confused with garters. Queensnakes are usually found along shallow, rocky streams and eat crayfish almost exclusively.\n\nRough greensnake\n\nRough greensnakes grow to be 2-to-3 feet long. They live in trees in a variety of habitats and eat mainly insects.\n\nCommon ribbonsnake\n\nCommon ribbonsnakes are dark brown or black with three yellow or cream-colored stripes down their length. They can grow to about 2 feet. They are semiaquatic and can be found in many habitats near water, often in trees. They eat mainly frogs, salamanders and small fish.\n\nRed-bellied snake\n\nThe red-bellied snake is usually only between eight and 10 inches long. It can be gray, brown or black and has two or four dark stripes. Like Dekay’s brownsnake, the red-bellied snake is nocturnal and can be found in multiple habitats, often under logs, rocks or other debris. They eat slugs almost exclusively.\n\nRed cornsnake\n\nRed cornsnakes can grow to about 4 feet long. They have reddish-brown blotches outlined in black with tan in between. This secretive snake lives in forests and eats mostly rodents.\n\nMORE:In the market for a new home?

They enjoy feasting on tiny crustaceans, plankton and small fish, and live at the surface of the ocean and in shallow coastline waters.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide, about 12,000 of which live in the Atlantic Ocean. The agency declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2016 after an unusual number of whales were found dead or stranded on East Coast beaches. To date, 79 humpback whales have washed ashore from Florida to Maine as part of that mortality event.\n\nFun fact: Humpback whales can live about 80 to 90 years in the wild, and are known to migrate 5,000 miles per year.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale\n\nKnown as one of the rarest whale species in the world, the North Atlantic right whale can reach about 50 feet in length and weigh up to 140,000 pounds. They also feast on tiny marine life, largely zooplankton. While they were once found in all of the world’s oceans, they now mainly live in the North Atlantic.\n\nNOAA estimates there are fewer than 500 right whales left, making the species critically endangered. The agency declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2017 when 17 whales were found dead in Canada and the United States.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales threatened by climate change and human encounters\n\nFun fact: A characteristic feature of this species is the raised patches of rough skin on their heads, called callosities, which appear white because of whale lice.\n\nMinke whale\n\nThis uniquely shaped whale can reach about 35 feet in length and weigh up to 20,000 pounds. It is another species known to breach the ocean’s surface and delight those lucky enough to be nearby. They feed on small marine animals, such as crustaceans, plankton and small fish and are largely found in temperate or cool waters.\n\nNOAA estimates there is a robust population of minke whales in the world, with about 2,500 living in the Atlantic. The agency also declared an unusual mortality event for this whale species in 2017, and since then, 37 whales have been found dead or stranded on beaches from South Carolina to Maine.\n\nFun fact: Minke whales are the smallest of baleen whales, which are whales that have plates of whalebone in their mouths to strain plankton from the water.\n\nPilot whales\n\nBoth short-finned and long-finned pilot whales are known to frequent Delaware’s coast, following and feasting on squid. Short-finned pilot whales can reach up to 24 feet and weigh up to 6,600 pounds, while long-finned whales can reach 25 feet and about 5,000 pounds.\n\nNOAA estimates there are about 1,100 short-finned whales in the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Atlantic Ocean, while more than 8,000 long-finned whales are estimated to live in the Atlantic and 200,000 in the Antarctic.\n\nFun fact: Long-finned pilot whales can dive 2,000 feet deep for about 15 minutes to feed.\n\nSperm whale\n\nThe sperm whale and its smaller relative, the pygmy sperm whale, can be found worldwide, and live year-round in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Georges Bank.\n\nSperm whales can reach up to 52 feet in length and weigh up to 90,000 pounds. The smaller pygmy version reaches a maximum of about 12 feet and up to 1,000 pounds. Both enjoy feasting on squid, but are also known to hunt other fish. Pygmy sperm whales also enjoy the occasional crustacean.\n\nSperm whales enjoy deeper waters and are considered endangered, with an estimate of 450,000 left in worldwide waters. It is unclear how many pygmy sperm whales are left, but NOAA estimates there are about 1,000 in the Atlantic and in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFun fact: Sperm whales are named after a waxy substance found on their heads, which is called spermaceti. That substance was historically used for oil lamps, lubricants and candles.\n\nSei whale\n\nThis sleek swimmer can reach up to 60 feet in length and weigh up to 100,000 pounds. They usually live in deeper waters, but will follow their prey — which includes plankton and small crustaceans — into inshore waters.\n\nThey are considered endangered, and NOAA estimates there are about 8,600 sei whales in the northern Pacific Ocean, but it is unclear how many remain in other waters.\n\nFun fact: Sei whales can swim at speeds of 34 miles per hour or faster, and eat about 2,000 pounds of food per day.\n\nFin whale\n\nAs the largest whale species known to frequent Delaware’s coast, fin whales can reach up to 85 feet in length and weigh up to 160,000 pounds. They are known to be fast swimmers, and are usually found in deep, offshore waters around the world.\n\nFin whales are considered endangered, and NOAA estimates there are about 2,700 left in the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, about 3,200 in the eastern Pacific Ocean and a total of about 82,000 worldwide.\n\nFun fact: Fin whales sometimes mate with blue whales, and hybrids have been documented.\n\nOrca\n\nCommonly known as killer whales, orcas can reach up to 32 feet in length and weigh up to 22,000 pounds. They eat everything from fish and squid to birds, turtles and other marine mammals.\n\nThis species is considered uncommon and found worldwide. NOAA estimates there are fewer than 300 orcas in the Gulf of Mexico, but their population off the East Coast is largely unknown. It is estimated there are about 50,000 worldwide.\n\nFun fact: The killer whale, or orca, is the largest member of the Delphinidae family, which are oceanic dolphins. Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales also belong to this family.\n\nIf you see a whale\n\nOccasionally, large whales wash ashore on Delaware’s beaches, where they can create quite a stir. Marine stranding experts advise people and pets to keep their distance, because the stranded whale — dead or alive — could carry diseases.\n\nAnyone who sees a whale in distress in the water or on the shore should immediately call the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute’s 24-hour hotline at (302) 228-5029.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nSOUTHERN DELAWARE NEWS\n\nAs Delaware coastal waters warm, risk of deadly bacteria rises\n\nCape Henlopen shows 'lack of urgency' in hiring more minority teachers, group says\n\nDogs surrendered by Georgetown backyard breeder ready for adoption at local SPCA", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/03/poisonous-hemlock-species-found-recently-sussex-county-delaware-department-of-agriculture-animals/7851456002/", "title": "Poison hemlock species found recently in Sussex County can be ...", "text": "A hemlock that may be mistaken for a wild carrot, parsnip or celery could cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and, in extreme cases, even death.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Agriculture is warning Delawareans about two species of hemlock recently found in Sussex County. Scientists confirmed the presence of poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock. All parts of the plants – leaves, stems, flowers and roots – are poisonous to humans and animals.\n\nBoth were found in wetland areas in Sussex County.\n\nPeople who like to forage for food or cut wildflowers are advised to avoid wild carrot-looking plants to prevent the possibility of being poisoned.\n\nTORNADOES: Weather service, after surveying damage, says two tornadoes hit Delaware Thursday\n\nPoison hemlock, an invasive biennial native to Europe, northern Africa and western Asia, grows from 6 to 8 feet tall. It is also known to grow in ditches, meadows, pastures and the edges of cultivated fields. The plant emits an odor, but people should not crush any part of the plant to smell it because toxic alkaline oils can be released, poisoning the person, the Department of Agriculture said.\n\nSpotted water hemlock is a native plant that grows up to 6 feet tall. The stems can vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, the Department of Agriculture said. The leaves are lacy and fernlike, with veins ending at the base of the notch of the leaf edge.\n\nIf residents suspect they have found either of these plants, take a picture and email it to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification.\n\nDepending on the exposure – direct contact, ingestion and inhalation – signs and symptoms of poisoning by spotted water hemlock and poison hemlock in humans can appear as soon as 15 minutes to hours and can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, irregular heartbeat, dilation of the pupils, respiratory distress, muscle damage, renal failure and central nervous system involvement causing seizures, with potential for death, the Department of Agriculture said.\n\nHOLIDAY WEEKEND: How to get around the Delaware beaches during Fourth of July road closures, delays\n\nIf you think you've been exposed, call the Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222 or 911.\n\nToxicity can occur in animals if any part of the plant is ingested. Ingestion of the plant may lead to death within just two to three hours, depending on the amount consumed. Fresh leaves of poison hemlock are not pleasant to animals, so livestock and horses rarely eat hemlock if other feed is available, the Department of Agriculture said.\n\nClinical signs in livestock usually begin within 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion. There is no treatment or cure. When ingested, the toxin affects nerve impulse transmission to the muscles, and animals die due to respiratory failure. Animals often will be found dead before the illness is determined.\n\nContact reporter Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.

CDC confirms one was found in ...", "text": "WILMINGTON, Del. – The \"kissing bug\" – which bites people around their mouth and can pass along the fatal disease Chagas – is making its way north.\n\nIn September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the deadly bloodsuckers were on the move up from Central and South America and had been reported in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\nLast week the CDC confirmed an actual sighting in Delaware.\n\nIn July, a family from Kent County called the Delaware Division of Public Health and Delaware Department of Agriculture because an insect had bitten their child's face while she was watching TV in her bedroom.\n\nThe family lived in an older single-family home near a heavily wooded area, according to a CDC report. There was an air conditioner in the window of the girl's bedroom and the family hadn't traveled anywhere outside the local area.\n\nStaff from the agriculture department preliminarily identified the insect as Triatoma sanguisuga, or the kissing bug.\n\nWant news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp? Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nThey sent pictures of the insect to Texas A&M University’s Kissing Bug Citizen Science Program, a multidisciplinary research program aimed at documenting and collecting kissing bugs from across the United States.\n\nMore:Insidious 'kissing bugs' bite Texas woman\n\nThe insect also was sent to the CDC, which did tests and confirmed their findings.\n\nThe girl who was bitten did not get sick, though the bugs can carry a deadly disease known as Chagas.\n\nThe silent danger\n\nDoctors say the kissing bug is a silent killer.\n\nWhile it sucks your blood, it defecates. In its feces is a parasite, which finds a home in your tissue, muscles and heart and leads to Chagas disease.\n\nThe disease can be fatal, though the chances of contracting it are low.\n\nIf a person contracts the disease, symptoms typically include severe redness, itching, swelling, welts and hives, CDC officials say. It can be spread from mother to baby, by blood transfusion and during organ transplants.\n\nMost people only experience minor symptoms. But some, less than half, may develop the following:\n\nIrregular heartbeats that can cause sudden death.\n\nAn enlarged heart that doesn't pump blood well.\n\nProblems with digestion and bowel movement.\n\nAn increased chance of having a stroke.\n\nThe CDC estimates that approximately 300,000 persons with Chagas disease live in the United States, and most were infected with the parasite T. cruzi in parts of Latin America where Chagas disease is found.\n\nOnly a few cases of Chagas disease caused by contact with the bugs have been documented in the United States.\n\nFor more information, go to www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas or call 404-718-4745.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nYou can take precautions against the kissing bug. The CDC recommends locating outdoor lights away from dwellings such as homes, dog kennels and chicken coops and turning off lights that are not in use.\n\nHomeowners also should remove trash, wood, and rock piles from around the home and clear out any bird and animal nests.\n\nCracks and gaps around windows, air conditioners, walls, roofs, doors and crawl spaces into the house should be inspected and sealed.\n\nChimney flues should be tightly closed when not in use and screens should be used on all doors and windows. Ideally, pets should sleep indoors, especially at night, and outdoor pet resting areas kept clean.\n\nIf you suspect you have Chagas disease, consult your health care provider.\n\nHow to tell if it's a kissing bug\n\nAdult kissing bugs range from about 0.75 to 1.25 inches in length. Most species have a very characteristic band around the edge of the body that is striped with orange or red markings.\n\nOne species (Triatoma protracta) may or may not have a single colored band around the outer edge of the body.\n\nThe legs of kissing bugs are long and thin. Unlike some other species, the legs are uniformly thin along the length of the leg, and there are no \"bulging\" thicker areas.\n\nKissing bugs have distinctive mouthparts that appear as a large black extension to the head. These mouthparts give rise to the nickname \"cone-nose bug.'\n\nThere are 11 different species of kissing bugs in the United States. The most common species in the south-central United States are Triatoma sanguisuga and Triatoma gerstaeckeri, which are each about 1 inch long.\n\nFollow Jessica Bies on Twitter: @jessicajbies.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/06/07/ticks-mosquitoes-chiggers-delmarva/85499732/", "title": "Delmarva's plentiful insects can be annoying, dangerous", "text": "HARRISON JACKSON\n\nCOLUMNIST\n\nWarm weather means shorts, T-shirts, tank tops and flip flops, but it also means ticks, chiggers and mosquitoes here on the Eastern Shore.

Ticks are small and dark, often black or brown colored and only about 1/8 of an inch long before attachment, which is why they are so difficult to find when they are on your body.\n\nThese tick species prefer slightly different habitats; however, the brown dog tick tends to survive the best of all these species indoors, but suffers outside in woody areas.\n\nThe American dog tick, deer tick and lone star tick are often found in wooded areas or fields with tall grass, anywhere there might be high traffic for larger mammals such as deer, foxes, dogs or people to latch onto.\n\nTicks will attach themselves to a host and travel around the body in search of a preferable feeding spot, like the back of a knee, the back of the head or around the armpits, where they will insert their mouth parts into the skin and begin sucking out the host's blood. If not found and removed, adult ticks can feed on a host for days, until becoming engorged and several times larger than their original size.\n\nFIND OUT MORE: Ticks on Delmarva\n\nAbout 59 species of mosquitoes live in Maryland, each uniquely suited for the wide array of habitats they inhabit. Mosquito species are locally abundant, which means they have high populations in small areas or habitats; however, there tends to be little overlap in species habitat.\n\nMosquitoes belong to the order Diptera, or “true flies.” All species must spend some portion of life in water, mostly for the larval and pupal stages. When adult mosquitoes first emerge from their aquatic stages, they mate. Then the female goes off to find blood to provide protein for her fertilized eggs, which she then lays in a moist area or in water.\n\nWhile there are both male and female mosquitoes, only the females bite, as only females have the proboscis necessary to suck blood. Male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and lack the mouth parts necessary to break human skin.\n\nTo repel Delmarva pests, try taking an au naturale route\n\nChiggers are very similar to ticks; however, there are some distinct differences. The chiggers that bite humans and other mammals are the juvenile, or larval, form of a mite of the family Trombiculidae. Chiggers are red mites that are extremely small, less than 1/150 of an inch long, and can really only be seen when they congregate in larger numbers.\n\nLike ticks, chiggers live in vegetated areas, like the woods and open fields, and will attach themselves to large mammals that walk by. These tiny mites will migrate around the skin until they find an optimal feeding area with thinner skin, such as the ankles, behind the knees or armpits.\n\nContrary to popular belief, chiggers do not bury themselves in your skin to feed. Chiggers insert their feeding structures into the skin and inject certain enzymes that cause destruction of host tissue, whether it be human or some other kind of mammal.\n\nHardening of the surrounding skin results in the formation of a feeding tube called a stylostome, which is what causes the severe skin irritation. Chigger larvae then feed upon the destroyed tissue of the host until dislodged, killed or engorged.\n\nWhile all three of these insects feed on larger mammals and humans, only ticks and mosquitoes are true vectors, or carriers, of diseases. Thus far in Maryland, chiggers have yet to be connected with transmittable diseases to humans. However, intense scratching at the infestation site can lead to secondary bacterial infections.\n\nIt is important to be wary of ticks in Maryland, since they are potential vectors for tularemia, Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. All three diseases can be found in Maryland; however, Lyme disease is the most prevalent.\n\nMosquitoes are vectors for several diseases as well including malaria, yellow fever and West Nile virus. Only West Nile virus has been known to occur in Maryland.\n\nThere are several ways to help prevent getting bitten by one of these troublesome insects. The best way is to wear long clothing, like pants and long sleeved shirts, when traveling in woody areas or open fields, as this will help to keep ticks and chiggers from attaching themselves to your skin while outside.\n\nBug and insect repellants are also useful, as these will help to keep mosquitoes away as well as other insects, such as horseflies or gnats.\n\nPreventative measures may not be enough, so after a day outdoors everyone should give themselves a full body tick and chigger check to see if they have any unwanted hitchhikers.\n\nHarrison Jackson is the former education coordinator for Maryland Coastal Bays Program.\n\nFor Lyme patients, finding care is a challenge", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/07"}]}

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We’re glad we can make our GasCard permanent while others are ending their assistance programs.”\n\nBite Squad operates an online ordering technology platform, providing delivery, carryout and dine-in options. Bite Squad connects local restaurants and grocery stores to diners in underserved U.S. markets. It is a convenient way to discover, order and receive great food and other products from local restaurants, national chains and grocery stores.

We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing?

Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

He said his government had a special focus on helping disadvantaged and low-income communities that have often been overlooked.\n\n“Folks this is about safety, but it’s also about fairness,” he said. “We have to make things right, and we’re going to do that now.”\n\nWithout mentioning Donald Trump by name, referring to him as his “predecessor” several times, Biden said his administration was making progress for all Americans – not just the wealthy and corporations.\n\n“I’m sick and tired of trickle-down economics,” he said to loud applause.\n\nAlong with brandishing his environmental credentials, Biden mentioned his work in helping the economy – especially manufacturing – bounce back from the pandemic and foreign competition.\n\nHe took special note of his administration's work on reducing medical and prescription costs, something he said he had been working on for decades while in the U.S. Senate.\n\n“I know I look like I’m only 40, but I’m a little older than that,” Biden said, taking a self-deprecating jab at the age issue that has dogged him during his re-election push.\n\nThe president wrapped up his comments just after 5:22 p.m.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nShow the president 'our Wilmington'\n\nWilmington Mayor Bill Saffo took the stage at 4:40 p.m., warming up the crowd.\n\nHe talked up the sense of community and how peoplepower can make a difference in good governance and protecting the environment.\n\nSaffo was followed by EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who used to be the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n“It is great to be home back in North Carolina,” Regan said, before mentioning the new PFAS regulations he had announced in Fayetteville last month.\n\nHe then said President Biden is keeping his promises and working “every single day” for a healthier and fairer America.\n\nRegan also praised Saffo and local advocates for staring down the water quality issues the Cape Fear region had been facing for years.\n\nThat journey would be continued today by the president’s announcement to dedicate billions toward the removal of lead pipes from the nation’s water systems.\n\nNext up was Gov. Roy Cooper, who received the first standing ovation of the afternoon.\n\n“I’m excited and always excited to be at the beach,” he said after remarking that this was the president’s third visit in four months to North Carolina.\n\n“And with him being from Delaware, we want to show him our Wilmington,\" he said to thunderous applause. \"If Air Force One's crew ever gets confused about which Wilmington to fly to, tell them to head south!\"\n\nNext up is President Biden, who started his remarks remembering the law enforcement officers' lives lost in Charlotte on Monday.\n\nAfterwards, Biden noted to Saffo that there's another Wilmington: The one the President knows well in Delaware.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nBiden reaches Wilmington Convention Center\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrived at Wilmington International Airport’s Aero Center and was greeted by Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo and Governor Roy Cooper at 4:20 p.m.\n\nSaffo joined the motorcade and they departed to travel to the Wilmington Convention Center where Biden is expected to deliver his remarks. Around 20 minutes later, the motorcade arrived.\n\nRemarks will include environmental investments such as the replacement of 1.7 million toxic lead pipes throughout the U.S.\n\nBiden will also meet with local students and faculty from a Wilmington school that was able to replace a water fountain with high levels of lead with funding from the president’s American Rescue Plan.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nBiden arrives...and so do Donald Trump supporters\n\nAir Force One made its way to Wilmington International Airport around 4:15 p.m.\n\nWhile it might be around 5 p.m. before President Joe Biden arrives at the Wilmington Convention Center, a few supporters of former President Donald Trump will also be there to greet him.\n\nBy 3:30 p.m., dozens of civilians gathered about a block away from the convention center. Among them were about 40 pro-Palestinian activists and roughly the same number of supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump’s supporters raised flags with “Trump 2024” and “Women for Trump” messages, among others.The crowd of activists held signs and yelled “Free, free, free Palestine,” “Cease fire now,” “Biden, Biden, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide,” among other chants.\n\n-- Jamey Cross\n\nDistrict Attorney on Biden: 'He's putting his money where his mouth is'\n\nNew Hanover and Pender County District Attorney Ben David said Wilmington \"will always be a place where the biggest races are decided\" as he awaited President Joe Biden's arrival at the Wilmington Convention Center Thursday afternoon. \"Politically we are a microcosm, we represent what America looks like and we are confronting some of the biggest issues honestly here, and so, it's only appropriate that (Biden) should come to Wilmington.\"\n\nPrior to his arrival in Wilmington, Biden is making a stop in Charlotte to meet with the families of law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty.\n\nDavid said he appreciates that the president \"recognizes the importance of going to a tragedy like that and calling out the violence that has to stop.\" Addressing such violence is important, \"particularly when it's directed at people who are just trying to do their jobs,\" David added.\n\nThe district attorney said he admires that the president has come to North Carolina to address three important topics: honoring men and women in law enforcement, the environment, and infrastructure.\n\n\"He's putting his money where his mouth is,\" David said about Biden.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nWhite House remarks before flight to Wilmington\n\nPress Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration mourns “for the fallen heroes and their loved ones and (prays) for the recoveries of the courageous officers who were wounded” while en route to Charlotte, according to a press release.\n\nJean-Pierre also touched on the upcoming presidential visit to Wilmington. While the schedule noted Joe Biden's arrival to the Wilmington International Airport around 3:55 p.m., it's more likely Air Force One will arrive at 4:15 p.m.\n\n“President Biden believes that every American should be able to turn on the tap and...drink clean and safe water,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nEnviornmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said he was “really excited to join the president today for this big announcement.”\n\n“This is the third installment of five,” Regan said in the release. “We are giving out or investing into grants that will amount to $15 billion in total. This is the third year, so the President has already put out $9 billion to erase these lead service lines in our country.”\n\nThe 100% removal of lead piping across the country is expected to complete within a 10-year window, Regan said in the release, adding that he was unable to provide an estimate on the percentage of lead piping that has already been removed nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nSeats all spoken for\n\nThe first attendees at President Joe Biden’s event at the Wilmington Convention Center began filing in just after 2 p.m.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the small guest area was roughly half full of VIPs, hand-picked by the White House and local Democratic Party for the president’s announcement about new funding to remove lead pipes from homes and public water systems.\n\nWith the president not scheduled to speak for around two hours, many of the attendees took the downtime to excitedly take pictures in front of the dais and lectern that would later be occupied by the country’s top executive – large signs and digital boards behind them advertising Biden’s impending policy announcement.\n\nBy 2:35 p.m., officials announced all the seats were taken and it would now be standing-room only as people continued to file in.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nWomen's groups arrive at convention center\n\nElli Klein, founding administrator of Southeast North Carolina Women for Biden/Harris, arrived at the Wilmington Convention Center around 2:15 p.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm joining my Democratic Party colleagues to hear what the president has to say and all that he is doing (and) all the administration is doing to improve our infrastructure,\" said Klein less than two hours before President Joe Biden is scheduled to give remarks. \"It's exciting. We have a lot of work to do to make sure we preserve our reproductive freedom and our democracy.\"\n\nElaine Syres, core member of Women Organizing for Wilmington (WOW), arrived at the Wilmington Convention Center sporting both a WOW T-shirt and a blue American Federation of Teachers T-shirt.\n\nSyres recalled Women Organizing for Wilmington protests held outside on the corner of City Hall in 2016.\n\n\"The first one I was involved in was (about) the condition of the water in New Hanover County and the PFAS and everything else,\" Syres said. \"What good does it do everybody if the water (that is) going to the homes or schools (is) going through lead pipes? It's an issue...it could be the cleanest water in the world but if you're running it through a lead pipe, that's not helping anyone.\"\n\nBiden \"should come here\" to discuss the replacement of lead pipes, Syres said, adding it's an issue experienced nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nWilmington International Airport to soon see Air Force One\n\nBy early afternoon, President Joe Biden’s expected arrival time at Wilmington International Airport’s Aero Center remains 3:55 p.m.\n\nAbout two hours before Biden’s expected arrival, Wilmington International Airport appears not too busy. Some New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office vehicles and Wilmington Police Department vehicles are in the area.\n\nAccording to the airport’s website, flights for General Aviation users will be restricted between 1:30 p.m.-5:15 p.m.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nBy noon, Wilmington Convention Center relatively quiet\n\nAside from a heavy police presence in the area, things were largely quiet at the Wilmington Convention Center early Thursday afternoon. Several Wilmington Police Department vehicles were in the area, and deputies with the New Hanover County Sheriff's Office were also nearby.\n\nStudents made their way around Cape Fear Community College’s downtown campus Thursday afternoon, where classes were seemingly being held as usual.\n\n-- Jamey Cross\n\nMore on Biden's speech, including a visit with Wilmington students\n\nThe White House released more details about President Joe Biden's expected remarks in Wilmington on Thursday afternoon. He is scheduled to speak at the Wilmington Convention Center at 4:30 p.m.\n\nAccording to a morning news release, Biden is expected to announce a $3 billion investment to replace toxic lead pipes during his Wilmington presidential visit. Biden’s announcement “delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs,” the release reads. It added $76 million in funding from the president’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be allocated to lead pipe replacement across North Carolina.\n\nBiden is expected to meet with faculty and students from a Wilmington school that replaced a water fountain with high levels of lead with funding from the president’s American Rescue Plan, according to the release. The total project will replace up to 1.7 million lead pipes nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nBiden heads to Charlotte, then Wilmington\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be visiting Wilmington today to talk about address environmental issues and infrastructure in the city and surrounding region.\n\nAfter departing Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Air Force One around 11:45 a.m., his first stop will be in Charlotte to pay respects and meet family members of four law enforcement officers who died on Monday in a shootout.\n\nBiden will leave Charlotte at 3:10 p.m. and should arrive at Wilmington International Airport around 3:55. Then he will head to the Wilmington Convention Center, where he will discuss his Investing in America agenda and how it is rebuilding infrastructure and creating jobs in Wilmington and across the country, according to an email announcement from the White House.\n\nBiden in Wilmington:From arrival to traffic, here's more about the president's visit\n\nAlthough Biden is seeking reelection in November, his visit is not a campaign visit, but a presidential visit.\n\n\"It cannot come at a more-critical time during a more-critical election year in a more-critical place,\" according to a statement Monday from the New Hanover County Democratic Party.\n\nBiden's visit comes nearly two weeks after Donald Trump's campaign rally in Wilmington was postponed due to severe weather. A date has not been set yet for his return.\n\nAs for the issues Biden could be addressing, it is uncertain which ones he will cover, but PFAS filtration could be one on the list as well as the need for a Cape Fear Memorial Bridge replacement.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nCheck back here for updates throughout the day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/02/12/climate-protesters-detained-president-joe-biden-campaign-headquarters-in-wilmington-delaware/72570262007/", "title": "Protesters arrested after entering Biden campaign HQ in Wilmington ...", "text": "Nearly two-dozen people who entered the Wilmington building where President Joe Biden's 2024 campaign headquarters are housed were led away in handcuffs during a Monday morning protest, according to city police and the group organizing the demonstration.\n\nThe protest, which brought together about 100 people, was organized by Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate-focused group. They demanded an end to the use of fossil fuels and called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWhile many participants remained outside the Brandywine Building on North West Street, at least two dozen entered and made their way up to the eighth floor.\n\nThey could be seen being taken away in plastic handcuffs by Wilmington officers, who were both inside and outside the building.\n\n\"Expect more from us,\" said Ariela Lara, an organizer who traveled from Bay City, California, to protest.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhy was the protest held?\n\nAccording to Sunrise, the protest was organized after months of campaigning. The organization is \"targeting both Republicans and Democrats ahead of the 2024 election,\" a news release said.\n\nLast month, protesters \"disrupted dozens of GOP Presidential candidates’ events in Iowa and New Hampshire,\" according to the release. In December, the organization delivered a petition to Biden with 48,000 signatures \"calling on him to act on Sunrise’s campaign demands.\"\n\nYet the president has fulfilled several of Sunrise’s key requests, including pausing all approvals of permits to export liquefied natural gas. During this pause, the administration \"will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy costs, America’s energy security, and our environment,” Biden said.\n\nLast year, Biden also established the American Climate Corps, which Sunrise praised in a September post on X, formerly known as Twitter. The corps, according to the White House, is an \"initiative to train young people in high-demand skills for jobs in the clean energy economy.\"\n\nStill, Lara said she attended Monday's protest because her community is \"enduring severe storms, homes are being flooded (and) power outages are lasting weeks.\"\n\n\"When fires come to California, we're breathing in toxic air,\" she said. \"I'm here because my community is suffering. I'm here because I want a livable future and Biden needs to declare a climate emergency.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old also claimed Biden is funding the killing of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"Instead of taking action on climate, he is spending his time setting bombs in Gaza,\" Lara said.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt pushed back on the claims, saying the president \"secured the single largest climate investment in history, which puts the U.S. on a path to cut climate pollution in half by 2030.\"\n\n\"President Biden is working hard to finish the job, while Donald Trump has promised to undo all the progress we've made,\" Hitt added. \"As president, Trump called climate change a 'hoax' and slashed critical environmental protections.\"\n\nBiden, who has long supported Israel, has also criticized the country for some of its actions in the war against Hamas, last week saying its military actions in Gaza were “over the top,” the New York Times reported.\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that some of the president’s aides are urging him to be even more critical of Israel Defense Forces operations.\n\nWhat were protesters charged with?\n\nA Wilmington police spokesperson said officers were called to the building a little before 9:45 a.m. \"in reference to a large group of subjects who were trespassing and acting disorderly inside of the building.\"\n\nBuilding management and security personnel told responding officers that the protesters were trespassing and had refused to leave.\n\nWhen asked, Wilmington Police Department spokesman David Karas said the department could not answer how the activists got past building security, as it is a private facility. He added the question should be directed to the building's security or management.\n\nBPGS, the construction management company in charge of the building, did not immediately respond to the question about the breach.\n\nBut Stevie O'Hanlon, a Sunrise communications director, said protestors entered the building and security allowed them to get onto the elevators.\n\nWilmington police said while some protestors left when officers arrived, others \"continued to refuse instructions to leave the building.\"\n\nPolice detained 21 \"adult subjects,\" who will be charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct.\n\nBy about 11:15 a.m., members of the group said they were taking a short break but planned to be outside all day. Many donned black shirts that read \"Declare a climate emergency,\" while others held bright yellow signs with the same words.\n\nOther signs read \"Fund climate change, not genocide.\"\n\nAs of 4:45 p.m., the group had made good on its promise to continue demonstrating. While their numbers had dwindled some, a chunk of the original 100 or so protestors remained.\n\nGot a tip? Send to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2785.

Here's why", "text": "Delaware is a tiny state. The joke is there are no degrees of separation.\n\nWe always ask people where they went to high school because we know that's where we'll find our Delaware connection. And we usually do.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son Beau was a few years younger than I was. We didn't go to the same schools in Delaware, but we knew some of the same people. Our paths crossed every once in a while, especially when he was attorney general. That's just Delaware.\n\nBack in 2002, I was assigned to write a feature story on a guy who had decided to become a politician. I had to follow this guy around to many events. While I had covered the late Sen. Bill Roth's last campaign, I was struggling with this assignment.\n\nThe man's rival wasn't too happy at the attention her opponent was receiving and chewed me out at an event. I sat on a bench at Highlands Elementary School in Wilmington, alone, sifting through my notes with a deadline looming. A waiting, anxious new editor wanted a piece \"that sang\" and I had a sinking feeling: What the heck was I going to write?\n\nI'm sure the despair showed in my face. Then I heard a friendly voice say, \"Hey, how are you? Are you OK?\"\n\nI looked up and it was Beau standing over me, holding out his hand. He introduced himself (but I already knew who he was), and we shook hands and made small talk.\n\nHe wasn't in office at the time. He was just being kind. It wasn't a grand gesture, just a small one, but somehow, it made a difference that day. I never forgot that act of kindness.\n\nThat's one reason I stood in line for hours in 2015 with thousands of other Delawareans at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Wilmington to pay respects to the Biden family. It was a public viewing for Beau, who died of cancer.\n\nINAUGURATION TIMELINE:How President Biden, Delaware took in celebration\n\nThe News Journal was the only media allowed at an after-funeral gathering at the patio of Archmere Academy for Beau's closest friends. Photographer Jason Minto and I were the only journalists there, and we heard stories from his friends and saw never-before-made-public photos. It wasn't hard to tell how much he was beloved.\n\nOn Tuesday, at Joe Biden's sendoff in Delaware, it struck me that the president-elect was leaving to become the 46th president, not from the Wilmington train station that bears his name, but from the Delaware National Guard Center near New Castle named for Beau, who died at age 46.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN:Longtime Delaware leader now takes nation’s helm\n\nJoe had tears in his eyes when he said Beau should have been the one to become president. I lost a very close family member two years ago this month, and I can understand his continued grief.\n\nLong story short, I was thinking of Beau on Wednesday when I was sent out on assignment to see how or even if Delaware was celebrating this historic presidential moment for our state.\n\nAs I drove into Greenville, I thought I would drive by Beau's grave and say a short prayer outside of St. Joseph on the Brandywine, a Catholic church where I have attended Mass not far from my house.\n\nFAMILY BIBLE ORIGIN STORY:The story behind the Biden family Bible\n\nI saw a lone person in a blue uniform kneeling at Beau's grave. No one else was around on this cold, windy afternoon except for a few people doing outside work at the cemetery. In my car, I had the radio tuned to CNN. Joe Biden was being sworn in as president and was about to begin his address.\n\nThe person in the uniform bowed their head and clasped their hands. The image brought tears to my eyes.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to interrupt this poignant, solemn moment. I took some photos from a distance and pulled my car over to a nearby roadway. I listened to the end of Biden's speech and drove back to see if the person was still there. The person was. And the person was still kneeling, still had their head bowed.\n\nBEAU AND THE VICE PRESIDENT:Beau Biden had VP Harris' back during trouble\n\nThe journalist in me wanted to go back and find out the person's identity and ask why they were there. The person who once received a kind gesture from Beau when I needed it most knew it was a time to be respectful, and I drove away.\n\nSome things in life you just let be.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/17/joe-biden-motorcade-wilmington-delaware-security-breach/71955362007/", "title": "Car slams into parked SUV protecting Joe Biden's motorcade in ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — A car plowed into a parked SUV that was shielding President Joe Biden’s motorcade while the president and first lady Jill Biden were exiting his campaign headquarters in Delaware on Sunday night.\n\nNeither the president nor the first lady was injured.\n\nThe security breach happened just after 8 p.m. when Biden and the first lady were leaving the Biden-Harris 2024 headquarters in Wilmington.\n\nReporters traveling with the Bidens said the first lady had just said “happy holidays” to reporters and gotten into a presidential vehicle.

Here's what staffers will find and should expect.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nPresidential candidates often choose their self-identified hometown city as their campaign headquarters. For Hillary Clinton, it was Brooklyn, New York, and with former President Barack Obama, it was Chicago.\n\nFor Biden, it is Wilmington – a city he took the train home to every night when he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades. Wilmington carries a strong emotional weight for Biden: His political ideology was formed here, and his two children and first wife are buried here.\n\nSo far into his presidency, Biden regularly travels home to visit his grandchildren in Wilmington or to his oceanfront home near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThere’s been speculation by national media for months that Wilmington will be the campaign headquarters, with some Democratic operatives grumbling privately about the prospect.\n\nKate Bedingfield, former White House communications director for the Biden administration, said Wilmington was discussed as a possible location in 2020.\n\n“It was a very spirited debate between Wilmington and Philadelphia four years ago,” she said, “so it feels very meaningful that he's now going to have the opportunity to headquarter the reelect in Wilmington.”\n\nYet Delaware’s largest city doesn’t carry the same electoral importance as Philadelphia. In 2024, Pennsylvania is once again seen as a key state to win in order for Biden to remain in the White House.\n\nThe president will visit Philadelphia on Thursday, the sixth time since 2021, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n“Having the campaign headquartered in Wilmington,” Bedingfield said, “is reinforcing a really fundamental piece of what the president believes that public service is all about, which is … serving the families that he raised his kids alongside in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a co-chair of the reelection campaign, said in a brief interview that Delaware “represents all of America.”\n\n“We're urban, we’re suburban, we’re rural, coastal,” Blunt Rochester said. “We have demographics that mirror the country.”\n\n“Pennsylvania is still important; it's his birthplace,” she added. “And it's right up the road.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/04/29/president-joe-biden-to-visit-wilmington-nc/73500774007/", "title": "President Joe Biden to visit Wilmington, NC", "text": "President Joe Biden is set to visit Wilmington this week.\n\nAccording to an email announcement Monday afternoon from the White House, \"On Thursday, May 2, the President will travel to Wilmington, North Carolina, to discuss how his Investing in America agenda is rebuilding our infrastructure and creating good-paying jobs in Wilmington and across the country.\"\n\nJill Hopman, chair of the New Hanover County Democratic Party, said Biden is expected to visit the Port City to talk infrastructure and environmental issues Thursday afternoon. The exact time and location of the event has not yet been determined, Hopman said.\n\nWhile Biden is seeking reelection in the November presidential election, Hopman said the anticipated stop is a presidential visit, not a campaign event.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the New Hanover County Democratic Party said, \"although President Biden’s official visit is not campaign-related, it cannot come at a more-critical time during a more-critical election year in a more-critical place.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe announcement of Biden's visit comes shortly after former President Donald Trump had planned to hold a campaign event in the city, which was ultimately postponed due to weather. Trump has not yet rescheduled the event.\n\nThe last presidential visit to Wilmington was by Trump in 2020, when he named Wilmington the nation's first World War II Heritage City at Battleship North Carolina.\n\nBiden last visited North Carolina with Vice President Kamala Harris on March 26, with the two stopping in Raleigh to talk health care.\n\nReach reporter Jamey Cross at jbcross@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/25/biden-campaign-headquarters-wilmington-philadelphia/70149427007/", "title": "Wilmington as Biden's 2024 campaign HQ?

It looks like the battle for Biden to remain leader of the free world will put Wilmington \"In the Middle of it All,\" as the city motto goes.\n\nAfter hosting the locked-down campaign, which was officially based in Philadelphia, and the Democratic National Convention during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, it won't be an entirely new feel for Wilmington to be swarmed by a presidential campaign.\n\nToday's Wilmington won't feel like exile\n\nThe timing couldn't be better for Delaware's largest city of 70,000 if it hosts a fully powered presidential campaign.\n\nIn recent decades, both downtown and the Riverfront have been the scene of millions of dollars of investment, transforming the one-time sleepy city into a place where Beltway politicos *just* might be able to survive.\n\nTake Wilmington's restaurant scene for example. It is arguably the best it’s ever been, especially for visitors used to more adventurous big-city dining rooms.\n\nThe Bidens have led the way as customers of three of downtown's finest eateries. Both have dined at Bardea Food & Drink and the new Quoin Hotel & Restaurant, while Jill Biden has had a meal at La Fia in the past.\n\nNot yet confirmed, but reported by CNN and The New York Times\n\nWord of Wilmington as Biden's reelection campaign location was first reported last week by Jeff Zeleny, CNN's chief national affairs correspondent.\n\nMore:It was a moment that inspired an F Bomb. Biden celebrates 13 years of Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Biden’s campaign headquarters will be based in Wilmington, Delaware, a decision the president personally signed off on this month, aides said, as a nod to the pride in his hometown and the place where he spends most of his weekends,\" he reported April 20. \"Also under consideration was Philadelphia, where his 2020 campaign was based until the coronavirus pandemic turned it into a virtual office. But Wilmington will be at least the nominal home base of his reelection effort, with a split screen to the White House.\"\n\nOn Tuesday as Biden's reelection campaign was announced, the New York Times' Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent, also pointed to Wilmington as Biden homebase for 2024.\n\n\"Even as Mr. Biden put off a formal kickoff to his re-election bid, his team had been quietly making plans for the coming campaign. Top advisers such as Anita Dunn, Steven J. Ricchetti and Jennifer O’Malley Dillon will oversee the campaign from the White House even though the operation’s formal headquarters will almost certainly be in Wilmington, Del., under [2024 campaign manager Julie] Chavez Rodriguez’s direction,\" he wrote.\n\nA month ago, Reuters reported Wilmington as the likely headquarters under the headline, \"Biden team eyes Delaware for 2024 campaign HQ.\"\n\n\"Biden, who has said he intends to run for re-election but has yet to make a formal announcement, travels regularly on weekends to Wilmington, making it a natural place for political work outside of the White House in Washington,\" the article read.\n\nAt the time, the White House responded by saying, “We’re aware that there is no deficit of people who speculate, but very few individuals are actually knowledgeable about any of this.\"\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki's office declined to comment Tuesday on the media reports.\n\nNot everyone in Bidenworld will be happy if Wilmington wins out over Philly\n\nWhile a vibrant dining scene will greet Biden campaign workers, it may not be enough for some to get over Wilmington besting the more cultivated Philadelphia, the sixth biggest city in the country and home to 1.5 million.\n\nBack in December, some in Bidenworld went off the record to Politico grumbling about the possibility of being based (banished?) in the First State under the headline \"Dela-really?\"\n\nMore:'Please let it not be in Wilmington': Some pushback around possible Biden '24 campaign HQ\n\nOne Democratic aide anonymously quoted said, “The general vibe is, ‘Please let it not be in Wilmington.' People would be really excited about D.C., relatively excited about Philadelphia, and people would be really disappointed if it were in Wilmington.”\n\nIn the same piece, Democratic strategist James Carville didn't expect a revolt if Biden '24 called Wilmington home. After all, they want jobs.\n\n\"At the end of the day, guess what they’re all going to do? Move to Wilmington,\" Carville told them.\n\nWhat they will find\n\nFor some of Biden's campaign team, Wilmington is already familiar considering the 2020 group spent plenty of time in Wilmington as the pandemic swept across the globe.\n\nBiden based himself back home in Greenville and used Wilmington's infrastructure to run his successful campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nMore:'Bow to your queen!' Aubrey Plaza uses SNL monologue to remind Biden who rules Delaware\n\nHe gave an update about COVID-19 at Hotel du Pont, gave numerous press conferences at The Queen and took over Chase Center on the Riverfront (and its parking lot) to celebrate his victory with his family and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut this time around, Wilmington will be fully open, out from under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore seasoned staffers will probably find themselves at the aforementioned Bardea, La Fia and Quoin, along with other more refined standouts such as Hotel du Pont's Le Cavalier, Tonic Seafood & Steak and Eclipse Bistro.\n\nWe can envision them possibly even staying in town on weekends to take strolls along the Riverfront, catching a film at Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX or trying out the Jack A. Markell Trail. Although, a 40-minute drive to Philadelphia or a two-hour train ride back home to their families in Washington, D.C., may lure them away.\n\nFor the younger crowd, the Riverfront's Constitution Yards Beer Garden with its large outdoor deck and view of the Christina River should be a draw. Downtown, The Queen and The Grand could bring in some music fans, as well as Orange Street's if-you-know-you-know jazz bar Nomad.\n\nAnd across town, the dense nightlife district in the city's Trolley Square area with 10 bars in three blocks is prime for staffers looking to let loose, leaving their business suits behind.\n\nWhat we should expect\n\nDuring the Biden campaign's time in Delaware last time around, the Wilmington area got a Biden bump and plenty of attention even with the city zipped up pretty tight.\n\nHarris dined at Montchanin's Krazy Kat's restaurant, Wilmington Brew Works got some free publicity on national television when Fox News' Peter Doocy hoisted a four-pack of Biden beer dubbed Rail Car One on air, and an array of restaurants, hotels and other businesses got a boost in business from the campaign.\n\nHarris and her family stayed at The Inn at Montchanin Village & Spa, located on the same property as Krazy Kat's with the campaign paying $67,670 for the stay, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nThe reports shed light on other spending, perhaps hinting at where more campaign spending could be headed over the next 1½ years.\n\nHotels such as The Westin Wilmington ($67,155), Homewood Suites ($50,180) and Wilmington Riverfront Hotel XXXIV LLC, an LLC registered to the Buccini/Pollin Group ($26,313), all got in on the feeding frenzy. So did Platinum Dining Group's Italian restaurant Capers & Lemons with a $2,501 tab and Janssen's Market, the Greenville gourmet grocer on Kennett Pike, which accounted for $1,367 in spending.\n\nThis time around hotels and restaurants surely will earn more of that campaign cash. And the roads may boast a few more Washington, D.C., license plates, too.\n\nWe're already used to \"Joe Jam\" traffic backups when Biden is in town and the same should be expected as he continues to toggle between his Greenville home and the White House.\n\nBut with the pandemic eased, some things will be different this time around.\n\nThe Queen likely will be busy with concerts and weddings, not allowing it to be Biden's defacto press room. And the Chase Center has its own events scheduled.\n\nSo what will Biden's second presidential campaign based in Wilmington look like exactly? No one really knows, perhaps including the campaign itself as it is on Day One of its 18-month marathon to Election Day.\n\nHave a story idea?

No one returned to retrieve it, he said.\n\nIn the subsequent year and a half, Mac Isaac said, a “whole lot of” players were involved in the story that ended with President Donald Trump circle’s taking possession of a copy of the laptop hard drive, less than two months before the presidential election.\n\nMac Isaac declined to name most of them.\n\nThe hard drive reportedly contained emails from 2015 that were the basis for a New York Post story published Wednesday morning claiming then-Vice President Joe Biden held a meeting with a high-ranking official at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that had employed his son Hunter Biden.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the veracity of the claim was being challenged by Biden’s campaign, which said in a statement that no such meeting existed in the then-vice president’s official calendar.\n\n“No meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” the campaign said.\n\nLater in the day, Facebook and Twitter, in an unprecedented decision, both implemented policies limiting the sharing of the story.\n\nFacebook spokesman Andy Stone described the move as “part of our standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation,” pending a “fact-checker review.”\n\nMac Isaac repeatedly claimed he had shared the device with Costello because he was fearful for his safety. He did not explain how a move that would result in publicity would improve his security.\n\nMac Isaac also declined to state whether he approached Costello first with the hard drive or whether Giuliani’s team came to him.\n\nWhen pressed on the question, he answered in vague near-soliloquy, stating, “When you’re afraid that you don’t know anything about the depth of the waters that you’re in, you kind of, you want to find a lifeguard.”\n\nHISTORY:As Biden-Trump, Ukraine debate rages, related court cases land in Delaware\n\nLast Sunday, Giuliani gave the New York Post reporters a copy of the hard drive that had been provided by Mac Isaac, the publication said.\n\nFor nearly two years, Giuliani had been working on behalf of Trump to dig up information that could be damaging to Biden’s presidential campaign. Much of the effort has focused on finding a link between the former vice president's work in Ukraine and Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma.\n\nGiuliani has asserted repeatedly without evidence that Joe Biden had sought to protect Burisma when he pressured the Ukrainian president in 2015 into firing the country's prosecutor general.\n\nLast year, Trump himself sought out such information from Ukraine’s new president – an act that led to his impeachment.\n\nU.S. Senate Republicans last month published a report based on an investigation that looked into the claims. While they found Hunter Biden's business made State Department official's work awkward, they found no evidence that Joe Biden acted inappropriately.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Mac Isaac called the impeachment a sham.\n\nHe said he began hearing about Burisma and Ukraine shortly after Hunter Biden had left his laptop at the Trolley Square repair shop. When a customer doesn't return after 90 days, Mac Isaac says he typically will reach out to them by phone.\n\nAsked if he called Hunter Biden, Mac Isaac said, \"No comment.\"\n\n“We have customers who abandon products all of the time,\" he said.\n\nDuring the subsequent summer and fall, Mac Isaac said he became alarmed after browsing through the computer's files. He claims he then spoke with an associate more versed than him in the law and in current events.\n\nThat unnamed person then contacted the FBI, Mac Isaac said.\n\nFederal investigators from Wilmington and Baltimore then subpoenaed the laptop in December, Mac Isaac said.\n\nShortly after, they called Mac Isaac asking him to assist them, technically, in viewing the files on the damaged hard drive, he said.\n\nMac Isaac admitted that the request raised his own suspicion, given that the FBI has its own technical staff.\n\nMore:A look at Joe Biden's family tree\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Delaware’s federal prosecutors declined to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation into Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nIn the months after the alleged December subpoena, the FBI made no public statements about the contents of the hard drive. That discouraged Mac Isaac, who had hoped such information could vindicate Trump and prevent his impeachment.\n\nAt various points in his interview Wednesday, Mac Isaac insinuated the FBI had covered up the information, though he provided no evidence to verify such a suspicion.\n\nHe also stated repeatedly that he had believed that giving investigators the hard drive would amount to “following the chain of command,\" an idea that he failed to describe beyond the vague pronouncement.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

The group, which included high school students and alumni, quickly zeroed in on a topic close to home: ending racial inequities in their own school system.\n\nTheir demands to the district: the desegregation of classrooms, more Black teachers and leadership, anti-racism training and more diversity in the curriculum.\n\n“We are trying to mobilize students and not only look at racism on a national level, but also focus on Montclair,” Whitlock said.\n\nThe Montclair students are not alone. Across the nation, demonstrations that started as a protest of police brutality are also fueling demands to dismantle racism and promote inclusion in local schools. In New Jersey, students and their supporters have rallied and petitioned for change in dozens of districts, including Ridgewood, Sparta, Wayne, West Morris, West Milford and Metuchen.\n\nActivists are calling for schools to include more diverse voices in classroom lessons, to hold anti-racism training and to hire more teachers of color. In response, some districts have pledged to review curriculums and reconsider policies on discipline and student placement, two areas that advocates say are prone to bias.\n\nIn Montclair, officials pledged in their school year goals to improve students’ access to higher-level classes and to continue \"restorative justice\" programs that focus on problem resolution rather than punishment. In August, the school board passed an anti-racism resolution and added a Week of Action for Black Lives Matter, from Feb. 1 to 5, to the calendar.\n\nThe district also created a position of student representative to the school board and appointed Whitlock to the post. The senior said she and other students intend to keep up their activism.\n\n“It’s about showing up throughout the year and looking at nuances\" of racism, she said. “It’s not going to just stop after the anti-racism policy.”\n\nSocial studies 'in the crosshairs'\n\nIn Ridgewood, a group called Ridgewood for Black Liberation has demanded that district officials remove what they view as a Eurocentric curriculum. They also called for increased Black leadership and staff and for anti-racism training, in which participants acknowledge racist beliefs and structures and work to undo them.\n\n\"We need to change the way that we teach and talk about race and actually teach the real history of United States,\" said Emily Rizzo, an organizer with Ridgewood for Black Liberation, calling for schools to confront \"our white supremacist history.\"\n\nWith districts preoccupied with the coronavirus, and local budgets shredded by the pandemic, it remains to be seen how far school leaders are willing to go. But districts and activists are engaging.\n\nIn Ridgewood, teachers created online forums for staff and students to discuss civil unrest and anti-racist tactics, said Mark Ferreri, supervisor of Social Studies, World Languages & Business at Ridgewood schools. They also compiled a database of related articles and resources for teachers to use in classroom lessons.\n\nFerreri and a group of administrators and staff also met with local civic groups, including Ridgewood for Black Liberation, to hear about their experiences and their ideas on promoting diversity and equity.\n\nNot a normal school year:When gym class goes virtual, NJ phys ed teachers have to get creative\n\nFor subscribers:Push to defund police gains no traction in NJ as state's largest towns increase funds for cops\n\nAnd during sessions this summer, teachers made recommendations on equity and inclusion in instruction. Ferreri offered an example: Second-year U.S. history teachers will make Jim Crow — a set of laws and customs once used to restrict African American rights — a primary topic when teaching about the era after the Civil War, he said.\n\n“It’s always been a holistic approach, but obviously the death of George Floyd put us in a position where social studies is in the crosshairs,” he said, referring to the Black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests.\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nSome of the districts where students are pushing for reform have few students of color but are seeing a groundswell of support for diverse education. For instance, in Ridgewood, just 1% of students identified as Black in the 2018-19 school year.\n\nIn Wayne, it was 1.6%. Nonetheless, more than 5,000 alumni, parents and teachers have signed a petition calling for an evaluation of the social studies curriculum and for more Black history content.\n\nThe district has pledged to evaluate instruction, student outcomes and hiring practices in the 2020-21 school year and to create a plan of action. A committee will also review calls to change the Indians mascot, which some view as offensive. Wayne also is partnering with the Race Card Project, a web-based initiative that invites people to reflect on their experiences and thoughts about race.\n\n“We recognize that our schools are powerful agents of change and we can play a significant part in a fairer and more just future for all,” officials wrote in an August school board resolution declaring diversity, equity and inclusion among its annual goals.\n\nIn the Mountain Lakes School District in Morris County, a group of current and former students demanded the creation of a \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Advisory Board,\" amassing 730 signatures on an online petition.\n\n\"That is an ongoing topic,\" Superintendent Michael Fetherman said last month. \"I assure you the conversations have started and we're eager to continue.\"\n\n'Liberal indoctrination'\n\nThere has been pushback from critics who say teaching about racism as integral to the founding and history of the U.S. stokes anti-American sentiment and discourages patriotism.\n\nIn a speech last month, President Donald Trump decried the movement to teach about the nation's history of slavery and discrimination as \"liberal indoctrination\" and a \"form of child abuse.\"\n\n\"Our mission is to defend the legacy of America’s founding, the virtue of America’s heroes, and the nobility of the American character,\" Trump said.\n\nAs local school boards take up anti-racism measures, a few have heard similar criticisms. In West Milford, former Councilman Michael Hensley said demands in a petition for anti-racist education were not harmless.\n\n\"This anti-white philosophy and its radical ideology is really meant to inflict harm upon our children, child abuse, in fact,\" he said, adding that it would hurt students' self-esteem \"if it is rushed into and adopted prematurely.\"\n\nBlack experience:NorthJersey.com readers hope to combat racism with conversation\n\nDebate:Do police officers belong in NJ schools? Racial justice protests stir debate\n\nNew Jersey has a long way to go to undo persistent racism in what is considered one of the most segregated school systems in the nation, advocates say.\n\nThe state also has among the widest discipline gaps in the nation, suspending Black and Hispanic students at far greater rates than their white peers, federal data shows. And while about half of the 1.4 million children in public schools are of color, only 16% of their teachers are, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nTackling problems of racism in school involves far more than a new policy or an anti-racism workshop, said Awo Okaikor Aryee-Price, an anti-racism educator in New Jersey and an organizer with Black Lives Matter at School, a national coalition.\n\nFor schools to move forward, they need to work with the community and be rooted in clear principles that go beyond the idea of diversity, equity and inclusion, she said. People need to do research and review data about the experiences that Black, brown and Indigenous students face in school and look at what they have been doing to perpetuate racism, Aryee-Price said.\n\n\"This is not a one-time thing,\" she said. \"This is not a moment.

Officially nonpartisan, these boards and their elections continue to become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nAs Sadé Truiett put it, campaign checks aren't often green.\n\n\"It becomes political,\" said the vice president of advocacy with Delaware PTA. \"I mean, it shouldn't be, but at the end of the day, it's dollars and cents to run these campaigns... When the checks come in, they're blue or red.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDelaware PTA expects to focus on a few major issues this election cycle, such as health and safety in schools, learning loss recovery, school funding and boosting family engagement. Members say general opposition to social justice themes, banning books or challenging representation could appear in new packaging, from discussions of a \"Parent Bill of Rights,\" to concerns of \"indoctrination\" or similar claims across districts. But it's too soon to tell. This national organization's state arm will soon host forums to get to know Delaware's candidates.\n\n\"There may, in fact, be more competition than there was last year,\" added David Redlawsk, University of Delaware professor studying and teaching on political campaigns, elections and voter behavior. Redlawsk noted the heaviest competition has stacked up in New Castle County, with Appoquinimink, Red Clay and Christina posting contentious races with three or more candidates vying for individual seats.\n\nCompetition tends to cool as one moves down the map, but overall 12 of 19 districts will offer contested match-ups.

This is likely due to races falling in the spring, as well as a possible perception of these races as being less important. Last year, however, a Delaware Online analysis of school board election results from the past five years did reveal most districts have seen an uptick in voting since 2020.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" the PTA's Truiett said. \"We want people involved in our school boards, for people to really be speaking about the things that matter to our kids in our schools.\"\n\nThis year, election is set for May 9.\n\nWith the filing deadline earlier this month, here’s a breakdown of candidates running for school board seats as of March 15.

Joe Lagana and Assembly members Lisa Swain and Chris Tully — was considered a possible flip for Republicans.\n\nBut the race was called in Lagana's favor by the Associated Press very early Wednesday. By midday, with 97% of the vote counted, Lagana held a 27,260 to 20,878 vote lead over challenger Micheline Attieh.\n\nSwain and Tully, with 97% of the vote tallied, held slimmer leads over challengers Gail Horton and Barry Wilkes. Swain and Tully had 26,555 votes and 26,155, respectively, compared to Wilkes and Horton, with 21,013 and 21,022, respectively. The Associated Press called the race in the Democrats' favor late Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winning Democrats, led by Bergen County chairman Paul Juliano, entered a ballroom at the Hasbrouck Heights Hilton at 12:38 a.m. — as Bruce Springsteen’s \"Born to Run\" played in the background — to declare victory.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“If you look at what happened all over the state, Democrats won,” Lagana said. “Because we ran on good issues and we ran on real issues. Republicans ran on false issues and spread absolute nonsense across the state and the voters saw through it.”\n\nDistrict 38 was redistricted last year, potentially shifting the political balance. The district lost Passaic County's Hawthorne and gained Teterboro, South Hackensack, Little Ferry and Moonachie. The remainder of the district includes Bergenfield, Fair Lawn, Glen Rock, Hasbrouck Heights, Lodi, Maywood, New Milford, Oradell, Paramus, River Edge, Rochelle Park and Saddle Brook.\n\nThe election results released throughout the state Tuesday are not official and are not set to be certified until Nov. 22.\n\nNJ election results 2023:Polls have closed, some races called\n\nGopal wins in battleground Shore district\n\nDistrict 11 in Monmouth County, viewed by many as a battleground and the only one in the state with split representation, appeared to be a win for Democrats as the early, unofficial results rolled in.\n\nIncumbent state Sen. Vin Gopal said that “Monmouth County showed up in numbers we have not seen before in an off-year election” and that he and his running mates are “thrilled that our entire ticket has earned the overwhelming support of voters.”\n\nIf the results hold up, his running mates, Margie Donlon and Luanne Peterpaul, would be first-time members of the Assembly.\n\n“To be the first female practicing physician legislator in New Jersey history is an awesome responsibility that I do not take lightly,” Donlon said. “On the campaign trail, I vowed to always follow facts and science when making decisions in the Assembly and I am excited to fulfill that promise.”\n\nPeterpaul said she is “beyond humbled to have earned the support of Monmouth County residents” and that she is “also humbled to be making history as the first openly gay woman elected to the New Jersey Legislature.”\n\n“I stand on the shoulders of countless trailblazers who fought for equality and opened the door for people like me to serve my community in elected office,” she said.\n\nState Senate, Assembly results:Control of the New Jersey Statehouse on the line in 2023\n\nEd Durr — who unseated Senate President Steve Sweeney — is out\n\nAnother race many were monitoring closely, District 3 — made up of parts of Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties — seemed set to return to Democratic control.\n\nIncumbent state Sen. Ed Durr trailed former Assemblyman John Burzichelli by nearly 5,000 votes late Tuesday night as results continued to roll in. Durr shocked the state political machine two years ago with a grassroots victory over then-state Senate President Steve Sweeney.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats may have gained a seat in the Assembly in District 30 with Democrat Alexander Schnall leading incumbent Assemblyman Ed Thomson. Republican Assemblyman Sean Kean was reelected in the district that includes towns in Monmouth and Ocean counties.\n\nIn Atlantic County’s District 2 race, the Republican incumbents appeared to fend off a challenge from a reshuffled Democratic slate. In that race, Sen. Vince Polistina and Assembly members Don Guardian and Claire Swift seem likely to retain their seats.\n\nA rematch two years in the making in District 16 saw state Sen. Andrew Zwicker poised to beat Republican Michael Pappas for the second time. The district includes parts of Mercer, Somerset, Hunterdon and Middlesex counties, and was expected to be competitive by many throughout the state.\n\nZwicker’s running mates, incumbent Assemblyman Roy Freiman and Mitchelle Drulis, who is seeking to replace Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer, also held leads late Tuesday night.\n\nEarly voting, mail-in ballots — and expected low turnout\n\nPolls were open for 10 days of early in-person voting and for 14 hours on Election Day. Voters who requested ballots to vote by mail, nearly 920,000 in all, had weeks to submit them. Election reforms enacted over the last few years have made it possible for those ballots — if they were postmarked by Tuesday — to be considered valid as long as they are received by Nov 13.\n\nTurnout was expected to be low this year, as it historically has been in years without statewide or federal races atop the ballots.\n\nMore than 545,000 votes had been cast before the polls even opened on Tuesday — 124,197 from early in-person voting and 421,573 from vote-by-mail ballots, according to the state’s Division of Elections — equaling about 8% of the 6,494,988 registered voters in New Jersey.\n\nAssembly seats are up for grabs every two years but when it comes to the state Senate, New Jersey subscribes to a \"2-4-4\" approach to elections, where seats are up for election every four years except for the first term of a new decade. This allows for the latest reapportionment to be used as soon as possible.\n\nNeed to know:Our guide to New Jersey's 2023 elections for Legislature, local offices and school boards\n\nCompetitive races and the issues\n\nThough all 120 seats in the Legislature were up for grabs on Tuesday, much of the attention in the run-up to Election Day was focused on a handful of races and a few issues.\n\nDemocrats, who have controlled both the Assembly and the state Senate for two decades, spent considerable time and money trying to paint their opponents as radical extremists, warning of a rollback of reproductive health care rights.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey Republicans have been much more focused on parental rights in schools and tapping into a base that is angry about New Jersey Department of Education policy, which limits the ability of school officials to notify parents when a child is signaling a change in gender.\n\nAnother issue that has been at the forefront, especially in the week leading up to Election Day, is wind energy. The decision by Danish company Ørsted to cancel its plans to develop two massive wind farms off the South Jersey coast was a disappointment to clean energy advocates, but the project has drawn reproach from Republicans throughout the campaign season. They alleged that early work on the project was killing whales.\n\nThe Democrats were the majority party in both chambers of the Legislature going into Election Day, with a 25 to 15 majority in the Senate and a 46 to 34 majority in the Assembly, but many voters can expect to see some shakeup in their districts merely because so many lawmakers have decided it’s time to move on.\n\nThere were nearly two dozen legislators who decided not to run again and one who lost in the primary in June. Assemblyman Joseph Egan announced his retirement in July, and just a few weeks later, state Sen. Dick Codey announced his retirement after spending half a century in the Legislature.\n\nThis was also the first legislative election to use the newly drawn maps based on the 2020 census results.\n\nKatie Sobko covers the New Jersey Statehouse.

Some incumbents from both parties were overthrown, parental rights candidates for various school boards won and lost, and power shifted among seats across Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties.\n\nIt was a low-turnout election, often the case when there are no presidential, congressional or gubernatorial names on the ticket. Though all 120 seats in Trenton's Legislature were up for grabs, as of Thursday, 29.5% of registered Bergen County voters had cast their ballots, according to data provided by the county clerk's office, compared with 44.3% the year prior and 75.1% in 2020 when Joe Biden and Donald Trump faced off for president.\n\nOf course, mail-in ballots are still being counted. As long as a mail-in ballot was postmarked by Election Day and is received by Nov. 13, election officials will tally those votes. And after all other votes are counted, officials turn to the paper provisional ballots.\n\nBut based on unofficial results, here are the notable narratives that reporters for NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY Network New Jersey found while sifting through election data.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n38th District Democrats keep seats\n\nThe Democratic incumbents, Sen. Joe Lagana and Assembly members Lisa Swain and Chris Tully, held on to their seats in a newly drawn district that covers parts of Bergen and Passaic counties after spending millions of dollars to defeat Republican challengers Micheline Attieh, Gail Horton and Barry Wilkes.\n\nDemocrats have held full control of the district since 2004, but it was considered a possible flip for Republicans this year.\n\nSuper PACs and other independent expenditure groups on both sides spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to tip the scales, using funds raised from unions, advocacy groups and philanthropists.\n\n“If you look at what happened all over the state, Democrats won,” Lagana said. “Because we ran on good issues and we ran on real issues. Republicans ran on false issues and spread absolute nonsense across the state, and the voters saw through it.”\n\nBergen County Dems keep commissioner seats\n\nDemocrats running for the Bergen County Board of Commissioners declared victory in the early hours of Wednesday as results rolled in around 1 a.m.\n\nIncumbent Democrats Joan Voss and Rafael Marte will keep their seats as commissioners after defeating Republican challengers Agninshalah Collins and Mary Jo-Ann Guinchard. Marte, a former councilman in Bergenfield, was chosen to fill the seat of former Commissioner Ramon Hache, who stepped down in March. Voss said this was her 14th election.\n\nRepublicans have not held a seat on the commissioners' board since 2013.\n\nParental rights candidates lose in Westwood, Sparta\n\nVoters rejected a parental rights slate of school board candidates for the Westwood Regional School District, unseating two incumbents, Irene Fenarjian and James Parrino.\n\nFour political newcomers are poised to take seats on the nine-member board: Washington Township residents Heather Perin, Loni Azzolina and Jorge Pertuz, and Westwood resident Nicole Martin, who ran together focusing on “equitable public education for all students.”\n\nThe election followed months of tense debate in the district, which serves about 2,800 students from Washington Township and Westwood, with hundreds packing school meetings since April to discuss the board majority's decisions to push back on sex education standards, comments that seemed to denigrate same-sex parents, and a policy that led to the removal of LGBTQ+ pride signs outside school properties.\n\nThe Sparta Board of Education lost two incumbents as voters chose three members of a “Stop Raising Taxes” team over the “Voices of Reason” candidates. The slate of Kaitlin Gagnon, Jennifer Grana and Chad Wood defeated the team of Dana Dumpert, Robert Meara and incumbent Christina Longo-Keiling, as well as incumbent LeeAnne Pitzer, who ran independently under the \"Students First” banner.\n\nIn October, the township’s Board of Education rescinded its policy regarding transgender students, meaning it will consider on a case-by-case basis whether to notify parents if a student requests an accommodation regarding their gender identity or change of pronouns.\n\nDecisions including policy changes about mature reading material led to a no-confidence vote by the teachers' union against five board members, including Pitzer and Longo-Keiling.\n\n\"By focusing on the actual issues facing our Sparta district over dog-whistle political movements, we strive to redirect the board’s focus to fund allocation, facilities, staff retention, and our declining district rankings,\" the “Stop Raising Taxes” team said, pointing to a 5.8% tax increase in the budget approved earlier in the year, which they called “reckless fiscal management.”\n\nParental rights slates win in Morris districts\n\nIn Morris County, however, parental rights candidates were leading heated school board races in Hanover and Roxbury.\n\nIn Hanover, “Students Matters Most” candidates Michelle Stricchiola, William McCabe and Christopher Mattessich — who didn’t participate in an October candidates forum — led over the “Focus on Education” ticket, Christina Dunne, Karen Mascolo and Brian Gibbons.\n\nIn May, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin sued the Hanover Township school district, requesting an emergency court order to stop it from implementing a policy requiring teachers to tell parents the gender identity and sexual orientation of LGBTQ+ students. In October, a Morris County judge temporarily blocked the policy from taking effect.\n\nIn Roxbury, the parental rights “Back to Basics” slate of incumbent Anne Colucci, Valerie Galdieri and Camilo Bonilla held a lead over the “Kids First” candidates, Dan Masi, Kimberly Schwartz and incumbent Heather Champagne.\n\nHundreds packed Roxbury school board meetings in the spring to discuss LGBTQ-related library books. Roxbury High librarian Roxanna Caivano sued four residents alleging defamation after they accused her of aiding pedophiles by allowing some state-approved books in the library. The case is pending.\n\nLongest-serving Paterson school board member headed for defeat\n\nIn a race with nine contenders fighting for three school board seats, the longest-serving Paterson Board of Education member, Jonathan Hodges — an incumbent of 20 years — appeared to have lost his post.\n\nThe highest vote-getter, Mohammad Rashid, has avoided local candidate forums, and education activists say they have not seen Rashid at a Paterson school board meeting. He was backed by a coalition of City Council members allied with Mayor Andre Sayegh and key figures in the Passaic County Democratic Party, and was boosted by a Washington-based super PAC attacking Paterson school tax increases.\n\nKenneth Simmons, a 12-year school board veteran, was in second place, while the third seat was a nail-biter. Former school board member Corey Teague led by 14 votes over another former member, Vincent Arrington, as of Thursday morning. Former board member Joel Ramirez was within fighting distance in fifth place.\n\nMorristown approves leaf blower ban\n\nGas-powered leaf blowers won’t be allowed to be used in Morristown from January through September, as voters approved the ban 1,345 to 1,120 as of Thursday. The Morristown council agreed to put the matter to the voters after failing to approve the ban earlier in the year. In Essex County, Montclair is battling multiple lawsuits after passing a similar ban.\n\nClifton school board incumbents ousted\n\nIn Clifton’s Board of Education election for three seats, incumbents Jim Smith and Fahim Abedrabbo lost reelection, with newcomers Joseph Siano, Tanya Suarez and returning former trustee Joseph Canova garnering the most votes.\n\nIn Passaic County, Dems win county races, GOP dominates municipal level\n\nDemocrats swept Passaic County races, with Danielle Ireland-Imhof besting Rosemary Pino in the race for county clerk, and incumbents Bruce James and Orlando Cruz beating out Republicans Kelley Amico and Adrena Pegel for the Board of County Commissioners.\n\nIn municipal races, however, Republicans won a majority of seats, including in Ringwood, Pompton Lakes, Wanaque and West Milford, and unopposed races in Totowa and North Haledon.\n\nDemocrats won races in Bloomingdale and had unopposed races in Woodland Park and Haledon.\n\nVoters also approved three public questions: In Clifton, they sanctioned an open space tax of 1 cent per $100 of assessed property value. In Woodland Park, they consented to a non-binding measure increasing the open space tax to 3 cents per $100 of assessed value. In Little Falls, the Board of Education will cut two of its nine members by 2026.\n\nOakland mayor post back to Republican\n\nRepublican Eric Kulmala appeared to have beaten incumbent Democrat Linda Schwager for the Oakland mayoral seat by a tight margin, a reverse of the 2019 race, in which Schwager beat Kulmala by 63 votes.\n\nThe vote returns the borough to an all-male and Republican mayor and council. Republican councilmen Russell Talamini and Pasquale “Pat” Pignatelli were re-elected, beating Democratic challengers Andrea Levy and former councilman John Biale.\n\nWayne 'Children First' candidates win\n\nIncumbent President Donald Pavlak Jr. and newcomers Mark Faber and Wendy Limandri, running under a “Children First” slogan, won three seats on the Wayne Board of Education, beating out Ehab Husein and former board member Suzanne Pudup, who lost her seat last year.\n\nFormer Mahwah board member topped field\n\nBrett Coplin, who lost a reelection bid last fall, won the most votes for one of three open seats on the Mahwah Board of Education. Incumbent first Vice President Richard DeSilva Jr. and newcomer Janine Ting Jansen won the other two spots, defeating Danielle Ryan, Michelle Salzman and Geoffrey Lichtenheim.\n\nCloster council Democrats ousted\n\nThe Democratic incumbents on the Closter Borough Council, Dolores Witko and Scott Devlin, appeared to have been ousted by Republican challengers Christopher Cho and Anna Maroules. Cho and Maroules won 1,000 and 959 votes, respectively, compared with Witko's 862 and Devin's 852, as of Thursday morning.\n\nDem edges out GOP incumbent for Cresskill council\n\nA Democratic challenger overthrew one of the two Republican incumbents running for reelection to the Cresskill Borough Council. Arthur McLaughlin received 796 votes, compared with incumbent Republican James Cleary’s 789, as of Thursday morning. Republican incumbent Hector Olmo received the most votes, with 808.\n\nElmwood Park council president unseated\n\nIn the race in Elmwood Park, a Republican challenger unseated Democratic Borough Council President Sandra Balistrieri. Republican Pamela Troisi, who lost her race for a seat last year, had received 1,716 votes to Balistrieri’s 1,392 as of Thursday morning. Incumbent Lorraine Pellegrine — a longtime Democrat who switched to Republican earlier this year — held on to her seat with the most votes, 1,801.\n\nEnglewood Cliffs school board incumbent ousted\n\nJennifer Drimones earned the most votes, 680, for one of three Englewood Cliffs Board of Education seats, edging out incumbent Aman Nahar, who had gotten 473 votes as of Thursday morning. Two other incumbents held on: Philip Choi and Kimara Patton, with 612 and 549 votes, respectively.\n\nHackensack board incumbent gained fewest votes in field of nine\n\nAndrew Jude Meehan, a retired military officer appointed to the Hackensack school board in June, received the fewest votes — 431 — among nine candidates jockeying for three seats. Candidates Mark Stein, Kenneth Martin and Shivonnie Pringle had the most votes as of Thursday morning, with 1,960, 1,913 and 1,755.\n\nHarrington Park school incumbent out\n\nJennifer Helfman edged out one of two incumbents fighting for two seats on the Harrington Park school board, getting 655 votes. Incumbent Stephen Hahm had the second-most votes, 631, as of Thursday morning, and incumbent Peter Toomin trailed with 503.\n\nNorthvale council Democrat edged out\n\nDemocrat John Hogan appeared to have lost his seat on the Northvale Borough Council. Republicans Laura Fernandez and Hovannes Bakalian got 646 and 621 votes, respectively compared with Hogan's 542 votes as of Thursday morning.\n\nPalisades Park school board incumbent out\n\nThe only incumbent running for the school board in Palisades Park, Hea Young “Helen” Jeon, received the fewest votes among the field of six competing for three seats. As of Thursday morning, Sookyung Park had the most votes, with 732, with Boyoung Yu in second at 677. Yongman Kim and Aaron Pak were tied for third, with 644 votes each.\n\nParamus council Democrat out\n\nDemocratic incumbent Mariaelena Bellinger lost her seat on the Paramus Borough Council, bested by Republicans Mary Ellen Rizzo and Alfredo Nadera, who had received 3,966 and 3,921 votes to her 2,764 as of Thursday morning.\n\nRidgefield school incumbent or two unseated\n\nIt appears an incumbent or two may lose their seats on the Ridgefield Board of Education, as challengers Lori Hoffman and Theodore Christolias led the pack with 810 and 560 votes. Incumbent Andrew Louis Grippa was holding third, at 531 votes, with his colleagues Melissa Vudragovic and Rafael Morilla-Fraga trailing with 512 and 328 votes as of Thursday morning for three open seats.\n\nRidgewood school board incumbent out\n\nMichael Lembo lost his seat on Ridgewood’s school board, with newcomer Mary Micale and incumbent Saurabh Dani holding the most votes as of Thursday morning for two open seats.\n\nRiver Edge district incumbent gets fewest votes\n\nIncumbent Bobby Abraham Kuriakose received the fewest votes in a five-way race for two seats on the River Edge Board of Education. Incumbent Elizabeth Brown and Joshua Koen led the pack.\n\nOne Rochelle Park school board incumbent out\n\nAt least one incumbent appeared to have been edged out in the race for three seats on the Rochelle Park school board, as Christina Holz had the second-highest vote count, 544, competing against three incumbents. Scott Kral and Joseph Marolda seem to be holding their spots, with 546 and 536 votes, and incumbent Charles Schaadt was in last place with 395 votes as of Thursday morning.\n\nTeaneck Board of Education incumbent out\n\nIncumbent Nadia Hosein appeared to have lost a seat on the Teaneck school board, in fifth place as of Thursday in a race for three seats. Gerald Kirshenbaum, David Gruber and James Wolff were in the top three spots.\n\nWoodcliff Lake council incumbent out\n\nRepublicans Julie Brodsky and Joshua Stern were in the lead for two spots on the Woodcliff Lake Borough Council, pushing out Democratic incumbent Richard Schnoll.\n\nThere were several other races with incumbents behind but by such small margins that they were too close to call, given that mail-in and provisional ballots had yet to be included in the tally.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/05/05/kent-county-delaware-school-board-elections-2023-your-guide-to-candidates/70178729007/", "title": "Kent County school board elections 2023: Your guide to candidates", "text": "While often sparsely attended in past years, school board meetings in some communities are becoming more crowded and controversial with topics like in-person vs. virtual instruction, mask mandates, safety concerns, bullying, transgender policies and parents' involvement in curriculum choices.\n\nIn Kent County, residents will have the chance to choose representatives on boards during elections Tuesday, May 9, in Smyrna, Caesar Rodney and Milford school districts, while three districts don't have elections – Capital, Lake Forest and Woodbridge – because candidates were unopposed.\n\nHow do I vote in Delaware school board elections?

Simpson Elementary, 5 Old North Road, Wyoming\n\nW. Reily Brown Elementary, 360 Webbs Lane, Dover\n\nTawanna Prophet Brinkley, Magnolia\n\nBackground: A school counselor in the Lake Forest District for seven years, Prophet Brinkley was previously a paraprofessional at Fifer Middle School and a preschool teacher for the Early Childhood Assistance Program. She has two children who have graduated from the CR District and one attending now. She’s served as a board member at Early College High School and for four years as first vice president for the national sorority Phi Delta Kappa-Alpha Pi Chapter. She declined to give her age or political party, saying, “I am not influenced by a political party and instead am running with the focus of what is in the best interest of our students. The group that will be influencing the decisions I make are the citizens of the Caesar Rodney School District, the families and the students.”\n\nIssues: The top three factors that motivated her to run for the board are the need for equity, transparency and more parent engagement. She said the most important issues in districts across the country, not just in CR, are staff retention and safety.\n\nWhile the district referendum April 22 didn’t pass, Prophet Brinkley said she was in favor of the plan: “The referendum would have allowed the district to increase educators' salaries and make needed repairs for our schools.”\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices and transgender policies, she said she wouldn’t comment on critical race theory specifically but, “Culturally relative/culturally responsive teaching is a priority. I believe parental involvement in the district's curriculum choices should be taken into consideration. Regarding transgender policies, I believe we should treat all individuals like we would want to be treated and that is with love, respect and support.”\n\nNicole Hill, 44, Dover\n\nBackground: Hill is the Kent County coordinator for Read Aloud Delaware since March 2021, recruiting, training and coordinating volunteers to read in childcare centers and writing grant proposals to help fund the program. She worked for the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control as an environmental scientist and program manager. She has three children who attend district schools and listed her political affiliation as independent.\n\nIssues: Hill decided to run for the board because, “I am a proud CR graduate and I received an excellent education that helped to prepare me for college and the workforce. I want the same, or better, for all of the students attending CR schools.” She is concerned about the safety of students and staff and heard other parents express concerns. “As a mom of three kids that attend schools in the district and a wife of a CR teacher, I felt that I could offer a unique perspective in these areas as well as many others.”\n\nShe said the top issue is the recruitment and retention of quality educators. She favors competitive pay, expanding the search for candidates by also recruiting outside Delaware and using alternative certification programs for those with degrees other than in education. She wants to encourage students interested in becoming teachers by promoting the high school’s education pathway.\n\nAs for the district referendum that failed April 22, Hill was initially against the plan, \"but after attending one of the district meetings explaining the need for the referendum, I felt that I had a much better understanding of why it was necessary.” She said the district should improve communication with the community and explain what’s been done to cut expenses before asking for another referendum because an increase in taxes is difficult for most families, including hers. \"However, it is challenging for the district to continue to provide high-quality programs as well as recruit and maintain quality educators without adequate operating funds,” she said.\n\nOn controversial issues like critical race theory, parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices and transgender policies, Hill said, “Students should have access to a wide variety of educational resources. Schools should foster an environment that encourages the exploration of different perspectives and ideas while ensuring that materials are developmentally appropriate. I am in favor of parental involvement in the district’s curriculum choices.”\n\nSchool boards should listen to families, review the curriculum, seek expert advice, consider alternatives and communicate the decisions transparently.\n\n“All students have the right to access quality education without discrimination,” she said.\n\nEmily Phelan, 40, Magnolia\n\nBackground: An Air Force veteran, Phelan also worked as a medical receptionist and is now a Realtor. She is the Allen Frear Elementary PTA vice president with a daughter who attends the school and a stepson who graduated from the district. As for political affiliation, she said she's fiscally conservative but more libertarian in her views that political/social agendas shouldn’t be part of public school education.\n\nIssues: She was motivated to run for the board because teachers need help, students are falling behind particularly with low reading and math scores, and change is needed. She said the top issue in the district is disciplinary discrepancy. She favors examining discipline policies to make them more consistent, with more accountability and transparency. “We need to have ground rules. They need to be clear cut,\" Phelan said. \"While younger children need more guidance in what is right and wrong, by the time the older students are getting ready to go out into the world, they need to be better prepared for the consequences of their actions.”\n\nAs for the district referendum that failed April 22, Phelan said she realizes the district needs help, but she was against this referendum because she wants more transparency about how the district is spending money. She believes schools need financial help, “but this was asking too much, too fast with too little information.”\n\nOn controversial issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, Phelan said, “I’m all for parental rights in schools. More parents should be involved. That will help with accountability and teacher-parent relations. I also believe political and social agendas shouldn’t be part of school curriculum. Maybe we could have after-school programs for parents who want that for their children.”\n\nLake Forest\n\nNo election.

School Lane, Smyrna\n\nSmyrna Middle School, 700 Duck Creek Parkway, Smyrna\n\nKenton Ruritan Club, 249 S. Main St., Kenton\n\nMarie Fontaine St. Pierre, 39, Smyrna\n\nBackground: A Realtor for nearly six years, Fontaine St. Pierre has a 17-year-old son who attends Smyrna High School. For four years, she's served on the town of Smyrna Board of Adjustment which rules on zoning variance requests. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board. She declined to disclose her political party, advocating a neutral approach in school board elections.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying, and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who attends Smyrna High School and a daughter at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm. She declined to disclose her political party: “I believe that a school board election is not a political race.\"\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She also favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “In my opinion, all races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or rest room of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nWoodbridge\n\nNo election.

However, a lack of scrutiny, deterrents, or escort can lead voters to roam halls shared by students in search of a bathroom, water fountain or curiosity fix.\n\nSo why are schools still used as voting sites? Accessibility. The schools are accessible to voters because of their central locations and they are accessible to voters with disabilities.\n\nCloster takes a stand\n\nThe associated fears of a more sinister motive to roam led by Parkland and other school shootings recently culminated in the elimination of the Hillside Elementary and Tenakill Middle schools as polling locations in Closter, said Joanne Newberry, district superintendent.\n\nAfter a seven-year push from district officials and residents, the schools are due to be replaced this June by the borough’s senior center and library.\n\n“In this world, like it or not, things have changed and we have to be more careful,” Newberry said. “It took a lot of time, but it was well worth the fight.\"\n\nOn Election Day 2016, more than 3,600 voters passed through Closter’s two schools, records show. There were no negative interactions, though one student had a bit of a scare when a senior citizen ended up in a bathroom reserved for second-graders, Newberry said.\n\n“You really have no idea who’s walking in,” Newberry said. “Sometimes people would end up near the classrooms, and that’s very problematic.”\n\nOf the 147 municipalities in Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Morris counties, 92 have voting in schools – ranging from pre-K to post-graduate – per unofficial election records obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com in late March.\n\nWhich schools are used as polling sites?\n\nIn Bergen and Passaic counties, schools account for roughly half of all polling places. That ratio falls to about 1 in 3 in Essex County and 1 in 4 in Morris County.\n\nState statute calls for county boards to contact owners of private buildings suitable for polling. However, preference for polling locations is statutorily given to schools and public buildings without “detrimental interruption of school or the usual public services,\" state law states.\n\nAs recently as 2016, Haledon school board officials cited the potential for disruptions and security threats when unsuccessfully petitioning the Passaic County Board of Elections to eliminate polling from schools.\n\nDespite concern and inconveniences for students and staff, the reasons for polling in nearly 390 schools across Bergen, Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties are convincing. Schools are often well dispersed in a community’s voting districts, near ample parking, and accessible to those with disabilities.\n\nDomenick Stampone, Haledon's mayor, said the convenience and the free lesson in civics far outweigh any speculative security concerns.\n\n“It must be stressed that we have offered to assist (the school district) with security, traffic details, et cetera,” Stampone said. “Voting is an American tradition like no other. Schools should welcome the event.”\n\nObstacles to relocation\n\nIn New Jersey, county boards of elections are charged with determining polling locations with the assistance of municipal clerks.\n\nThe most common factors preventing relocation are wheelchair and public accessibility, said John Currie of the Passaic County Board of Elections. The locations must be near or within district boundaries and able to accommodate the maximum turnout, he added.\n\n“Accessibility is the key,” Currie said. “This is our democracy and we want to give every voter every opportunity to vote and make it convenient as for the voters as we possibly can.”\n\nAccessibility has kept voting at the Paradise Knoll Elementary School in West Milford for more than 15 years. Formerly located at a nearby church, the polling location moved to the school following a property maintenance disagreement, according to local officials.\n\nBeyond being “dangerous to give people essentially unrestricted access to schools,” the persistence of voting at the school is unfair to staff attempting to educate, said Kate Romeo, a school parent.\n\n“They have to worry about the social, emotional well-being of students in addition to instruction and security already – without having to deal with thousands of people walking in to the school,” she said.\n\nRocco DiAntonio, another school parent, said enough public pressure should force a move. However, Lou Signorino, a West Milford councilman, said attempts to find an alternate venue have been genuine, yet unsuccessful.\n\nA town-owned firehouse and ambulance building are in the district but have deficient accessibility and parking, he said. Two churches in the district have also recently rejected requests to take on voting, Cytowicz said. The church representatives expressed their own concerns about safety and the cost of hiring additional security during elections, he said.\n\n“I completely understand,” Cytowicz said. “There are church shootings too.”\n\nSchools said no to voters\n\nJefferson County, Colorado, banned voting in schools following the 1999 school shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 people and injured 20 others. West Virginia and Rhode Island close all public schools during primary and general elections.\n\nCurrie has suggested legislation that would give New Jersey students the day off, as has Joan Voss, a Bergen County freeholder who served as a state assemblywoman from 2004 to 2012.\n\nA 2013 study by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration also suggested making Election Day an in-service day for schools. Per the report, about a quarter of the nation’s votes were cast in schools in 2008 and 2012.\n\n“In the end, there is no better alternative than schools,” the report stated. “There are few locations more familiar and convenient to voters.”\n\nThe suggestions to allow voters access to student-free schools have gained little traction in New Jersey, however, despite the inconvenience and confusion that can come with relocation spurred by school security concerns, said Voss, a former educator.\n\nWest Milford officials closed all eight district schools in 2016 to cope with an expected record turnout for the presidential election. On that day, 1,678 of 2,457 eligible registered voters cast ballots at the school, county records show. Turnout dropped to 1,011 voters in 2017, when schools were open.\n\nThe district's schools are set to remain open on election days through the 2019 primary, records show. However, district calendar changes as urged by Romeo and other parents are still possible, Cytowicz said.\n\n“We may lose this type of day in the middle of the week during a snow storm,” he said. “To me, it’s no big difference.\"\n\nMiguel Hernandez, the Haledon superintendent, said closing schools remains a tough sell. Further disrupting what is already a three-day Election Day week due to the state teacher convention is not necessarily ideal, he said. Non-holiday closures or half-day schedules also often create a need for many parents to arrange child care, he added.\n\nElisabeth Ginsburg, the president of the Glen Ridge Board of Education, said an aversion to closing schools led the district to solicit Glen Ridge Women's Club officials to open their venue to voting in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n“Our only other alternative would have been to close schools on polling days, which would have meant a loss of instructional time that we would have had to make up by either shortening breaks or keeping school open longer in June,” Ginsburg said.\n\nSecurity strategies\n\nIn New Milford, district officials responded to recent school shootings by adding two full-time school resource officers. The district now has one specially trained officer in each of its four schools, three of which are used for polling.\n\nMichael Polizzi, the district superintendent, said the measure eliminates the need to contract the local police on election days. However, he said the added security personnel does not excuse “inviting total strangers into a school building during a school day.”\n\n“You wouldn’t do it in your home,” Polizzi said. “You have no idea who’s coming into that school building.”\n\nWayne DeAngelo, the state Assembly’s deputy speaker (D – Mercer, Middlesex), sponsors a bill that would require schools to have state-approved security plans and state-funded uniformed officers or other protections in place to maintain school operations during elections.\n\n\"If the kids are going to be there, and the district doesn't want to shut down, then we should be working to ensure the protection of the kids,\" he said. \"The simplest way to do that is through the presence of law enforcement.\"\n\nDeAngelo's bill, A2461, would would ban voting from any school that could not provide proper voter supervision or keep voters confined to a room accessible only by exterior door.\n\nBoth of those circumstances hold true at Haledon Public School, where the smaller of two gyms is occupied by voting booths every June and November.\n\n“When they’re outside in the courtyard or the play area, walking to school or leaving the building, that’s where it becomes tricky,” Hernandez said. “On those days, we put extra teachers, extra eyes out there to ensure that the kids are going home with the right parents.”\n\nLiesl Iza, who has a son attending Haledon Public School, said officials appear to be managing the situation well. There really is no better location for polling, she said.\n\n“Perhaps it would be better if the students weren’t there, but given the situation the administrators and police do a good job of securing the premises and making it work,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/01/26/record-numbers-students-seeking-accommodations/96162464/", "title": "Growing number of students seeking accommodations for SAT", "text": "Deena Yellin\n\nStaff Writer, @deenayellin\n\nIn 2015-16, the College Board received 160,000 requests\n\nNow, most students with an IEP calling for test-taking modifications will automatically receive them\n\nApplies to all tests administered by College Board: SAT, PSAT, SAT and AP exams\n\nStudent requests for extra time, more breaks or a quieter room when taking the SAT have doubled over the past five years, according to the College Board, which administers the test.\n\nThat upward trend for these requests — known as accommodations — is likely to continue as the number of children being diagnosed with a disability continues to grow and a new policy, which took effect Jan.1, now makes it easier for students to get an accommodations approval when taking the SAT.\n\nHigh school guidance counselors and parents of disabled students across North Jersey say the change is long overdue and will help streamline the process for thousands who lack the resources to fight the denial of an accommodations request.\n\nFor years, parents and guidance counselors have complained about the difficulty of obtaining approval for modifications in taking the SAT, even if the student is already receiving similar supports in school because of a classified disability.\n\nRobert Valli, supervisor of guidance at Cresskill High School, used to spend hours gathering and sending paperwork to the College Board in order to document a student's disability and need for accommodations. The student then had to wait several weeks for a response. \"Sometimes the kids were frustrated because they couldn't take the test until they heard back,\" he said.\n\nNow, under the new policy, most students with an individualized education plan (IEP) that includes modifications for test-taking will receive automatic approval for the same supports when taking the SAT, PSAT, SAT subject tests and AP exams, which are all administered by the College Board. The new policy does not apply to the ACT, which is administered by a different group.\n\n\"This cuts down on the paperwork and on the time,\" Valli said, adding that he's seen more students apply for the modifications in recent years. \"Now the approval will be easier and simpler.\"\n\nThe new regulation comes as the number of requests to the board has soared, officials said:\n\nIn 2015-16, the board received approximately 160,000 requests;\n\nIn 2014-15, requests totaled 108,000;\n\nIn 2010-11, there were 80,000.\n\nThe vast majority — 85 percent — of the requests are approved.\n\n\"In New Jersey we have more students with IEP and 504 plans (a specified educational plan for students who have an impairment) than we had five years ago and definitely more than 10 years ago,\" said Dana Karas, president of the New Jersey School Counselor Association, who attributed the increase in accommodations requests in part to the surge in classified students. Because many students feel the adaptations can lead to higher SAT scores, there is an impetus to get an edge, she said, adding that higher scores can yield scholarship money and acceptance to better colleges.\n\nRoughly 220,000 students in New Jersey have a special education classification, according to the New Jersey Department of Education. Guidance counselors at Bergenfield High School, Passaic High School, Emerson High School and the Northern Valley Regional High School District say the numbers of students requesting special accommodations on the college entrance exams are on the rise.\n\nMaking a difference\n\nThe ultimate goal is to level the playing field so that all students can prove themselves, said Heidi Cosmic-Godau, supervisor of guidance at West Milford High School. \"You want students to have the accommodations that will help them demonstrate what their abilities are, so you want to eliminate the barriers,\" she said.\n\n\"For students with anxiety, the time limit really affects their ability to think. They are more worried about running out of time than doing their best. Some students don't even need the extended time, but it helps reduce their stress level.\"\n\nFor one Glen Rock High School graduate, taking the SAT with 100-percent extra time (eight hours in total) and additional breaks made all the difference, said his mother, who did not want to be identified. \"The request was handled by a case manager for the child study team who did all the paperwork,\" said the mother. Her son, who suffers from severe dyslexia, \"absolutely needed that time and those extra breaks,\" she said, adding that he's been very successful as a college student.\n\nIt was not always easy to secure such accommodations. Kristen Antone, 20, of Middletown had special support since elementary school due to processing issues and problems with visual motor perception, said her mother, Karen Antone. But when she applied for accommodations for the SAT, the College Board demanded a new evaluation proving her disability.\n\n\"At the time, my husband had just passed away and I didn't have $1,000 for an evaluation,\" Antone said. She appealed to the district, the College Board and various special needs groups for help but to no avail. Kristen had to take the SAT without accommodations and scored 60 points lower than required by the college of her choice.\n\nShe is currently an honors student at her second-choice college but believes she would have had a shot at getting into the college of her dreams had she been granted the accommodations. \"It wasn't fair that if you had $1,000 you had a better chance of going to a good college than someone else,\" Antone said. \"The new policy is how it should be.\"\n\nUnder the new policy, if the answer is \"yes\" to both \"is the requested accommodations in the student's plan\" and \"has the student used the accommodations for school testing,\" the student is automatically eligible for the accommodations on the College Board exam. Once students are approved for the accommodations with the College Board, they don't need to reapply if they want to retest. Colleges are not notified if students utilize accommodations.\n\nReason for change\n\nCollege Board spokeswoman Maria Alcon-Heraux said the new policy was made in response to educators, parents and students who requested that the board cut down on the red tape. \"The process will further reduce confusion and uncertainty by aligning College Board accommodation with students' existing IEP, 504 plans and other formal school-based plans. All students should have access to the testing accommodations they need so they can show their best work on our assessments.\"\n\nMore students today are getting special services and accommodations because schools today are better at identifying issues early, said Betty Faber, a tutor for the past 17 years in Tenafly. Getting the extra help can make a world of a difference. \"You can have a very bright kid who has poor processing delay or an auditory delay, and these kids can do very well if you give them extra accommodations.\"\n\nThe SAT can be a daunting exam for any student, but it's even worse for those who suffer from ADHD, dyslexia or other disabilities. \"Classified students are already struggling. There's a lot of drama over taking tests,\" said Linda Leenstra, a special education advocate and special needs consultant based in Sussex County, who welcomes the loosened restrictions.\n\nBut some parents and experts are critical of anything that might make it easier for some students to gain an edge over their peers. Kate Robinson, a college consultant based in Wayne, agrees \"100 percent there are going to be situations with students who should not be receiving accommodations.\"\n\nTypes of accommodations\n\nExamples of typical accommodations available for test-takers with disabilities", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2016/11/18/transgender-teens-quietly-gain-rights/93897824/", "title": "Transgender teens quietly gain rights", "text": "Abbott Koloff, and Andrew Wyrich\n\nNorthJersey\n\nPolicies from North Jersey high schools regarding transgender students vary widely\n\n47 of 62 North Jersey high school districts have transgender student policies in place\n\n10 North Jersey high school districts provide some form of privacy for transgender students from parents\n\nAlmost 50 North Jersey high school districts quietly passed policies during the past few years spelling out the rights of transgender students, from what bathrooms they can use to the pronouns and names used to describe the student to the definitions of terms such as \"gender expression.\"\n\nThe process has continued unabated and often without a great deal of public attention, even as a national debate over the issue raged in recent months and the federal government issued mandates.\n\nThrough a months-long examination of public records, The Record found that 47 of 62 North Jersey high school districts had transgender policies in place — and that transgender policies were already commonplace prior to a May letter issued by federal justice and education officials laying out requirements for schools to accommodate transgender students.\n\nBut in the absence of state guidelines, there are vast differences among the region’s policies – particularly when it comes to one of the issue’s most sensitive questions: Should districts inform parents when their children come out as transgender at school?\n\nMost policies reviewed by The Record require such notification, but 10 provide some privacy for transgender students even from parents, in some cases requiring the student’s permission to call the home. Some experts said this was an important safety provision, given high suicide and homelessness rates among transgender children whose families didn’t support them.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe fear of rejection often is so strong among transgender students that even those who are close to their parents said they were anxious when they came out.\n\nGio Leotsakas, 16, of Wayne said he wrote a letter to his mother to tell her he was not her daughter but her son, and was so nervous after reading about transgender children being thrown out of their homes that he packed a bag as a precaution. Another transgender boy, Jonah Elgamal, 15, whose family is Muslim and who lived until recently in West Milford, said he was “freaking out” when he came out as transgender because he could not imagine going through the pain of hiding his real self any longer.\n\n►Growing up transgender: North Jersey kids tell of unease, bullying, acceptance\n\nIn both cases, the boys said they had been embraced not only by family but also by school officials, who began calling them by their new names and allowing them to use restrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity.\n\n“They gave me so much more than I expected,” Gio said of officials at Wayne Hills High School, adding that their response made him so happy that he \"wanted to cry so bad.\"\n\nJonah said he was “lucky and grateful” for the way he was treated at West Milford’s Highlander Academy, and that his father’s family, including a grandmother who lives in Egypt, immediately accepted him as a boy. He explained it this way: “The Koran doesn’t say anything about being born in the wrong body.”\n\nBoth boys said they knew that not every transgender child got as much support as they did, and that they had read about children committing suicide or becoming homeless after being rejected by their families. Those stories are at the heart of what some experts said is the most pressing question related to transgender policies: parental notification.\n\n“We don’t want schools to be in the business of outing students,” said Aaron Potenza of Garden State Equality, an advocacy group for people who are gay or transgender, citing “high incidences of family abandonment” for LGBT children.\n\nThat issue was the focus of a fierce debate when Pascack Valley Regional High School officials adopted a policy in April amid threat of a lawsuit by a conservative Christian legal group. While some of those opposed to the policy cited religious concerns, others said their biggest issue was its requirement for a student’s consent to call parents.\n\nHolly Schepisi, a Republican assemblywoman, spoke against the policy in the spring, citing her concerns about lack of parental involvement. In a recent interview, she said that students struggling with gender identity needed the support of their families, but that exceptions should be made in cases where a family did not accept a student’s gender identity.\n\n“That is what family units are supposed to be there for: to guide children through those difficult times,” Schepisi said. “If there are any real concerns where a child says to a teacher or guidance counselor, ‘My parents will never accept me this way and I’m fearful for what will happen to me at home,’ then I understand case-by-case scenarios where parents wouldn’t participate in decisions such as this.”\n\nMost of the North Jersey policies appear to have been adopted with little public scrutiny, with districts often approving them as part of a consent agenda, in which school boards take one vote to adopt a larger group of policies. All but a handful of the transgender policies were adopted with unanimous votes, and all but six were approved prior to the federal government’s May letter.\n\nThe transgender policies remained so far off the radar last year that Governor Christie seemed unaware of them as he campaigned in New Hampshire and was asked about California transgender policies. CNN reported that Christie said New Jersey had no such issues. His office recently declined to elaborate.\n\n“Men go to men's rooms, women go to women's rooms, and there really shouldn't be a whole lot of confusion about that – public accommodations,” Christie said in December, according to CNN. “And I don't think we should be making life more confusing for our children.”\n\nBy then, more than two dozen North Jersey schools had adopted transgender policies, with the first being approved in 2013.\n\nThe following year, the U.S. Department of Education said transgender students were protected under Title IX, a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The U.S. Justice and Education departments issued more specific guidelines in May, saying that transgender students must be treated the same as other students of the same gender identity and framing the matter as a civil rights issue. Experts said schools could lose federal money if they did not comply. More than 20 states – New Jersey is not among them – are opposing the guidelines in pending lawsuits.\n\nIt is unclear what impact the election of Donald Trump as president will have on the issue, particularly in New Jersey – where some school officials have said their policies are an extension of state civil rights laws. Trump, earlier this year, was critical of a North Carolina law barring transgender people from using restrooms based on their gender identity, saying that people should “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.” He later said the matter should be decided by states and not the federal government.\n\nMost transgender policies reviewed by The Record are based on a model written by Strauss Esmay, a New Jersey company that specializes in creating school policies. But the policies diverge in significant ways.\n\nFor example, 28 districts list transgender students’ rights, including restroom use, in some detail, while 19 simply list issues to be discussed on a case-by-case basis, without specifying the rights.\n\nNone of the policies go into detail about what happens when students come out as transgender and their parents disapprove, saying only that school officials would hold a meeting with families. A study by the City University of New York recently found that the risk of suicide triples for transgender people who experience a “high level” of rejection from their families.\n\nPhilip Nicastro, of Strauss Esmay, said parental consent might be a more significant issue than parental notification. Once students come out at school, he said, their parents are likely to find out from another student’s parents regardless of whether the school calls them. But he said there was no clear guidance from government officials about what should happen next when the transgender student’s parents object. The issue was not mentioned in May’s letter from the federal government.\n\n“The letter is silent about non-consenting parents,” Nicastro said. “New Jersey is silent. Nobody wants to touch it.”\n\nThe Record asked North Jersey superintendents via email how they would handle it if a parent disagreed with a student’s gender identity. Only a handful of districts responded, and typically said they would consult their attorneys in such cases.\n\nGio and Jonah, both of whom talked to The Record with the permission of their parents, said parental notification requirements might put some students in danger or hinder them from expressing their true selves. The districts where they came out, West Milford and Wayne, both have parental notification requirements.\n\n“For some kids, it’s not safe to come out at home,” said Jonah, who now lives with his family in another part of the state. He said he was unaware that West Milford, which adopted its policy in August, did not have one at the time he came out. Acceptance by school and family, he said, helped him “to be myself” and eased his anxiety and depression.\n\nGio, who plans to wrestle at Wayne Hills this year, said he was nervous when he and his mother met with school officials last year, and he was ecstatic when they offered him everything he wanted. But he said there were situations where parents should not be notified: “If home is hard to deal with, school should be a safe place.”\n\nHis mother, Nancy Leotsakas, said she didn’t initially know the meaning of the word \"transgender\" and blamed herself for Gio’s depression before he came out. Now, she said, she realizes he was angry because he was unable to express himself. He’s now “happy all the time,” she said, adding that she understood why some schools don’t contact parents.\n\n“I would want my child to feel secure somewhere if they don’t feel safe at home,” Leotsakas said. “If you love them, that’s what you want for them.”\n\nKim Barron, Mahwah’s school board president, said she voted against her district’s policy last year, even though it required parents to be notified, because she believed it lacked clarity in at least two areas.\n\nShe said she was concerned about the privacy rights of students who are not transgender, and how schools would accommodate them if they wanted to use a private restroom facility. She also said she was concerned about what would happen when parents disagree with a student about his or her gender identity.\n\nThe Mahwah district’s policy, like most others, does not specify whether the school would side with the student or the parent.\n\n“I don’t think it’s the school’s place to decide,” Barron said. “It’s up to the parents.”\n\nPotenza said he knew of two districts in the state that had accommodated transgender students even against the wishes of parents. But at least one North Jersey district recently sided with parents against a student before the parents eventually changed their minds, he said. (Potenza did not identify the districts.) When children come out, he said, it is not unusual for parents to react negatively at first before learning more about the issue and accepting them.\n\nStuart Green, director of the New Jersey Coalition for Bullying Awareness, said transgender students faced the risk of being thrown out of the home in some cases, and said “schools should stand up even in the face of enmity of the parents.”\n\nRobyn Gigl, an attorney and a transgender woman, said schools were placed in a “difficult dilemma” when parents disagreed but added that “a school would be within its rights if it accommodated a child.”\n\nMaureen Weir, principal of Wayne Hills, said her school would encourage transgender students to talk to their parents and that counselors would be supportive. “The ultimate goal would be to bridge it somehow,” Weir said of cases where parents do not agree, adding that she had not encountered such a situation. “Your goal is always to support the family.”\n\nIt is less clear what districts without policies are doing to accommodate transgender students. Nicastro said he believed they were following the May guidelines. But he said some superintendents might be hesitant to press the issue with a written policy because the subject could be controversial.\n\n“I get calls from superintendents saying boards don’t want to adopt policies,” Nicastro said.\n\nThe Record asked 15 North Jersey districts that don’t have policies to specify how they accommodate transgender students. Just two of the districts – Glen Rock and Northern Valley – acknowledged allowing transgender students to use restroom and other facilities based on their gender identity, among other accommodations.\n\nIf there is confusion in New Jersey, some experts said, it stems from a lack of guidance from the state Department of Education, which has suggested that districts consider adopting policies but has no plans to recommend guidelines.\n\nThis contrasts with at least 10 states that offer some guidance for their schools, according to Garden State Equality. New York, for example, suggests that school officials consult the transgender student before talking to parents, because of “safety concerns.” It also recommends a fairly simple solution to privacy issues in locker rooms: curtains.\n\nThe association that oversees high school sports in New Jersey plans to revisit requirements that transgender athletes provide legal documents or doctors’ notes in order to play on teams based on their gender identities, an attorney for the organization said in a recent interview.\n\nThe New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association is expected to reexamine its policy for transgender athletes this school year in light of a letter that appears to bar such requirements, which the federal government sent to schools nationwide in May.\n\n“Given the mandates, we’re going to look at it to see if we need to change it,” Steven Goodell, an attorney for the association, said of the policy in an interview last month.\n\nThe association’s policy, which has been in place for six years, requires transgender students to provide records or doctors’ letters as proof of their gender identity.\n\nThe federal government, in the May letter, said that no medical diagnosis was needed and that requiring transgender students to provide documentation might violate Title IX, a federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nTransgender students “often are unable to obtain identification documents that reflect their gender identity,” federal officials wrote.\n\nGoodell said the association’s requirements were meant to be guidelines for schools, and that it was up to school officials to determine the gender identity of students for the purpose of playing sports. But while the association said it deferred to schools, schools appear to defer to the association. North Jersey school district policies spelling out the rights of transgender students often refer to the association’s rules as governing participation in athletics.\n\nThe association’s transgender policy was among the first in the nation for high school sports, Goodell said. Only a “handful” of districts have asked about it over the past six years, he said, and the association has no way of knowing how many transgender students are participating in athletics across the state. The policy was created when a Burlington County district, which he did not identify, told the association that a transgender girl wanted to play field hockey.\n\n“I don’t know whether the student played or not,” Goodell said.\n\nRobyn Gigl, an attorney and advocate for people who are transgender, said the policy was “courageous” because it was groundbreaking when it was implemented. She said she believed it had been created because of a concern that some high school boys would attempt to play on girls’ teams to gain a competitive advantage. But, she added, there are no known cases of that occurring, and such fears are “not based on reality at all.”\n\nThe association’s policy calls for students to provide documents that “demonstrate legal recognition of the student’s reassigned sex,” like a birth certificate, driver’s license or passport. Without such documentation, students are asked to have a physician certify that they have had “appropriate clinical treatment for transition to the reassigned sex” or are “in the process of transition.”\n\nExperts said people who are transgender often socially transition to their gender identity without medical treatment – and that is almost always the case for high school students. Gigl said it was virtually impossible for high school students to obtain some documents, like a birth certificate showing a change of gender, and difficult to obtain others.\n\nWhen the policy was written, Goodell said, the idea was to have “a liberal standard of proof” to determine gender identity and that “back then, the concept was novel.”\n\nSocietal views on the subject have changed, he said, and it is now generally understood that transgender students are expressing “an honest reflection of who they are.”\n\nThe association’s policy also allows any school to appeal the eligibility of a transgender student “on the grounds that the student’s participation in interscholastic athletics would adversely affect competition or safety.” The association said no school had made such an appeal.\n\nGigl said the appeals process would be “fraught with danger,” since it could require examining a student’s confidential record. “Who’s going to make that decision, and how would it be made?” she said. “Who has the right to go into the records?”\n\nGoodell said an appeal would be heard by a committee and kept confidential, and would take place only “if there is a legitimate issue about safety.”\n\nEmail: koloff@northjersey.com; wyrich@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/23/election-2022-ten-seek-three-seats-on-huron-valley-school-board/69496615007/", "title": "Election 2022: Ten seek three seats on Huron Valley school board", "text": "Ten candidates are seeking a 6-year term on the Huron Valley Schools Board of Education.

She works in textbook publishing.\n\nWhat makes you qualified to be a school board member and why do you want to hold that position? What do you see as the role of a school board member?\n\nDimick: I am a parent, taxpayer, and a community member. I do not like the direction public education has taken. We seem to be more concerned with gender identity and feelings than grades… we have junior high children dressing up as furries. School is a learning institution, time to refocus on education. School board members are public trustees volunteering to oversee the education system of the community, they are working in partnership with parents/guardians, educators, and administrative staff.\n\nDolley: I am a graduate of Huron Valley (MHS 2001) and a parent of three students. Keeping our schools great is deeply personal to me. I have a broad background in business, technology and the arts and will bring a fresh, analytical perspective to our district. The role of the board is to make smart decisions that better the lives of our kids. I am running to keep our schools safe, hire and retain great teachers and make sure our district is welcoming to all kids. I am proudly endorsed by our local teachers via the HVEA.\n\nDuby: I think anyone with a willingness to serve and the desire to make things better is qualified to be a school board member. I want to be a board member because I believe a good education is the foundation necessary to build a better society and I want to ensure the focus of the board is on improvements and progress. The role of a board member is to create the structure needed to realize that progress, and to evaluate and adjust the structure over time.\n\nForrest: As a former HVS para educator and teacher, HVS board member since 2018, and current board Vice-President, I understand all facets of public education and specifically what it takes to run a large district like HVS. I look forward to serving the Huron Valley Schools community for a second term and continuing advocating for all of our students. Local boards of education are charged with overseeing the education of children in their community. The Michigan Revised School Code gives the board of education the authority to educate all enrolled children and provide for the safety and welfare of these kids.\n\nGrzymkowski: Appointed to the Board in January, I’ve spent the last 7 months learning, observing, and participating in the governance of our district. Over the last 18 years, I have held volunteer positions in the classroom, on PTA Boards, and as the Bond and Sinking Fund Co-Chairperson. I hold a B.S. in Business from Oakland University, and I am employed by a local government entity that adheres to similar financial procedures and budget constraints as HVS. I seek this position because I value our school district and want to see the legacy of exceptional education continue. The Board is the governing body which provides the vision and direction, setting the tone for our community.\n\nLennis: As a Pastor of the White Lake Presbyterian Church, I have a set of skills necessary for helping people work together toward a successful common goal. My skills at leading committee meetings, conflict resolution training, and working as a team are methods for achieving those goals. I am running for the board because I believe every child deserves the same quality education, regardless of their circumstances. I believe my role as a member of the school board will be to work as a team member to help set the standards of excellence each child deserves.\n\nNagy: I am a former board member of Huron Valley Schools. During my time on the board, I was engaged in the Strategic Planning committee and was involved in the schools. I decided to run for school board again because I want to be active in the community and district again. My role as a school board member is to help set educational goals and establish policy of the school system. This is based on state laws and community values. We employ the superintendent and treasurer and hold them responsible for managing the school in accordance too our policies. We make a wide range of decisions on issues, like hiring, setting policy, planning student services and a lot more. This is not a role that has a personal agenda.\n\nPilchowski: The Board of Education’s role is intended to be the voice of the community to directly impact the student experience in the classroom by collaborating with school administration and educators. As a parent of three HVS students and a former HVS student myself, I've seen the impact this district can have on the life and futures of students in the real world. As a Senior IT Professional, I've held the responsibility of people leader, solution designer, and consensus builder to deliver multi-million-dollar projects for billion-dollar companies. I believe my depth of experience, critical thinking, and collaboration mentality will bring a positive impact to our Board.\n\nRyan: I have been an estimator and purchaser for one of the largest commercial construction companies in Michigan for over 22 years. My responsibilities as an estimator and purchaser uniquely qualify me to evaluate financial expenditures and budgeting practices. I want to work with the other board members, parents, teachers, the community, and administration to improve the quality of education for our students and work environment for our staff. As a board member, my role is to challenge administration and ask questions to ensure the decisions being made are in the best interest of the students and teachers, so our kids receive a quality education.\n\nZimmerman: ​Though I am not a politician, I am at my core an educator and a current HVS parent. My background in education; masters in secondary math and masters in school administration and supervision, gives me a unique perspective in education and schools. I was a teacher within Huron Valley Schools up until this last school year. I want to help be the change our kids and staff deserve at Huron Valley! The role of the school board is to make decisions about curriculum, school buildings and maintenance, annual budgets and more by consulting with parents, teachers, and the superintendent.\n\nAre you happy with the overall direction of the district? Why or why not?\n\nDolley: The pandemic was very challenging for our community and especially our kids. I think that Huron Valley Schools did a good job in a tough situation. The fact is we have a wonderful, family-oriented district which I have experienced as both a student and now a father. We have a solid strategic plan, great teachers and great kids. There is always more that can be done - I am particularly interested in helping non-college bound students find great careers - but our community is proud of our great schools and the good we have done these last few years.\n\nDuby: Overall I’m happy. I think we could do more for educators and support staff and we could do more to challenge students, but right now the direction we’re headed is good. Facility improvements are getting completed on schedule, students are getting back to more normal routines, and while post pandemic classroom sizes are starting to balloon, so far we haven’t seen the teacher shortages or strikes other places have.\n\nForrest: Although the past two and a half years have been challenging to navigate. I know that our board has been flexible and transparent in our decision making. We have been informed and collaborative. We proactively work with all staff, parents and all stakeholders including our students to make the best decisions for our students, focusing on both safety and growth in learning in all areas of teaching and learning.Grzymkowski: I believe our district is moving in the right direction however there is room for improvement. We have faced an incredible time of instability and erratic education. The Board’s focus must be on closing learning gaps and employee relations. These two issues will impact our ongoing success. Our students need additional support; utilizing one-time funds to address the gaps is an investment we must make. Our staff is the greatest asset of the district their work is vital, essential. Parents, administration, and the Board, we need to work creatively to demonstrate the employee’s importance.Lennis: I believe our present school board has had a very tough couple of years. Despite the COVID pandemic, they have pushed forward and continued to offer programs and opportunities for all students in the district. I believe lessons are learned each day and this district continues to do what’s best for our students.\n\nNagy: I am happy with the overall direction of the district. I think every district including ours Is working diligently to get back to business and everyday functions. I have confidence in our superintendent and feel his focus for the district is a good one.\n\nPilchowski: Through COVID and a few tough years, the current Board did an admirable job navigating unforeseen and unprecedented times. However, I do believe there is a great opportunity for the Board to offer a more impactful experience for our community and better representation for our teachers. I think we need to augment the Board with the professional experience to effectively manage diverse opinions, tough economic pressures, and the health and safety of our students and teachers.\n\nRyan: No, I am not happy with the overall direction of the district. Enrollment has dropped by 863 students since the 2018-2019 school year. The district receives a foundation allowance of $9,150 per pupil. That is $7,896,450 in missed funding. We need to make Huron Valley Schools a place parents want to send their children.\n\nZimmerman: I feel the school board in recent years has done what they felt was best. However, I think the current climate in the classroom over the past three years has significantly shifted for our students as well as our staff. Being a teacher through those years I have a perspective and can give insight others running can not.\n\nDimick: No. All educational metrics indicate a steep decline within HVS schools. We also have suffered a mass exodus of students during the “pandemic” many due to the significant government overreach. Our school board President Sean Carlson is the Deputy Executive of Oakland County, his boss is Dave Coulter- how was he ever going to challenge Oakland County mandates when they were coming from his boss? A man cannot have two masters.\n\nWhat should the school district’s priorities be coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how it spends ARPA funds?\n\nDuby: This year we should be focusing on a transitional school year as more students are coming back and anxiety levels within the student population are likely at an all time high. Emotional and mental health will need additional support from teachers and counselors as kids get back to a normal routine. ARPA funds should go toward reducing class sizes, providing food, technology, stability assistance, improving safety protocols, supporting student emotional wellbeing, and creating a more equitable school environment for all.\n\nForrest: The HVS board is working with Huron Valley staff and our Huron Valley community on our 2023-2028 strategic plan. This will guide our district as we plan and implement our improvement plans. These initiatives include recruiting and retaining teachers, safety and security, innovative programming and social emotional learning. These action items came from last year’s collaborative school and community task force.\n\nGrzymkowski: The learning gaps, if left unchecked, will compound. Utilizing pandemic funding for additional classroom supports can help close the gaps and allow students to build on a solid foundation. HVS has been hiring professionals to assist with behavior intervention. Students have experienced burnout during the pandemic, creating behaviors that are disruptive to learning. Providing strategies and healthy routines allows students to experience learning readiness. Lastly, how we compensate our staff must be evaluated so we maintain our highly qualified professionals. Turnover has a tremendous impact on our students and the effectiveness of the district.\n\nLennis: I celebrate the American Recovery Plan Act funds received by the district and the allocations already designated. I especially support the increased mental health, special education and at-risk student funding, as I recognize this is a particular need coming out of the COVID pandemic. These three areas address the deficits that children have experienced as a result of the fragmented education they have experienced in the last couple of years.\n\nNagy: I think the districts priorities should be on the social, emotional, mental health and academic needs of our students and teachers. I believe we should do everything in our power to support them. It is important to put our students and teachers first and make a difference in their lives.\n\nPilchowski: Diligence and transparency are key to building trust with the community. Defining and making tangible long-term plans with the funds, including metrics, scheduled reviews, and accountability strategies are the execution steps that ensure proper expense of any budgetary need. The first step is proper research and applicability, finding the most effective expenditures to impact our student and our teachers in the classroom, then creating the oversight to ensure these steps are fruitful.\n\nRyan: The district’s priority should be the learning loss that occurred during the pandemic. We need to focus on the 42% literacy gap and providing more resources for our special education program.\n\nZimmerman: Priorities for the district and funding should be focused on student and staff mental and physical well being and safety. We also need to reframe how we are assessing students learning. The standardized testing from pre-covid does not fit our new mold in our climate. We need to grow and help support and foster student learning in new ways.\n\nDimick: Learning loss. We have a 42% literacy gap at the 3rd grade level. That indicates almost half read at one or more grades below level. Let us put the money into education! ARPA funds have an expiration, and must be spent within the allotted time. We need to use them as a one-time funding source not incur long-term fiscal obligations based on one-time funds. Groups like “Beyond Basics” are experts at detecting and working through educational challenges.\n\nDolley: The number one funding priority must be hiring and retaining great teachers, especially with many eligible to retire in the next five years. We currently pay less than all our neighboring districts. I know it's challenging but if we can't compete to hire the best teachers, how will our kids compete out in the world? As far as ARPA funding, much of that is allocated and spent already. I would spend remaining funds at the point of learning - meaning in the classroom, helping our kids overcome pandemic related setbacks.\n\nIssues related to diversity, equity and inclusion are a recurring conversation among students, staff and the community at large. What’s one tangible action local districts can make to address diversity, equity and inclusion?\n\nForrest: Public education opens doors to all children with no exceptions and no exclusions. Educators in Huron Valley meet students, where they are when they walk through our doors. Our schools work to provide an equal educational opportunity for all of our students however diverse they may be. A safe school environment is directly related to the availability of school based resources and support, both academically and socially.\n\nGrzymkowski: Diversity, equity and inclusion means many things to many people. Keeping to just one action item, I will focus on the celebration of diversity. Our unique culture, race, nationality should not separate us but many times it does, because of preconceived ideas or lack of knowledge. I would propose having culturally specific clubs that are open to all students. A student-led club could celebrate the culture(s) through food, entertainment, special speakers, and discussions. Students would have the opportunity to participate in learning in an engaging and organic way.\n\nLennis: There needs to be a formal structure dedicated to these issues, encouraging student and community participation and respecting the differences among us.\n\nNagy: These issues are up front in all our lives. I do know and respect the actions Huron Valley Schools have taken starting way back in 2001 addressing these issues.\n\nPilchowski: Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity are incredibly important. We know the key to a solid and impactful education is an environment where people can be safe to learn and be acknowledged for who they are. A quote I often come to is that 'Diversity is not about charity.' What this means is that you aren't 'doing diversity' to check a box, you're focusing on diversity because different experiences and perspectives are important in any environment, schools being a key area here. We can focus on the whole of each person, and not just outcomes to yield fantastic results, and we can see the tangible result in this with objective measurements of happiness and engagement.\n\nRyan: I believe everyone should be respected and treated equally regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, etc.\n\nZimmerman: I feel we should include our students and parents in a task force to address the concerns and issues they are actually seeing daily in our schools. Using this feedback we can work together to come up with a tangible realistic action plan to address concerns that have come up.\n\nDimick: Treat everyone equally. Equity is a nice way of saying we want to control outcomes by offering different levels of opportunities or a sliding scale of measuring outcomes based on race, gender, or socioeconomic background. This is a terrible disservice to any group, essentially saying they need special or extra considerations to be competitive. What could be more offensive?\n\nDolley: The first thing we must do is make sure every Huron Valley classroom is welcoming and supportive of kids no matter who they are or what kind of family they come from. This starts by electing a board that values diversity and will partner with our teachers to share those values with our kids. We also need to keep our curriculum historically accurate. I went to HVS, I learned about all the triumphs and tragedies of American history and it helped shape me into who I am. I trust our kids to learn the right lessons from age appropriate instruction.\n\nDuby: Districts can evaluate demographic/socioeconomic statistics vs. disciplinary actions taken against students and address biases where correlation is found to exist. This will make sure more students are treated fairly, which will help celebrate diversity and inclusion.\n\nSchool districts saw student enrollment drop dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic to private-, charter-, home- or non-school options. With school funding tied directly to enrollment, what are your thoughts on schools of choice policies, and how would you attract new, returning students to the district?\n\nGrzymkowski: Bringing back students is a priority. How we do that is by creating a reason for them to come back. Addressing literacy, writing and core curriculum demonstrates the district’s commitment to rigorous academics. Creating secure learning environments, reimaging how we integrate technology into education, and recapturing the love of learning continues to remind parents why HVS is a great school district. Parents are making decisions based on what is best for their student; providing them with a solid reason to come back should be our goal.\n\nLennis: Let people know what HVS offers! Advertise, get creative with ways to spread the word about the district and all the positives we have to offer. Deliberate promotion of Huron Valley Schools, reaching out to surrounding communities and in our own backyard is vital.\n\nNagy: Our district is a school of choice district which I think is a good thing. Several ways to attract new and returning students it to provide a safe and secure environment. Offer challenging programs that peak student interest and provide more student choices.\n\nPilchowski: School of choice has always been an interesting subject. From accommodating parents who commute, to identifying friend-groups for students, to getting kids into schools that are performing better than others. Having this as an option is a competitive advantage to other districts without it. Parents are usually attracted to schools that offer best-in-class curriculum, facilities (including health/physical safety measures), and great teachers. We can control these by ensuring our facilities offer similar physical/health measures, great curriculum that is relevant and modern, and by continuing to hire and pay for amazing teachers who focus on community health and student happiness.\n\nRyan: I agree with the Let Kids Learn ballot initiative. I believe if a district provides a quality education, then people will not feel the need to remove their kids from the district. If we are a great district, the money will stay here. To attract new students and retain existing students, we need to offer a curriculum that is challenging and engaging. The Board of Education and Administration needs to create and maintain a transparent and reciprocal environment that acknowledges and respects the view of parents.\n\nZimmerman: Our district needs to make sure we are offering the same programs, opportunities, and supports that these other schools have that we are losing our students to. I know one area I feel we are lacking is a program for gifted students at the elementary and middle levels. I personally have looked at other options for one of my children for this reason but chose to stay in district due to emotional and friend supports for her here. This may not be the case for other families looking for an option we are unable to provide.\n\nDimick: School choice is important. Parents and stakeholders need to have a right to remove their child from a failing system. If we are a top performing district that focuses on education and not a “woke” agenda parents will be willing to consider returning to HVS.\n\nDolley: HVS enrollment has been declining for at least 10 years, and the pandemic didn’t help at all. Because this is a long term trend, we need long term thinking to reverse it. My plan is to hire more great teachers, lower class sizes and proactively pursue school choice students. I know we’ve turned some school choice kids away this year. We also need to keep HVS a welcoming and safe place so that parents know their kids belong in this district. There is no overnight fix but by making investments now we can bring new and returning families to HVS.\n\nDuby: I have to respect school of choice policies and parents’ choice when it comes to school of choice. I don’t agree with putting public funds toward private schools and I don’t agree with for-profit charters. But if a nearby school has better reputation for academics or college acceptance rates, then the best way to attract new and returning students is to make the improvements necessary to become the school of choice. Smaller class sizes, better paid staff with experience teaching good curricula, a culture of listening to students and celebrating uniqueness will make a school more desirable and increase enrollment.\n\nForrest: School of choice programs in Michigan’s State Aid School Act allow local districts to enroll non resident students in our district and count them in per pupil membership. This is very different from private and charter school options. As a public school board member, we must believe that public education is the place to educate Michigan’s school children. All of our children deserve a fair chance to get an honest, accurate, well funded quality education that provides the skills and knowledge they need to follow their dreams. This is how we attract new and returning students.\n\nWhat is an issue facing the district that isn’t on residents’ radar that should be? What steps would you take to address that issue?\n\nLennis: Teaching children the ability to think on their own, giving them problem-solving, decision-making, analysis and observation skills would address the issue of children growing into adults without critical thinking skills. This should be incorporated as an element of instruction.\n\nNagy: One issue that all districts face today is the lack of qualified teachers, para’s, substitute teachers, bus drivers, basically the personnel needed to provide and support learning. It used to be a new teacher had difficulty finding a teaching position in a school district. I don’t think expectations should be lowered but we need to find incentives to offer teachers and staff that will attract them to our district.\n\nPilchowski: A huge priority is class size, and support for additional social workers in the schools. Teachers are managing the individual needs of many students, and with the expansion of 504 and IEP plans, these teachers need extra muscle to appropriately engage all students in an equitable and reasonable way. We need to show our residents how class size and teacher involvement/attention directly impact the mental health of our students, their success in their programs, and the teachers job satisfaction and happiness. We need our community educated and advocating for our teachers with better funding, better compensation, better staffing, and better tools to give these students the attention they deserve.\n\nRyan: The lack of support of our teachers has led to teachers leaving the district. We need to ensure that the commitments administration makes to a school are followed through and happen. A formal process should be in place if a complaint is made regarding a teacher or a student. The district needs accurate training for safety if there is an active shooter. The current training in the school is insufficient. Proper training needs to be implemented that is tailored to the school as well as each teacher’s classroom.\n\nZimmerman: In my own experience, I find one area of concern is the academic loss over the past few years. Our residents know this however, they do not know the extent of it. As a high school math teacher I have seen detrimental loss to students in math. There are no remedies in place to make up for this loss and have students re-learn or learn material that they are lacking. Teachers are encourage to “pass on” students. This in the end is not helpful to the student who will then continue to struggle even more so in the next level of math (or another course). We need to do better and have a better plan for our students.\n\nDimick: One teacher I spoke with was very distraught with the plan to move three 3rd grade classes in to two 4th grades operating at max capacity. When you couple that with the significant movement of teachers to areas outside their traditional wheelhouse (which we just did with about 20-30 teachers) it is a recipe for disaster. On top of our significantly troubling academic metrics indicating a 42% literacy gap- we are setting those kids up to fail!Dolley: I am particularly passionate about helping our kids who don’t go to college. I am currently exploring options for partnerships with local employers or unions to get these kids skills and experience to start great careers right away. There is a shortage of skilled labor in Michigan, there’s no reason our HVS graduates can’t take advantage to start a great life. We need to help them make it happen!Duby: Due to how school funding laws exist now, HVS per-pupil funding is basically locked in with very little chance of being improved anytime soon. It would take a lot of effort and cooperation from everyone in Oakland County to secure additional funding that could make HVS the premier school district in the state. To address that we either need to put a county-wide proposal on a ballot that would increase everyone’s taxes to pay more for every pupil in Oakland County, or we need to lobby our state government to pass new legislation that re-evaluates how funding is allocated.\n\nForrest: School funding is an issue I have been working on for years. Michigan has been underfunding public education for years. Michigan teacher salaries dropped by 16% between fall 2009 and fall 2017. In 2019 Michigan ranked dead last nationally in education revenue growth. This year, school budget finally addresses some of these shortfalls. If we want to attract and retain teachers, reduce class sizes and implement robust programming for our students, our state legislators must continue to increase school funding and look at replacing Proposal and create a school funding model that increases and equalizes funding for all Michigan public schools.Grzymkowski: Always funding. We are currently being given one-time funding (and/or increases) to support safety and security, special education, and transportation. When these funds are exhausted what becomes of the programs we have put in place? Will these increases be permanent? Once a program is created or expanded, without categorical funding, the program must be added to the general operating budget. Here is the rub - if the foundation allowance (our main source of funding) does not grow at the same rate, where do we find the funding? We cannot sacrifice any of these programs, but how does our district continue to support these initiatives without funding? Funding continues to be an issue that we must address with our leaders in Lansing.\n\nContact reporter Susan Bromley at sbromley@hometownlife.com or 517-281-2412.

Joseph Lagana and Assembly members Lisa Swain and Chris Tully on Nov. 7.\n\nLegislative District 38 was redistricted last year, losing Passaic County's Hawthorne and gaining Teterboro, South Hackensack, Little Ferry and Moonachie. The remainder of the district includes Bergenfield, Fair Lawn, Glen Rock, Hasbrouck Heights, Lodi, Maywood, New Milford, Oradell, Paramus, River Edge, Rochelle Park and Saddle Brook.\n\n\"We believe it’s essential that we prioritize introducing Senator Lagana, Assemblywoman Swain and Assemblyman Tully to the voters in these new parts of the districts,\" Democratic campaign manager Reed Elman said. \"They are knocking on doors, talking with voters and engaging with local leaders in those towns to get a better understanding of what matters to their communities.\"\n\nThe Republicans are also bringing their campaign to the people and going door to door to make a personal connection.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"We've always believed in a simple strategy: talking to the people in our community,\" Horton said. \"I'm not a career politician; I'm a special education and applied behavioral therapist. My approach is to talk with voters daily and assure voters that I'm accessible to them year-round, not just during an election.\"\n\nIn 2021, just more than 3,400 voters — or 2.93% of the vote — separated Tully and a Republican challenger. Lagana maintained a larger margin, with 4,549, or a 7.58% lead, against his challenger.\n\nThe last time a Republican won an Assembly seat was in 2002, when Rose Marie Heck was the lone GOP winner, splitting the Assembly with a Democrat. Republicans claimed full majority in District 38 from 1992 to 2001. Since 2004, Democrats have had full control.\n\nHere's what the candidates had to say about the upcoming election:\n\nDuring your last term, what are some of your accomplishments?\n\nState Sen. Joe Lagana (D): This year I was proud to deliver for my constituents by passing a series of laws which will decrease auto theft, making all of us in New Jersey safer from crime. The legislation will increase penalties for repeat car theft offenders and tackle the issue of burglary, reducing the ability of individuals to take key fobs from homes in order to steal cars.\n\nAssemblywoman Lisa Swain (D): I’ve been proud to stand up for access to women’s health care — that’s why I was the primary sponsor of A3974, which protects women who seek reproductive health care in New Jersey from being extradited to another state. And I was deeply proud of my work to pass the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to abortion into state law.\n\nAssemblyman Chris Tully (D): “I was proud to be the primary sponsor of A4694, which was signed into law by the governor and fights back against New York’s congestion pricing scheme. We cannot afford to have our residents pick up the tab for New York’s failure to invest in their infrastructure. We’re also creating incentives for New York businesses to open offices in New Jersey closer to the families that make up their workforces.\n\nWhy are Republicans running for the state Senate or the Assembly?\n\nMicheline Attieh (R): As a mother, grandmother and educator, I'm committed to protecting our children and addressing the soaring cost of living. These past few years have been tough on families, and our current state senator, Joe Lagana, has done nothing to alleviate these challenges. In fact, he's made things worse by supporting Gov. Phil Murphy's record spending and radical green energy agenda. Lagana's support for eliminating gas-powered cars by 2035 and mandating the removal of gas appliances in homes and businesses is concerning. He's also disregarded parents by endorsing teaching subjects like gender identity in second grade. After the learning loss from COVID lockdowns, our kids deserve a better education with parental involvement at every step. I'm running to tackle these pressing issues and provide the representation our district needs.\n\nGail Horton (R): I'm running because I couldn't ignore the problems any longer. The new school curriculums, the high cost of living and rising crime rates all demand action. As an educator, I felt compelled to improve our schools. The cost of living forced my own son to leave the state. I've experienced crime myself, and I've heard similar stories from too many voters. We need change, and Micheline, Barry and I are going to bring much-needed change to District 38.\n\nBarry Wilkes (R): Truthfully, I first thought about running when Gov. Phil Murphy said, “If taxes are your issue, then we’re probably not your state,” or something to that effect. He was basically saying, “If you can’t afford to live here, you can leave, because I don’t care about you anyway.” The more I paid attention, the more I learned just how little the governor and the Lagana, Swain and Tully team care about voters. The examples of their arrogance are too numerous to count: the nonchalant attitude toward the skyrocketing cost of living in this state, discarding the Bill of Rights during COVID, the shocking treatment of our veterans at the Paramus Veterans Home, establishing school policies that essentially require teachers to withhold from parents critical information about their own children, pushing an electrification agenda that will crush the poor and middle class, and giving billion-dollar handouts to foreign companies at the expense of New Jersey residents. The list goes on and on. I am running for the opportunity to fight against all of these bad policies.\n\nIf elected, what are your goals?\n\nLagana: Mental health in schools is critical, and it will be a primary focus for me when I’m hopefully reelected this November. The pandemic only exacerbated an already worrisome trend of declining mental health for our children. As a parent of three school-age girls, this is a deeply personal issue for me. The U.S. surgeon general has called it an urgent public health crisis. With more and more kids struggling with depression and anxiety, it’s urgent we act to address the issue.\n\nSwain: First and foremost, the fight for women’s rights, reproductive freedom and menstrual equity is far from over. While the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act was a huge leap in protecting abortion access in New Jersey, I believe we must move to enshrine that right in the New Jersey Constitution to ensure that fundamental right is protected.\n\nTully: If there has been one common theme I’ve heard from voters this election, it’s concerns about affordability. We must prioritize tax cuts for all families, and especially our seniors. I’ve been proud to support measures like StayNJ, Senior Freeze and prescription drug affordability. But there is still more work to do. That’s why I’m committed to finding even more ways for our seniors to afford to retire in the same communities where they raised their families.”\n\nAttieh: In the state Senate, I'll work with Senate Republican Leader Anthony Bucco to pass a parental bill of rights, a top priority for me. I'll also focus on repealing Bill 4454, the sex ed bill passed in 2020, and reinstating COLA. Within the first few months, I aim to reduce the state budget by 10%, allowing for tax cuts and providing long-term relief for our state. Additionally, I'll redirect resources away from windmill industry bailouts that harm our sea life and toward helping families cope with soaring energy costs.\n\nHorton: When I join the Assembly this January, one of the first things on my agenda will be to prioritize cutting our record state spending and providing tax relief to hardworking families struggling to make ends meet. In the long term, my goals include passing a Parental Bill of Rights, enacting legislation to address carjackings and gang theft, and ensuring substantial and sustainable tax relief, rather than temporary election-year fixes.\n\nWilkes: Like my running mates, my priorities are: ending the anti-parent agenda of the Murphy administration, improving our schools, getting our state budget under control, redirecting excess state revenue back to municipalities to lower property taxes, and ending this absolutely ridiculous push to ban gas appliances and cars (a goal that will make us weaker, poorer and do shockingly little to reduce carbon emissions). I will also focus on supporting law enforcement and improving the business climate in this state. I want New Jersey to be a land of opportunity that our children and grandchildren want to come home to — to raise their children, to find a job or to start a business in.\n\nWhat's something you would want your constituents to know before they vote?\n\nLagana: Voters should know their vote is their voice. This will be a close election, and every vote will count. Staying home isn’t an option. And with early voting now so accessible in Bergen County, it’s easier than ever to make your voice heard. If you care about the future of our community, it’s essential that you vote.\n\nSwain: Voters should know reproductive freedom is on the ballot this year. Republicans in Trenton have already introduced new abortion bans in the state Legislature, and the New Jersey Senate Republican leader recently confirmed they plan to launch a coordinated attack on reproductive rights if they win a majority in the state Legislature. Our race in Bergen County could be the one that decides which party holds the majority, so it’s essential that everyone — and women, in particular — vote like their freedom is on the ballot, because it really is this year.\n\nTully: Right now, right-wing extremists are fighting to allow concealed guns at kids' soccer games and playgrounds. I’m a dad, and I know that my family’s safety is my first priority. I think a lot of parents in our district feel the same way. We need to stop these extremists in their tracks, and the best way we can do that is by voting for the candidates that will fight for commonsense gun safety measures.\n\nAttieh: As an educator, business owner and a mother of four children, I understand the struggles that so many New Jerseyans are facing, and I promise to fight for our citizens and taxpayers just like I would fight for my family. Once elected on Nov. 7, I promise to immediately start working to make positive changes before I am sworn in. I also promise the people of 38 to always be transparent in everything I do.\n\nHorton: I want voters to know about my work ethic, grit and determination. After I suddenly became a single mom and widow at 45, I was forced to assume my late husband's business, which was thousands in debt. I worked three jobs to hold on to our home and to be able to put our then-16-year-old through college when the time came. When in the Assembly, I will show the same work ethic and determination to make our state better for my constituents.\n\nWilkes: When elected, my top priority would be to listen and stay connected to the people. Their concerns are my concerns. All opinions should be respected and considered. You'll have an honest voice in Trenton.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}]}

Bill Pascrell (D-District 9) announced on Wednesday that his office had secured an Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program award for the Englewood Fire Department.\n\n\"America’s firefighters are our heroes on the frontlines,\" said Pascrell, who also serves on the chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. \"Their courage demands constant vigilance from our elected leaders to make sure they have every tool they need to do their jobs.\"\n\nThe AFG program was created after Pascrell’s Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 2000.

Meanwhile, another law will allow schools to use school safety funds to employ unlicensed chaplains for mental health roles, a move some critics have said could allow religious activists to recruit in schools and further polarize school communities.\n\nThe renewed emphasis on school safety came in response to the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde last year. But despite the new measures, state lawmakers didn’t listen to Uvalde parents’ calls to pass legislation that would’ve raised the minimum age to buy an AR-style rifle from 18 to 21.\n\nAll in all, experts say many of the changes will bolster school safety, but some requirements, such as for armed officers, may be challenging for public schools to implement by the upcoming school year with limited funding and staffing constraints. The legislation does not punish schools for not having an armed guard at every school.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the changes lawmakers made to school safety in Texas.\n\nWhat prompted these new laws?\n\nOver a year ago, a teenage gunman entered Uvalde’s Robb Elementary School and killed 19 children and two teachers in what became Texas’ deadliest school shooting. Seventeen people also were injured.\n\nLaw enforcement didn’t breach the classrooms the gunman had taken over for more than an hour amid lapses in communication and leadership, according to investigations by state officials and journalists. A state committee report also found “systemic failures” and missed warning signs that the gunman might have been planning a violent attack.\n\nIn response, state leaders called for boosting schools’ physical security measures to protect them against intruders and addressing student mental health.\n\nNot long after the shooting, some Texas officials, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called for placing law enforcement officers at all schools, though some law enforcement leaders at the time noted it would be challenging to fully staff and pay for such a proposal.\n\nWhat actions did state leaders take after the Uvalde shooting?\n\nAbout a month after the shooting in Uvalde, Gov. Greg Abbott and state leaders channeled $100 million toward school safety initiatives, including silent panic alert technology that was mandated by the TEA to quickly alert police whenever there’s an intruder in a school.\n\nAbbott also appointed a chief of school safety and security, a new TEA position, to serve schools and the Legislature as a security expert. He also ordered audits to see how effective schools are at detecting and stopping intruders.\n\nIn February, Abbott made school safety an emergency item for the regular legislative session, calling on state lawmakers to provide additional funding for school safety and mental health and to “use the newly created Chief of School Safety and Security to ensure compliance with all mandated school safety standards.”\n\nWhat school safety changes did the Texas Legislature make?\n\nHeeding Abbott’s call, state lawmakers passed House Bill 3. The broad legislation expands and reinforces several existing school safety efforts, like requiring mental health training for more school staff, and outlines more ways schools can use funding for school safety. The law will go into effect in September, but lawmakers gave schools some flexibility to meet the requirements for armed guards and staff mental health training.\n\nDespite the renewed focus on school safety, state lawmakers largely ignored calls from Uvalde parents for more gun regulations. During this year’s regular session, the families pushed for a bill that would’ve raised the minimum age to buy an AR-style weapon from 18 to 21. The bill saw some traction in the Legislature, but it failed to pass along with several other proposed firearm safety measures.\n\nHB 3 also creates a new safety and security department within the TEA to be led by Abbott’s appointed chief of school safety and security. That department will be tasked with monitoring school districts’ compliance with safety requirements, including the intruder detection audits ordered by Abbott. If a district fails to submit school safety information or address any concerns, the new law gives the commissioner of education the power to appoint a conservator to oversee the district’s school board and superintendent and correct the issues. The law says this corrective action would not apply to school districts that fail to have an armed officer at every school.\n\nHow will schools and the state work together to secure campuses?\n\nThe legislation also requires more cooperation between the TEA and the Texas School Safety Center, a research center at Texas State University tasked with collecting and sharing school safety information from schools and law enforcement.\n\nThe TEA and the center must work together to assess the security of school campuses at least once every four years, and set facility standards for districts at least once every five years. The legislation also directs the TEA commissioner to develop guidelines for districts to notify parents of “violent activity” that takes place or is investigated at the district, and orders the Texas School Safety Center to provide schools with resources they can hand over to parents on how to safely store their firearms.\n\nIn addition, school districts must provide the Texas Department of Public Safety and local emergency responders with maps of each school and let them conduct a walkthrough of school buildings. In counties with a population of less than 350,000 inhabitants, sheriffs also must conduct semiannual school safety meetings with local law enforcement officers, emergency responders and school leaders.\n\nThe legislation raises the amount districts receive each year for school safety expenses to $10 per student — an increase of $0.28 — and provides them with an additional $15,000 per campus.\n\nLawmakers also allocated $1.1 billion in the state budget for the TEA to award grants to help school districts pay for some school safety requirements, like silent panic alerts. School districts will first be able to apply for funds to help them meet minimum safety standards, according to the TEA. In a second cycle, grants will be offered to school districts so they can meet other identified safety needs, the agency said.\n\nThe new funding will likely not cover all the costs of implementing the new requirements, according to education associations and school safety experts. Placing an armed officer or guard at every school campus will be particularly expensive, they said.\n\n“Everyone wants to do everything possible to keep students safe, but we are very concerned about our schools’ ability to meet all of the new requirements given the limited resources that are available,” said Brian Whitley, a spokesperson for the Texas Public Charter Schools Association. He noted that charter schools are particularly worried because they can’t levy taxes to help pay for school security upgrades, unlike traditional public school districts.\n\nWill there be an armed police officer at every school?\n\nThe legislation directs school districts to have at least one armed officer at each campus during regular school hours. The officer must be a commissioned peace officer from the district’s own police department, a school resource officer from another law enforcement agency or a peace officer hired as a security officer.\n\nMany school districts already hire some internal or external police officers, but they may have to resort to alternatives, such as arming school staff or hiring private security officers, to guard all school campuses.\n\nJacksonville Independent School District police Chief Bill Avera said his district has officers stationed at each of its schools. But Avera, who also serves as vice president of the Texas School Police Chiefs Association and as a member of the Texas School Safety Center’s board of directors, acknowledged other school districts could face challenges doing so.\n\nIn addition to paying for an officer’s salaries and benefits, school districts sometimes also have to take care of equipment costs, like paying for uniforms, gear and patrol vehicles, Avera said.\n\nThe Texas Association of School Boards estimates the cost of hiring a police officer for districts could range from $80,000 to $100,000 per year, said Joy Baskin, the associate executive director of policy and legal services for TASB.\n\nAnd the pool for eligible officers is competitive amid a nationwide shortage of law enforcement job candidates, Avera said. His district, for example, has relied on retired police officers to staff its schools, he said.\n\n“It takes a minute nowadays to hire a police officer,” he said. “There's a lot of background work. There's a lot of things that have to be reviewed and checked on to ensure that (officers) are qualified, and so it’ll be interesting with all the school districts looking for officers at basically the same time.”\n\nTexas has more than a thousand traditional public school districts and almost 200 charter school operators or districts.\n\nWhat happens if school districts can’t staff their schools with police officers?\n\nThe legislation doesn’t outline penalties for school districts that don’t meet the armed officer requirement, Baskin said.\n\nIf school districts can’t staff schools with armed peace officers because of financial or staffing constraints, the legislation allows for a school board to claim a “good cause exception.” Each school board will determine what these exceptions will look like locally and must outline an “alternative security standard with which the district is able to comply,” the TEA told The Texas Tribune.\n\nAccording to the law, alternative plans can include allowing trained staff members to be armed. A new option in the school safety law approved this year is for districts to contract with a licensed private security firm that has personnel licensed to be armed, Avera said.\n\nDistricts can arm their staff members through the state-run school marshal program, which requires 80 hours of training and certification by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, or by setting their own policies — known as “Guardian Plans” — to designate specific individuals to carry firearms.\n\nIn a 2020 report from the Texas School Safety Center, 41% of the state’s more than one thousand school districts reported contracting school resource officers from other law enforcement agencies and 32% employed their own police officers, but about 70% of districts said they hired only between one and five police officers. About half of districts reported using nonlaw-enforcement security personnel, including 27.4% under Guardian Plans and 6% under the school marshal program.\n\nIn a similar 2022 report about charter school districts, 30.2% of almost 200 charter school operators in the state reported using nonlaw-enforcement security personnel, including 24.2% who hired private security.\n\nArming school staff could be less expensive than hiring police officers but still requires vetting and training under the school marshals program. The state pays for school marshal training, but that training is not always widely available, so school districts may still incur travel costs for their staff to be trained, said Craig Bessent, a school marshal in Wylie Independent School District, where he also serves as assistant superintendent of school operations.\n\n“I wish we would have had more legislative help on that, but we didn’t, so we'll just see how it plays out,” said Bessent, who is also chair of the Texas School Safety Center’s board of directors.\n\nIn addition, finding school employees who want to be armed might be hard. In the past, they have been reluctant to do so. About a month after the Uvalde shooting, a survey showed that Texas teachers do not want to take a gun to school.\n\nGiven these constraints, Bessent said school districts are “scrambling” to figure out how to follow the legislation before it is expected to go into effect in September.\n\nThe TEA said it plans to provide additional guidance, including webinars with an overview of HB 3 and school safety-related funding, within the next few weeks.\n\nDistricts will likely work to meet the requirements as soon as possible, Baskin said, but it may take some time.\n\n“I think many districts will want to stay as closely aligned to the statute as possible. In part because they do want to provide the best possible safety for students, but also in part because they would not want to be out of sync with the legal requirements if there were an emergency event,” she said.\n\nState Rep. Dustin Burrows, the Republican from Lubbock who authored the bill, did not respond to a request for comment on the rollout of the requirement.\n\nWhat are the rules around guns on campuses?\n\nSchools are generally considered gun-free zones under federal and state laws except in certain circumstances, including in the case of police officers, school marshals and individuals authorized by the school district to carry guns.\n\nA 1990 federal law bans firearms on school property or within 1,000 feet of public and private schools, but the law makes exceptions for law enforcement and individuals licensed to carry. Other exceptions in federal law include if the gun is not loaded and is locked away or if the individual has been authorized to carry a gun by the district.\n\nTexas also generally bans guns where school-sponsored activities take place, unless an individual is exempted. HB 3 clarifies that individuals allowed to carry firearms at schools but who aren’t law enforcement officers can’t carry out routine law enforcement duties unless there is an emergency that poses a serious threat of injury or death.\n\nHow will new Texas laws address student mental health?\n\nEvery school staff member who regularly interacts with students will be required to take evidence-based mental health training designed to help school staff identify signs that a student may need mental health support, which Avera said can be crucial to preventing violence.\n\nThe legislation allows school districts to stagger the training of staff to meet the requirement by the 2028-2029 school year, but Baskin said districts may work to complete the requirement sooner amid a renewed focus on student mental health, also spurred by the pandemic.\n\nSchool districts can be reimbursed by TEA for the costs of providing this training to employees, according to legislation, but schools and mental health advocates did not get a dedicated funding stream for mental health. Many expressed worries that meeting the other school safety requirements will take up most of the available funding.\n\nThe Legislature also passed a bill this session that gives schools the option to use school safety funds to pay for unlicensed chaplains to work in mental health roles. Volunteer chaplains will also be allowed in schools. Policies for chaplains in schools will be up to local school boards. Parental consent is required for school-related mental health services, including chaplains, the TEA said.\n\nAnd lawmakers boosted funding to the Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine program, which connects school districts with mental health professionals who can help identify student behavioral needs and help provide access to those services. The program is expected to receive $140 million for the next two years.\n\nDisclosure: Texas Association of School Boards and Texas Public Charter Schools Association have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Here's what comes next.\n\n“This is a down payment on what the Housing Savannah Plan called for to meet the needs of more than 21,000 residents who are housing insecure in Savannah,” he said.\n\nAnother $500,000 is being proposed for homelessness support service grants and an additional $3.1 million in HUD ARPA funds will be put to use for things such as public supportive housing and critical emergency housing.\n\nSavannah Safe\n\nVarious public safety projects, which would extend outside of just the police and fire departments, would receive $17.4 million of the total funding.\n\nMelder is recommending $1 million be used for grants for community partners, grassroots organizations and nonprofits who are working to end gun violence; another $80,000 would be put toward the newly relaunched Police Athletic Program\n\nA total of $6.4 million would be used for public safety facilities, to include a new joint public safety fire and police substation in the New Hampstead area. That funding would also give the city the flexibility to later address other public safety facilities, many of which the city leases, Melder said.\n\nMore:City of Savannah, Johnson defend actions as First Amendment lawsuit ends with injunction\n\n“We need funding dollars to be able to make facility investments that are needed in order to meet service needs and be better stewards of our taxpayer dollars,” he said.\n\nThe Savannah Police Department headquarters at the corner of Habersham Street and Oglethorpe Avenue could also get a facelift. The plan allocates $2.5 million for renovations.\n\nMelder's recommendations also call for $4.5 million for priority fire apparatus. A firefighting apparatus is any vehicle that has been customized for use during firefighting operations, which Melder said is extremely expensive but also extremely important in order for the Savannah Fire Department to continue operating at its current level.\n\nAnother $3 million is being proposed for a city-owned shopping center at 37th Street and Waters Avenue. While in the long run Melder believes the best use for the site would be a grocery store, he is currently proposing that the site become the hub for the city’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement.\n\nBack to basics\n\nJust over $14 million of the funding would be used for basic infrastructure. Melder is recommending $4.8 million for stormwater ditch maintenance, which he said is a city-wide issue.\n\nAdditionally, $600,000 would be allocated for stormwater maintenance; lane maintenance and enhanced tree pruning would receive $1.2 million; and revenue loss recovery, $1.7 million.\n\nA litter prevention and collection program would receive $1 million and about $300,000 would go toward two new knuckle boom trucks, which are used to collect yard and bulk items, bringing the city’s fleet to four. That allocation would also cover staff needed to support the additional operations. About $350,000 would be put toward recycling program equipment, including trucks and additional staff.\n\nStormwater meter modernization would see just over $4.3 million. Currently the city is several cycles behind in its water meter billing. One reason is because it’s \"incredibly tedious\" work to read meters by hand across the district, Melder said.\n\n“This investment brings Savannah and this program a little bit farther into the 21st century by investing in new technology that doesn't require an actual physical reading but that reading is automatically delivered from the machine to the billing department,” he said, adding that the budget also includes complementary investments for water meter staff to help get the service back on track.\n\nCity Hall notebook:More than $4 million in contracts approved by Savannah City Council\n\nNeighborhoods and people\n\nMelder is proposing that just under $16 million be invested in Savannah's neighborhoods and households. The United Way of the Coastal Empire would receive a $1 million contribution and $1.45 million in community partnerships contributions.\n\nFamily support initiatives would receive $500,000 and the Early Childhood Learning Center planned for the east side would be allocated $1 million. Approximately $6 million in SPLOST funds are earmarked for construction of the learning center, which voters approved in 2019, with equal amounts coming from both the City of Savannah and Chatham County.\n\nMore:Savannah State formally welcomes 14th president during investiture ceremony\n\nOn the southside $4 million would be put towards a new community center. Another $4 million would go toward recreation projects across the city including several projects in Daffin Park such as overhauling the dog park and resurfacing basketball and tennis courts.\n\nAnother $4 million would go toward continuing Tide to Town, which consists of almost 30 miles of protected walking and bicycling trails throughout Savannah.\n\n\"It's a a wonderful asset that really can improve connectivity and also improve transportation options for people across the city,\" Melder said of the trail network.\n\nThe ARPA funding is the backbone of the city's fiscal year 2022 budget, Melder said.\n\n\"I think it makes this a very, very exciting budget, but what also makes this very, very exciting budget is that we've had a stronger than expected economy,\" he told council.\n\n\"And so we don't have to spend ARPA on paying ourselves back or our reserves back. We can spend all of ARPA on things that are going to benefit our community. So we're really pleased to be in that position.\"\n\nKatie Nussbaum is the city and county government reporter for the Savannah Morning News. Contact her at knussbaum@savannahnow.com.

The city aims to test 2% of the population by this week's end.\n\nStay on top of the latest COVID-19 news:Click here to subscribe to elpasotimes.com.\n\nCity working to expand COVID-19 testing partnerships\n\nThe El Paso Department of Public Health is partnering with local school districts to open test sites at district facilities. Together, those sites will be able to test up to 1,000 people a day, D'Agostino said.\n\nThe city is also working to launch a public-private partnership with CVS Pharmacy to open drive-thru COVID-19 test sites at select stores, similar to the partnership unveiled with Walmart last week, in addition to partnering with University Medical Center of El Paso to increase testing in rural parts of the county.\n\nMore:Escobar says El Paso lags in coronavirus testing, warns minority community vulnerable\n\nCARES funds will reimburse the University of Texas at El Paso for its assistance testing COVID-19 samples from the city's drive-thru test sites, which D'Agostino said will enable the El Paso Department of Public Health Laboratory to process up to 500 samples in an 8-hour period.\n\nThe money will cover the hiring of additional public health workers to assist with contract tracing, which involves identifying those who have come in contact with an infected person.\n\nIt will help expand antibody testing to determine how many El Pasoans were previously infected with the virus without knowing it. Antibody testing for first responders and health care workers began May 4, city spokeswoman Laura Cruz Acosta said.\n\nIn addition to boosting testing, CARES funds will support city efforts to train local businesses and workplaces on proper disinfection and social distancing practices so El Paso can \"get back into an opening phase that's responsible,\" D'Agostino said. That includes ensuring businesses have sufficient personal protective equipment for employees, such as face masks and gloves.\n\nThe federal funds will also help El Paso prepare for the upcoming flu season, which can already strain hospitals. If the county experiences a resurgence of COVID-19 cases this winter, coronavirus patients paired with flu patients could overwhelm hospitals. To mitigate this, the city plans to offer flu vaccinations at its COVID-19 test sites with the goal of immunizing \"everyone\" against the flu, D'Agostino said.\n\nCARES funds to help with community and economic recovery\n\nThe council approved spending the remaining $34.8 million of CARES funds on community and economic assistance programs.\n\nOfficials will allocate $16.4 million for \"community response and recovery programs\" and $18.4 million for \"economic response and recovery programs.\"\n\nMore:COVID-19 layoffs: El Paso workers, businesspeople struggle with new economic realities\n\nThe $16.4 million will be used, in part, for rental, mortgage and utility assistance, in addition to supporting food banks and rehousing programs for residents who have been displaced. These programs will be enhanced by a $4.1 million federal Community Development Block Grant and $500,000 federal Emergency Shelter/Solutions Grant.\n\nThe $18.4 million will help expand city grant programs for small business owners seeking assistance with rent, utilities, supplies and inventory, and to help businesses access personal protective equipment and technology needed for remote work.\n\nNicole Ferrini, the city's chief resilience officer, emphasized during Tuesday's council meeting that the city will not administer any of the CARES funds for community recovery programs, but instead direct the monies to local service providers.\n\n\"We are a pass-through for federal funds,\" Ferrini said of the city's role in distributing CARES funds.\n\nThe next step, following council's approval of the overall funding allocations, is to notify community agencies and front-line service providers of the available community recovery funds they can apply for, Ferrini said. The city council will give the final approval to organizations city staff selects to receive parts of the $16.4 million.\n\nCommunity leaders call for creation of Fund for Common Good\n\nNearly 20 people addressed the council during public comment Tuesday to request the council set aside at least $12 million of CARES funds for a Fund for the Common Good for immigrant households.\n\nThe CARES Act excluded unauthorized immigrants as well as their U.S. citizen or legal immigrant spouses and children from receiving stimulus checks, small business loans, paid leave and unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nMelissa Lopez, the executive director of Diocesan Migrant & Refugee Services, Inc., estimated 26,000 families and 54,000 individuals in El Paso were excluded from this aid.\n\n\"Providing cash assistance is best because every single family's needs are going to be different,\" Lopez said of her support for the Fund for the Common Good.\n\nThe El Paso state legislative delegation also sent council members a letter Monday stating its support for such a fund, which reads many of those excluded \"work in essential sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, such as hospitality and food service.\"\n\nFollowing public comment the city manager stated organizations that support El Paso's immigrant community would not be not be excluded from receiving community recovery CARES Act funds.\n\n\"We are not turning anyone away,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nMolly Smith may be reached at 915-546-6413; mksmith@elpasotimes.com; @smithmollyk on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2018/06/10/noblesville-shooting-raises-questions-safety-indiana-schools/678723002/", "title": "Noblesville shooting raises questions about safety in Indiana schools", "text": "Two weeks ago, all the \"what if\" conversations Hoosiers have been having since a devastating shooting in Parkland, Fla., came into terrifying focus.\n\nA 13-year-old walked into a science classroom at Noblesville West Middle School with two hand guns and opened fire, police say.\n\nCommunities throughout Indiana — and the country — that were re-examining the safety of their schools and calling on those in positions of power to do more had one more reason to call for action.\n\nHarden school security. Provide more support. Increase funding. Strengthen gun laws. Arm teachers.\n\nBefore the Noblesville shooting, such calls were often met with a reassurance that Indiana was already doing more than most.\n\nState leaders used the days and weeks following the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to highlight the state’s school safety grant program, its safety academy and existing requirements that school districts have a trained safety specialist and up-to-date safety plan in place.\n\nToo late:Noblesville parents wanted more security. Then a school shooting happened.\n\nFighting for his job:Brownsburg teacher says transgender name policy for students goes against his religious beliefs\n\nPolitical answers? Get the latest political news on education and other key issues from IndyStar's Hoosier Politics newsletter.\n\nLast month, lawmakers passed a school safety bill that boosted the grant fund by $5 million and added a requirement that the Department of Education audit all safety plans this year. Previously, it had randomly selected around 60 to review each year.\n\nThen, Noblesville happened.\n\nSeventh-grader Ella Whistler was shot seven times and will face a long road to recovery. Science teacher Jason Seaman was also shot as he intervened to stop the shooting.\n\nEveryone, from parents and teachers to law enforcement, agrees it could have been much worse.\n\nSo, how well did the school’s safety plan work? How integral were the $120,000 in state school safety grant funds that Noblesville had received since 2014?\n\nWe don’t know.\n\nState law exempts safety plans from public disclosure.\n\nAnd the millions of public dollars funneled to schools for safety initiatives? Those, too, are exempt. The Department of Homeland Security, which administers the grant program, has released the award amounts given to districts each year but nothing more.\n\nIn response to public records requests for details about how Noblesville spent its safety grant dollars, DHS said: “Details about specific applications, budgets, approvals and plans for individual school districts are withheld from public disclosure.”\n\nState officials say they don't want would-be bad actors to know the details of schools' safety plans, response procedures and what deterrents might already be in place.\n\nStill, communities are shaken. Kids are afraid.\n\nEveryone is looking for answers that most experts agree may not exist. It’s impossible to eliminate all instances of school violence, though there are ways to mitigate risk.\n\n“It’s a very complex issue,” said John Shales, co-founder of BluePoint Alert Solutions, which makes emergency response systems for schools. “We're going to learn a lot that makes it better for our communities.\n\n“But can we get to a point of preventing all of them? I’d love to get there, but it seems like it’s a pretty tall mountain to get over at the moment.”\n\nNot only is there likely no foolproof way to prevent a student — or anyone else, for that matter — from bringing a gun into a school, but it can be difficult to know how much schools are doing to prevent such incidents.\n\n\"There is no time to waste\"\n\nWhile anyone who works in education will say that school safety is a constant focus, public conversations about the topic tend to be cyclical. They bubble up in the immediate aftermath of school shootings and then quiet down in the days and weeks that follow.\n\nThose conversations started again in February, after the Parkland shooting that left 17 dead. Noblesville was one of many communities having those conversations.\n\nIn response, the district held a public forum to seek input.\n\nAt the same time, Indiana's lawmakers began touting the many things the state already does to ensure it has safe schools: the safety plans, and specialists. The free training.\n\nOn March 9, Gov. Eric Holcomb sent a leader to legislative leaders, commending Indiana's leadership on school safety and requesting another $5 million be added to the state's $10 million school safety grant fund.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" he wrote in the letter's close.\n\nLess than three months later, police say a 13-year-old student entered Noblesville West Middle School armed and opened fire in his classroom. Court documents indicate the suspect used a .22-caliber handgun in the shooting and also was in possession of a .45-caliber handgun and a knife.\n\nJason Seaman, a seventh-grade science teacher, was shot three times and is credited with helping to stop the attack. He was released from the hospital the following day.\n\nElla Whistler, 13, was shot seven times and suffered broken bones to her neck, ribs and jaw, collapsed lungs and a severed vertebral vein, her family said this week in a written statement. She remains hospitalized in \"stable\" condition.\n\nWhat prompted the shooting and exactly what occurred in the classroom are still unclear. Authorities have released few details.\n\nOne prominent lawmaker is already calling on the state do to more. House Minority Leader Terry Goodin, D-Seymour, issued a letter this week calling on the General Assembly to add a permanent school safety commission to the legislature’s roster of summer study groups.\n\n“Recently the fears of every Hoosier parent, teacher, student and school administrator were realized when an active shooter incident happened in Indiana,” Goodin wrote in the letter addressed to the legislature. “This should be a wakeup call for the leaders of Indiana to do more.\n\n“Even though our state is on the leading edge in the nation in regards to School Safety, we still need to do more.”\n\nGregg Doyel: As Noblesville hero Jason Seaman heals, a community heals with him\n\nStepping up:Meet a student who helped raise $100K for Jason Seaman after shooting\n\nAt a news conference in the shooting's aftermath, Holcomb pledged to provide whatever resources are needed but also argued that the state’s focus on school safety plans and resources is working. In fact, he said it played a key role in preventing additional carnage in Noblesville, though he declined to provide details.\n\n“It is making a difference,” he said of the state’s school safety funding. “It did today. I am convinced it saved lives.”\n\nHow is unclear, though. The amount that schools receive from the grant program is public — Noblesville has received more than $120,000 since 2014 — but what they do with it is not.\n\nOfficials with Noblesville Schools declined to provide details about its safety plan or how it spent that grant money, but said it's active shooter response system made a difference at West Middle School. The district uses a system called ALICE, which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.\n\n\"Our ALICE system and the related training/practice in particular is a key part of why we did not have a worse outcome on May 25,\" said Marnie Cooke, spokesperson for the district.\n\nCooke said the district expects to announce recommendations for safety enhancements next week.\n\nLooking for a school safety model\n\nEven before the incident in Noblesville, worried parents across the country were looking to another Indiana school for answers.\n\nIt's been almost five years since Southwestern High School near Shelbyville unveiled an extreme active shooter defense system that had some calling it the \"safest school in America.\" The system is designed to thwart an active shooter by using cameras with a direct feed to the county sheriff's office, panic buttons for teachers and smoke cannons in hallways.\n\nBut, despite continued concerns over school shootings, it remains an anomaly.\n\nJuvenile law:After Noblesville shooting, Indiana joins other states grappling with juvenile laws\n\nPlea for patience:Attorney for Noblesville school shooting suspect asks for 'patience and privacy'\n\nThere are several likely reasons. First and foremost: the cost.\n\nFive years ago, the system had a $400,000 price tag. And that's for a relatively small school.\n\nScaled up for the largest high school in the state — the 1-million-square-foot Carmel High School — for example, \"it would cost millions,\" said Chuck McCormick, a Partner Alliance for School Safety steering committee member.\n\nEven at $400,000, equipping every school in the state with such a system would cost in the realm of $750 million.\n\nFor perspective, the state increased school safety funding by $5 million. Typically, the state spends about $10 million per year, which is in the form of matching grant funds typically used to hire school resource officers — police officers who work in schools — and safety equipment.\n\nSouthwestern High School received two matching grants from the state to install the system, and the security system provider, Net Talon, paid the difference, said Don Jones, president of the Virginia company.\n\nNot every school has those opportunities and such systems might not make sense in all school settings.\n\n4 reasons:Why all schools aren't like the 'safest school in America'\n\nReflections on Noblesville school shooting:Our schools shouldn't be war zones\n\nAnother solution many have been calling for in the wake of the Noblesville incident is metal detectors at school entrances.\n\nRelatively few schools actually use metal detectors on a regular basis. Schools may start looking more closely at them after Noblesville, but many school officials say they’re just not practical in all cases.\n\n\"Think about the reality of having metal detectors at a school the size of 4,200 students like Ben Davis,\" said Jeff Butts, superintendent of Wayne Township Schools. Wayne is home to Ben Davis High School, one of the largest in the state. \"The number of resources that would take … we struggle now to fill custodial positions, bus drivers, those types of things.\"\n\nThe manpower needed to staff the entrances, though, and training to properly use metal detectors is the least of Butts' concerns.\n\n\"What I'm concerned about is if we put metal detectors at our entrances … think of having all of our students standing in one great big group outside the school,\" he said. \"That's the perfect location for something very bad to happen, as opposed to getting all the students in the school house and getting them to their classrooms.\"\n\n\"Everyone's kind of looking for a magic wand\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that hardening schools is the best solution to prevent shootings, either.\n\nMany advocacy groups are clamoring for tighter gun laws with hopes that such approaches would keep guns out of schools and lessen the need for buttoning up schools.\n\nBeth Sprunger is a Hamilton County parent of an 8-year-old and 4-year-old. She’s also a leader of the Indiana chapter of Moms Demand Action, a group that advocates for changes to state and national gun laws. Moms Demand Action will continue to focus its efforts, Sprunger said, on strengthening gun laws, rather than hardening school buildings.\n\nOther groups, such as the National Rifle Association, have called for more armed guards in schools or even arming teachers. Indiana is one of several states that already allows for arming teachers or administrators, at the discretion of individual school boards.\n\nSprunger said she has friends with kids in Nobesville schools. There's been a lot of outcry, she said, for metal detectors and other \"target hardening\" techniques in the days since the shooting there. Still, she's not convinced that's the answer.\n\n\"The research is still out on whether or not those techniques will actually work or not,\" she said. \"Also, I'm not sure how that will effect the learning environments for those students.\"\n\nBill Payne is CEO of Fanning Howey, an architecture and engineering firm specializing in the design of learning environments with offices in Indiana and Ohio, said safety is a part of every school design these days but it needs to be balanced with the core function of schools.\n\n\"We all want to make school buildings safer, but at the same time we don’t want to lose the nurturing environment we want our students to learn in,\" Payne said. \"Those two seem like they could be in conflict at times.\"\n\nEven with unlimited resources, he said it's unlikely schools could prevent 100 percent of attacks.\n\nIt’s a harsh reality. But it’s the one that David Woodward, the Indiana Department of Education's director of school building security, lives in.\n\n\"Everyone's kind of looking for a magic wand,\" Woodward said. \"School safety has to be a comprehensive approach.\"\n\nHe said that should include infrastructure, training for students and staff, mental health supports and more.\n\n\"It can’t just be SROs (school resource officers), equipment for target hardening, mental health,\" he said. \"It has to be all of these things done well, and it has to result in a well-trained staff and student body.\"\n\nWoodward said that most schools are already doing some combination of these things. Much of it is outlined in the private safety plans. Whether those plans are robust enough, though, is a judgment left to the department. The privacy of the security plans is a safety mechanism, too, Woodward said.\n\n\"Let's say you’re someone who wants to do harm to someone else,\" he said. \"It's not good that the person who would do harm knows what all of your responses would be.\"\n\nThose plans are audited by the Department of Education, but not every year. The department randomly selects roughly 60 districts to audit each year.\n\nThat will change. New legislation, passed in the wake of Parkland, will require the department to audit all schools (though the results will also be withheld from the public).\n\nSo how can students, teachers and parents evaluate how well their schools are doing on safety? How can the public evaluate if millions of taxpayer dollars dedicated to safety grants are being well spent?\n\nAsk questions, Woodward said. Without asking for details, parents can ask administrators for general information about a school's approach to safety, training, school climate and more.\n\n“Have those conversations with school administrators,” he said. “They want to do the best job they possible can.”\n\nTim Swarens:America's nightmare shatters Noblesville's security\n\nCall IndyStar education reporter Arika Herron at (317) 444-6077.

JB Pritzker and GOP challenger Darren Bailey campaigned in downstate Illinois Tuesday to talk public safety.\n\nBailey, a state senator from Xenia, held a Tuesday afternoon press conference at the Crowne Plaza in Springfield where he again castigated Pritzker for rising crime rates and for \"handcuffing\" law enforcement in their response.\n\n\"We won't have peace in Illinois until we fire JB Pritzker,\" he said, standing before a backdrop of law enforcement officers.\n\nWith nine weeks remaining before the election, Bailey turned attention during much of the press conference to Jan. 1, 2023, when the SAFE-T Act ending cash bail will go into effect.\n\nNo cash bail practically already exists in Chicago, Bailey said, a city that has been a major flashpoint of his throughout the campaign. If elected governor, the Republican lawmaker wants to repeal the act as one of his law enforcement priorities.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"When (Cook County State's Attorney) Kim Foxx refuses to prosecute, essentially, no cash bail already exists now,\" he said, calling her, Pritzker, and Mayor Lori Lightfoot the \"three musketeers of crime, chaos, and tragedy.\"\n\n\"When this is released all across the state, the whole state is going to face the same mayhem that Chicago has.\"\n\nMore:Springfield eligible for state funding to confront gun violence\n\nWhile Bailey has received an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, Pritzker's campaign has previously noted that Bailey voted against the 2023 fiscal budget which included major investments in law enforcement.\n\nIncluded in that $45.98 billion budget are a $10 million investment in a law enforcement retention grant program and $8 million for equipment replacement.\n\n“Bailey’s refusal to own up to the votes he’s taken against supporting law enforcement, coupled with his lack of real solutions and support for those who rioted on January 6th, shows you exactly the kind of “leader” he is –– one who can’t take accountability, no matter what,” a spokesperson for the campaign said in a released statement.\n\nResponding to questions about his voting record Tuesday, Bailey blamed the bill's amendment process saying the Democrat super-majority General Assembly works into the morning hours before giving candidates very little time to review amended legislation.\n\nPritzker started his day in East St. Louis announcing a new home for the Illinois State Police Metro East Regional Headquarters -- a 62,500 square foot facility using approximately $55 million of the state's $45 billion Rebuild Illinois capital plan.\n\nThe governor's office said the building will be strategically-located to address public safety and to boost business investment in the area.\n\n\"It reflects what this region and all of Illinois deserve: communities where public safety works so all of our families can thrive,\" the governor told the crowd at the Jackie Joyner Kersee Center on Tuesday morning.\n\nCommunities like East St. Louis and Springfield also will be beneficiaries of a portion of $100 million in state anti-violence funding Pritzker announced last week. Non-profits and local governments in 16 municipalities with high rates of gun violence can apply for funding part of the Reimagine Public Safety Act.\n\nOver three years, RSPA will dedicate about $240 million to boost youth development and violence prevention throughout the state.\n\nContact Patrick Keck: 312-549-9340, pkeck@gannett.com, twitter.com/@pkeckreporter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/07/fayetteville-how-millions-funding-american-rescue-plan-act/9468706002/", "title": "How will Fayetteville use $40M funding from American Rescue Plan ...", "text": "Fayetteville is trying to stretch the once-in-a-lifetime funding it received from the federal government, and Assistant City Manager Adam Lindsay has a plan: use these restricted dollars to pay for the city’s needs and free up unrestricted dollars to go after other federal grants.\n\nLindsay called the American Rescue Plan Act “unprecedented” during the Fayetteville City Council work session on Monday.\n\n“The opportunities and needs we have are aligned in a way that we will probably never see again in our lifetimes,” he said. “If we spend the dollars in a strategic way.”\n\nFayetteville will receive around $40.4 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds in two installments: one in May 2021 and one in May 2022. It must allocate the money by December 2024 and spend it by December 2026.\n\nThat is a tight timeline, especially if the city were to start projects with ARP funds. Instead, Lindsay is suggesting using the federal dollars to fund projects that the city has already identified, or even started. That way the city can dedicate previously allocated money to pay for federal grants.\n\n\"Two million can turn into 10 million dollars,” Lindsay said.\n\nThe City Council unanimously supported implementing this strategic plan for its ARP funds.\n\nCurrently, the city is considering allocating $15 million of its ARP funds as follows:\n\n$500,000 for business assistance loans\n\n$500,000 for commercial corridors grants\n\n$1 million for childcare and daycare assistance\n\n$1 million for small business development grants\n\n$2 million for small business retention grants\n\n$4 million for a housing trust fund for affordable housing\n\n$1 million for a community hub\n\n$1.3 million for first floor renovations of City Hall\n\n$150,000 for picnic shelter replacements and refurbishments\n\n$650,000 for Rosemary Drive drainage improvements\n\n$2.75 million for Tryon Drive drainage improvements\n\n$150,000 for American Disabilities Act compliance issues\n\n$5 million for administrative initiatives\n\nLindsay added that the city is “easily” looking at more than $150 million in projects.\n\nFlooding fixes\n\nOne potential project that will cost millions of dollars is flooding mitigation across the city. The city has commissioned several watershed studies to determine the areas of greatest need and the best options for fixing them.\n\nCity staff on Monday requested $8.8 million to lessen flooding effects at Locks Creek. However, this money only addresses 25-year storm events (Hurricane Matthew was a 500-year storm, and Hurricane Florence was a 1,000-year storm) and doesn’t completely prevent flooding.\n\nMayor Mitch Colvin called this idea a “partial fix” that would still allow the flooding of homes.\n\nSheila Thomas-Abat, public services director, replied that any plan to try to address flooding in Locks Creek was “fighting nature” because it was in a flood plain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency does not qualify Locks Creek as a flood plain, but the city is submitting documentation to change that designation.\n\nThomas-Abat added that if the area had been a registered flood plain, then there would have been more restrictions about building homes there.\n\n“This is the most dangerous element,” said Mayor Pro Tem Kathy Jensen. “It always wins.”\n\nIn December, the City Council allocated $150 million for infrastructure improvements to help mitigate flooding. City staff requested $8.8 million on Monday, will request $12 million in a few months, and is planning to request even more next year.\n\nCity staff added that addressing flooding at all watersheds in the city could cost around $500 million.\n\nThat means that residents will soon see a rate increase, although Thomas-Abat did not specify the amount.\n\n“We don’t want to raise fees and we don’t want to raise taxes, but sometimes it’s necessary,” said Councilman Larry Wright.\n\nCapital and technology improvement plans\n\nUsing funds the city currently has, city staff also presented projects that could be feasible for the budgets of fiscal years 2023 to 2027.\n\nThe capital projects include:\n\n$22.7 million for a consolidated car rental facility; general aviation hangar development; perimeter road paving and fencing replacement; and taxiway pavement and lighting rehabilitation at the airport.\n\n$3.6 million for a commercial corridor revitalization program; a day resource center and emergency shelter; and support infrastructure for redevelopment area.\n\n$3.3 million for ADA compliance fixes; building maintenance; finance remodeling; operations center feasibility study; parking lot resurfacing and Ramsey Street pump station replacement.\n\n$23.6 million for Blounts Creek Trail; Cape Fear River Park; Cape Fear River trail and botanical garden extension; Mable C. Smith Park improvements; Makerspace; Martin Luther King Jr. Park; McArthur Sports Field Complex; picnic shelter replacements and refurbishing; playground repairs and refurbishing; Senior Center East and Sherwood Park Recreation Center.\n\n$550,000 for 911 dispatch consoles and temporary fire station #18.\n\n$48.75 million for watershed studies, drainage assistance program, spot repair program and easements project management.\n\n$1.1 million for Grove Street facility improvements, shelters and benches, sidewalks and ADA accessibility.\n\n$46.1 million for Blanton Road extension; bridge preservation program; College Lakes dam; dam safety and preservation program; downtown streetscape; Hinsdale Road reconstruction; intersection improvements; Mirror Lake Drive dam; multi-use lanes; municipal agreements with the North Carolina Department of Transportation; pavement preservation program; sidewalk improvements and thoroughfare street lighting.\n\nThe technology projects include:\n\n$6.8 million for security and infrastructure, including public safety camera replacements.\n\n$483,000 for business intelligence and data analysis.\n\n$4.9 million for software services, including body camera upgrades, Taser replacements, rapid DNA technology and a drone.\n\n$175,000 for city wireless expansion project.\n\nHowever, there is still $151.2 million in projects that city staff did not include in their capital and technology improvement plans for the next five years. These include public safety facilities; street, sidewalk and trail enhancements; an indoor aquatic center; phase two of City Hall renovations; and a cycling and derby park.\n\nCouncilman Antonio Jones said that he would also like to add to the list of potential projects a green space in the Murchison Road corridor near Shaw Road.\n\nOverall, the city will be able to pay for many projects, thanks to Lindsay’s strategy with ARP funds. Overall, Lindsay's strategy allows for the city to pay for any projects with ARP funds.\n\n“We are multiplying the benefit to our citizens if we use those funds to cover the costs with projects that we have identified are eligible and use the grant matching potential from the money we’ve freed up,” said Kelly Olivera, budget and evaluation director.\n\nReporter Ivey Schofield can be reached at ischofield@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/passaic/clifton/2018/08/21/clifton-nj-safer-grant-staff-third-permanent-ambulance/1032300002/", "title": "Clifton NJ wants to use SAFER grant to staff third permanent ...", "text": "CLIFTON — The city has been awarded a $455,000 federal grant it wants to use to get a third ambulance on its streets permanently.\n\nThe SAFER grant, or Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, which will be paid out over three years, can only be used to add personnel to the fire department, said city Manager Nick Villano.\n\nThe grant will be enough to hire four firefighters who \"can operate the third ambulance 100 percent,\" Villano said.\n\nWhen he announced the grant, 9th District Democrat Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr., said the additional hires will bring the department's staffing to the highest in 25 years.\n\n“This award, and others, is pivotal to making sure that our communities can retain and expand their fire services,” Pascrell said.\n\nMore:Juveniles arrested in Paterson, Clifton killings likely to be tried as adults, experts say\n\nMore:First woman firefighter to be promoted to lieutenant in Clifton\n\nFirefighters in Clifton also serve as emergency medical technicians, and due to the low staffing, officials said, it has been difficult to operate a third and much-needed full time ambulance. When the two full time ambulances are out on calls, additional calls are responded to through a mutual aid agreement with neighboring departments.\n\nClifton also received a $1.73 million SAFER grant in 2015.\n\nThe 2015 grant allowed for the restoration of 11 department positions cut in 2009 to trim the budget.\n\nThe recent grant will bring the department to 143 firefighters, one short of the highest staffing level.\n\n\"This is the grant we were waiting for,\" Clifton Mayor James Anzaldi said. \"The additional manpower should bring us to our goal.\"\n\nCouncilmen Peter Eagler and Bill Gibson were more guarded in their response.\n\n\"Hiring four firefighters is great and on paper looks good and some will say this will allow us to implement the third ambulance, but it's the minimum manpower per shift that is the important fact,\" Gibson said.\n\nChief Kevin McCarthy agreed with Gibson's analysis. In order for three ambulances to be in rotation, the department must have 28 firefighters working each shift, he said.\n\nA typical shift consists of seven engines each staffed with three firefighters, one deputy chief and two medical technicians per ambulance.\n\nWhen the number drops below 28 the third ambulance is taken out of rotation.\n\nThere are four 24-hour shifts, McCarthy said, and even with 143 firefighters, it's not guaranteed there will be 28 firefighters on duty each shift depending on retirements, sick days and vacation time.\n\nThe four additional firefighters will improve the level of service and safety for the city's residents and firefighters, McCarthy said.\n\nThe department, in the midst of hiring, will now hire 10 rather than six. The Oct. 1 new hires will be ready to hit the streets in January following training.\n\n\"It is a win for us,\" Eagler said. \"It is after all government money coming back to us and it is better if it comes to Clifton.\"\n\nHe added that $455,000 is almost a full tax point. To the average homeowner that is about $17 per year they stand to save because of the grant.\n\nIt is one of many grants that Pascrell, who co-chairs the House Fire Services Caucus, has procured for the city.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, the Clifton Fire Department has received just under $3.9 million through the Assistance to Firefighter grants and the SAFER programs.\n\nEmail:fagan@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2018/07/27/montgomery-county-commission-district-8-ron-sokol-tangi-smith/853021002/", "title": "Commissioner Sokol shares ways to improve public safety", "text": "Two candidates are running for Montgomery County Commission, District 8, which covers a portion of Fort Campbell, then from Fort Campbell to Allen Road, and from the state line to Tiny Town Road,\n\nRon Sokol has represented District 8 since 2002. He chairs the Jail and Juvenile Committee, Building and Codes Committee and Beer Board. Sokol holds an associate's in criminal justice from the University of Kentucky and a bachelor's in public administration from Austin Peay State University. He is a retired first sergeant from the U.S. Army, served as a Montgomery County magistrate and was a Tennessee parole officer before retiring.\n\nTangi Smith is a 10-year resident of the district, an Army veteran and a military spouse.\n\nSokol, a Republican, responded to Leaf-Chronicle questions on these key issues. Smith, a Democrat, declined to answer and didn't provide a photograph.\n\nSchools\n\nWhat should the county do to address ongoing school growth needs?\n\nSokol: I and other commissioners have been concerned over school growth issues for some time and student populations per each school zone. However, all decisions of when, where and type of new school construction is solely made by the Clarksville-Montgomery County School Board. The commission can only approve funding requests as presented by the CMCSS. So far all funding requests, whether for construction, equipment or school buses, have been approved. We have also enabled funding through a private act allowing revenue to be generated off the vehicle renewal fees and would certainly look at any other sources of revenue allowed by state laws.\n\nDowntown\n\nWhat should the county’s role be in downtown Clarksville revitalization?\n\nSokol: Montgomery County’s role in the downtown revitalization is to encourage private enterprises to come in and create new neighborhoods and commercial districts through incentives and special tax considerations. An example is the Commons park downtown, which became an incentive for new construction. Austin Peay State University is also making an effort to expand their campus further downtown. This enterprise resulted in $167 million in property transactions and increased tax revenues on properties that were underutilized or vacant for years. Along with easing construction restrictions and other burdensome rules is inviting business to come back to the center of Clarksville.\n\nPublic safety\n\nHow should we address the increasing need for funding for law enforcement, EMS and fire protection?\n\nSokol: We have to support public safety. Of course Montgomery County would have to continue funding any requests but also look for other sources of revenues like grants, pilot programs, and contracts with other agencies, federal and state. One way to increase dollar efficiency is to reduce the amount of lost court costs and fees, look for better health care and provided services contracts for the sheriff’s office and EMS. Other than county allocations, grants and funded training programs should be continually looked for. Fire protection at this point is voluntary, but a regular department would have to be created in the future when it can be properly supported. Like all public services, increasing taxes would be the only way to increase funding.\n\nFOR MORE\n\nThe Montgomery County election is Aug. 2.\n\nReach Chris Smith at chrissmith@theleafchronicle.com or 931-245-0282 and on Twitter @cssmithwrites.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/27"}]}

There's a demand and a need for someone like me coming out of left field.\"\n\nWalker, ironically enough, did come out of left field or at least a field of candidates on the left.\n\nHe first garnered attention in Delaware in 2016 when he joined a crowded field of six candidates running in the Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat then held by John Carney, who was elected governor that year. Walker finished fifth in that contest, garnering fewer than 3,200 votes.\n\nLargely written off as an also-ran, he stunned the political establishment this year by running as a Republican and knocking off the Delaware GOP's preferred candidate Lee Murphy in the primary before winning nearly 36 percent of the vote in the general election.\n\nThe state Republican Party, which disavowed him after the primary, seemed relieved by this latest turn of events.\n\n\"I think that is a very interesting decision for him,\" GOP vice chairwoman Emily Taylor said of Walker's presidential ambitions. \"While he made his push as part of the Republican Party, I can say that we're happy to see him leave.\"\n\nWalker says the feeling is mutual, adding that running as a Republican in Delaware is practically hopeless.\n\n\"If you want to win a statewide election here, you have to be a Democrat,\" he said. \"They have more registered voters, they're much better organized and they have a deeper bench. The only way a Republican can win is if they are extraordinarily wealthy or talented as a communicator and a leader and I don't see anyone like that in Delaware.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party in Delaware does not seem any happier he is joining them.\n\n\"When Walker ran as Democrat in 2016, he earned less than 5 percent of the vote,\" said Erik Raser-Schramm, state Democratic Party chairman. \"Two years later, he brought his disgraceful brand of racism, misogyny and lunacy to the Republican Party and won their nomination to Congress.\"\n\nAlthough he previously backed President Donald Trump, Walker says he does not believe the incumbent is going to win re-election.\n\n\"He's overweight and out of shape,\" he said. \"I'm still a conservative but Democrats are going to need a conservative voice in order to win against a conservative like Donald Trump.\"\n\nIf his presidential run does not work out, Walker says he will consider a challenge to either Gov. John Carney or U.S. Sen. Chris Coons — contests in which he believes his blue dog Democrat views will help him.\n\n\"The fringe left in Delaware is confined to the higher circles of the party, especially women who enjoy being part of the radical chic,\" he said. \"For most of us life is a struggle and we don't have time for left-wing fantasies. We care about how we're going to pay our rent and how we're going to pay our tuition.\"\n\nWalker says he's leaning toward a bid for U.S. Senate if his presidential dreams don't pan out.

Another potential choice is Deval Patrick, a former Massachusetts governor and assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration.\n\n– Bart Jansen and David\n\nHouse to vote Wednesday on one-week extension to avoid government shutdown\n\nThe House will vote Wednesday on a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at its current levels for one week as Democrats and Republicans negotiate a compromise to avert a government shutdown.\n\nThe federal government is set to shut down Friday unless Congress acts, but the move by the House would extend that deadline by one week as lawmakers hurry to come to a deal before leaving for the holidays. The Senate would also need to pass the stop-gap measure before it goes to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\n\"I am disappointed that we have not yet reached agreement on government funding. The House will vote on Wednesday on a one-week CR to keep government open while negotiations continue,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said on Twitter, announcing the vote.\n\nSome of the biggest sticking points, according to a Democratic aide, revolve around immigration, as they have in years past – with funding for a wall along the southern border and immigrant detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement – at the center of the dispute. Another hurdle is possibly adding language on police reform after a summer of protests over the killings of Black people, including George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nAs lawmakers wrestle with a deal on government spending, they also hope to find a compromise on coronavirus relief with plans to add proposals into the must-pass spending bill. It is an ambitious feat with a short deadline after both sides of the aisle spent months at an impasse over needed help for Americans weathering the pandemic.\n\n– Christal Hayes and Nicholas Wu\n\nMichigan health official says Giuliani almost certainly contagious at hearing\n\nLANSING, Mich. – Ingham County Health Officer Linda Vail said it's \"extremely likely\" Rudy Giuliani was contagious when he testified before the state House Oversight Committee last week.\n\nThose who attended the Wednesday hearing without a mask or were within 6 feet of Giuliani must quarantine until Dec. 17, according to a Monday press release from the department. She suggested anyone who attended also quarantine.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mayor Giuliani has been hospitalized with COVID-19. His hospitalization comes only days after being in a confined conference room in Lansing for several hours without a mask,\" Vail said in a press release. \"Adding to my concern is that many attendees were also unmasked. This is the highest level of risk. Those who were present without a mask and those who were within 6 feet of Mayor Giuliani must quarantine for the safety of others. I wish Mayor Giuliani a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nGiuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, testified last week in an unconventional committee meeting in which he repeated misinformation about the November election results. He did not wear a mask, nor did many of the witnesses who appeared next to him.\n\n– Carol Thompson, Lansing State Journal\n\nTop Trump aide Navarro cited for Hatch Act violation\n\nPeter Navarro, a top trade aide to President Donald Trump, violated a law intended to keep federal employees from engaging in political activity, the latest senior member of the administration ensnared by the prohibition.\n\nNavarro violated the law in a series of interviews and social media posts, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said Monday. More than a dozen similar reports have been leveled against Trump administration officials with little consequence.\n\nNavarro, an assistant to the president and the director of the Office for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, repeatedly attacked President-elect Joe Biden in media interviews and on social media in the months before the election, the office said. In one instance cited by the office, Navarro used his Twitter account to argue that “nice guys don't vote for NAFTA and China's entry into the WTO and destroy American factories and jobs like Joe did.”\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that investigates Hatch Act violations and other matters, referred the report to the president for “appropriate disciplinary action.” The White House has declined to act on the reports in the past and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Politico over the summer that “nobody outside of the Beltway really cares” about the violations.\n\nThe same office found in October that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue had violated the law in advocating for Trump’s reelection during a visit over the summer to North Carolina. Kellyanne Conway, a former senior aide to Trump, was also cited by the office for violating the act. Conway left the White House in August.\n\nThe 1939 Hatch Act is restricts federal workers from engaging in specific political activity in an effort to prevent members of the executive branch from interfering in elections. Prohibited activities include running for office, hosting fundraisers, making campaign speeches or distributing campaign materials.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus pushes Biden transition team on diversity in Cabinet\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has rolled out his next slate of Cabinet appointments, but mostly absent from the list so far are any Asian Americans. During a call with Biden’s transition team on Monday, lawmakers in the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus told top Biden transition aides Jeff Zients, Ted Kaufman and Steve Richetti that the Asian American community was “hurt” about the Asian American community’s turnout for Biden and potential lack of an Asian American in the Cabinet, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nBiden announced Monday morning he would appoint former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to the same position in his administration, but the caucus had wanted Murthy appointed to a higher-level role and had asked for his inclusion in the Cabinet. Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., said Monday in a statement the surgeon general should be elevated to a Cabinet-level position to “send a message that public health and true representation are sincere priorities.”\n\nHowever, during Monday’s call, the transition team told the caucus the elevation of surgeon general to a Cabinet-level position was unlikely, which Chu said was disappointing.\n\nSenior campaign adviser and incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain had been scheduled to attend the call but did not due to a conflict, which the source described as causing “more disappointment.” The caucus is concerned that Asian Americans do not have a connection to the White House, given the lack of representation at the top of the campaign, transition and inauguration teams.\n\nChu told USA TODAY in a brief phone interview later Monday the caucus was \"disappointed\" by what the Biden team had told them about the surgeon general position.\n\n\"When considering the fact that we have the worst pandemic in recent history that has affected so many parts of American life in such a terrible manner, we need to have a person on that Cabinet who is a voice for public health, and who is a physician,\" she said.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nDonald Trump says Rudy Giuliani is ‘doing well’\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday his attorney Rudy Giuliani is winning his battle with COVID-19.\n\n“Rudy’s doing well,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “No temperature.”\n\nThe former New York City mayor is in the hospital after testing positive for the virus, aided said Sunday.\n\nTrump said he spoke by phone with Giuliani earlier Monday.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAfter second recount, Georgia\n\nrecertifies Joe Biden’s victory in state\n\nGeorgia officials on Monday recertified President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory in Georgia after a second recount reaffirmed – again – the Democrat won the state and its 16 electoral votes.\n\nThe latest recount found Biden defeated President Donald Trump in Georgia by 11,769 votes, a narrower margin than the 12,284-vote advantage Biden had going into the second recount.\n\n“We have now counted legally cast ballots three times and the results remain unchanged,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference.\n\nRaffensperger also said “disinformation regarding election administration should be condemned and rejected.”\n\n\"I know there are people who are convinced that the election was fraught with problems, but the evidence – the actual evidence, the facts – tell us a different story.\"\n\nGov. Brian Kemp, who is required to sign off on the certification by state law, resisted calls from Trump and his allies to call a special legislative session to overturn the election and submit a new slate of Trump electors for the Electoral College.\n\nKemp and Raffensperger, who are both Republicans, have faced intense scrutiny from Trump as the president, who has refused to concede his election loss, has leveled baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nBiden’s win in Georgia is a major accomplishment for Democrats, who hadn’t had a presidential candidate carry Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nThe secretary of state’s office ordered an initial hand recount prior to the first certification of Biden’s victory that trimmed Biden’s lead from more than 14,000 votes to 12,284 after uncounted ballots were found in four counties.\n\nThe second recount, which was conducted by rescanning all paper ballots, was requested by the Trump campaign, which had the right to ask the recount because the margin of Biden's victory was within .5%. Raffensperger last week said the second recount would show “no substantial changes.”\n\nIn a ruling from the bench, a federal judge Monday dismissed a lawsuit from former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, an ally of the president, that sought to decertify Georgia’s election results and have voting machines reexamined.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n'The people have spoken': Judge rejects Sidney Powell's Michigan election lawsuit\n\nA Michigan federal judge has ruled against a sweeping legal bid to overturn election results in the state, determining the lawsuit brought by an ally of President Donald Trump was riddled with \"theories, conjecture and speculation\" but little evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nU.S. District Judge Linda V. Parker ruled against a request from Sidney Powell – an attorney disavowed by the Trump campaign who still champions its causes – to force the state to award its electoral votes to Trump despite President-elect Joe Biden winning Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes.\n\n\"In fact, this lawsuit seems to be less about achieving the relief Plaintiffs seek – as much of that relief is beyond the power of this Court – and more about the impact of their allegations on People’s faith in the democratic process and their trust in our government,\" reads a portion of the 36-page opinion.\n\n\"Plaintiffs ask this Court to ignore the orderly statutory scheme established to challenge elections and to ignore the will of millions of voters. This the Court cannot, and will not, do. The people have spoken.\"\n\nThis is the latest in a series of legal flops from the Trump campaign or supporters. Judges throughout Michigan and the U.S have rejected their claims, noting there is no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\n– Dave Boucher, Detroit Free Press\n\nArizona Legislature closes after Giuliani possibly exposed lawmakers to COVID-19\n\nPHOENIX – The Arizona Legislature will close for a week \"out of an abundance of caution\" after Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, possibly exposed several Republican lawmakers to COVID-19.\n\nThe president announced Giuliani had tested positive for the virus Sunday afternoon, less than a week after the former New York City mayor visited Arizona as part of a multistate tour aimed at contesting 2020 election results. The 76-year-old was later admitted to Georgetown University Medical Center.\n\nGiuliani had spent more than 10 hours discussing election concerns with Arizona Republicans — including two members of Congress and at least 13 current and future state lawmakers — at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix last Monday. He led the meeting maskless, flouting social distancing guidelines and posing for photos.\n\nGiuliani also met privately with Republican lawmakers and legislative leadership the next day, according to lawmakers' social media posts.\n\n– Maria Polletta, Arizona Republic\n\nBiden and Harris announce inaugural committee\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris announced the chair and co-chairs for their inaugural committee to help plan the Jan. 20 event.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. will serve as the committee's chairman; Reps. Cedric Richmond, D-La., and Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., will join Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti as co-chairs, the committee said in a statement.\n\n\"Kamala and I are honored and grateful to these leaders for joining our inaugural committee as co-chairs and helping to organize a safe inauguration for all Americans,\" Biden said. \"These leaders reflect the strength, spirit, and diversity of America and have always held a steadfast commitment to restoring the soul of the nation, building back the middle class, and unifying the country.\"\n\nAll were strong proponents of Biden during the campaign. Clyburn is widely credited with breathing life into what was a floundering primary campaign for the former vice president. Richmond has been named to serve as a senior White House adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement in the incoming administration. Blunt Rochester, a longtime friend of the Biden family, served on the committee that helped choose Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to be the then-nominee's running mate.\n\nThe inaugural committee works in coordination with Congress’ planning group on the arrangements for the Capitol ceremony, and organizes inaugural balls and other events surrounding the swearing-in. The format of those events is up in the air amid the global coronavirus pandemic, which has surged across the country.\n\nLast week, Biden named Delaware State University president Tony Allen to serve as CEO of the inaugural committee and campaign chief operating officer Maju Varghese as the group’s executive director.\n\nBecause of concerns about the spread of COVID-19, Biden's inauguration is expected to be a scaled-down affair. Biden said Friday he expects it will primarily be a virtual event with a \"more imaginative\" format than in previous years.\n\n\"It is highly unlikely that there will be a million people on the mall,\" Biden said. \"My guess is that there will not be a gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n\n– William Cummings\n\n'Organized chaos':Inauguration Day move into the White House for Bidens complicated by COVID\n\nBiden announces nominations for health team\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden unveiled his team of top health officials Monday morning, a key announcement for an administration that will immediately have to wrestle with the COVID-19 pandemic that is infecting an average of more than 200,000 Americans every day.\n\nBiden's announcement confirmed Sunday's reports that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is his pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Becerra would be tasked with leading Biden's fight to contain the virus, including the massive logistical operation that will be required to quickly distribute the coming vaccines to the U.S. population.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Becerra, 62, would be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services, a $1-trillion-plus agency with 80,000 employees and a portfolio that includes drugs and vaccines, leading-edge medical research and health insurance programs covering more than 130 million Americans.\n\nAnthony Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, will act as Biden's chief medical adviser.\n\nBiden's pick to replace Robert Redfield as the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is Rochelle Walensky, the head infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor.\n\nBiden also tapped former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to return to the role he held for the last three years of the Obama administration.\n\nJeff Zients, who served as director of the National Economic Council during the Obama administration will act as White House counselor and COVID-19 response coordinator. Former White House adviser Natalie Quillian will serve as deputy coordinator.

Trump shared the news by tweet, writing \"Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\"\n\nGiuliani was taken to Georgetown University Medical Center on Sunday where his son Andrew Giuliani said he is \"resting, getting great care and feeling well.\"\n\nSince the presidential election, Giuliani, 76, has traveled the country challenging the election results and integrity of the electoral system itself. During much of his travels, Giuliani was seen not wearing a mask and flouting social distancing guidelines.\n\nAlong with a cadre of lawyers affiliated with the Trump campaign, Giuliani has held regular news conferences claiming, without evidence, various conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of mass voter fraud.\n\nThe former New York City mayor has had an eventful year. Prior to the election, Giuliani was central to a story alleging criminal intent on the part of President-elect Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. Giuliani was also briefly featured in the sequel to the movie \"Borat\" in a sordid scene he later called \"a hit job.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nContributing: Meredith Newman, Delaware News Journal; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/18/dnc-live-coverage-democratic-convention-bill-clinton-speech/3394322001/", "title": "Joe Biden nomination: Live coverage of DNC, Jill Biden speech", "text": "WASHINGTON – Democrats formally nominated Joe Biden for president during the second night of a virtual convention Tuesday that started with scathing criticism of President Donald Trump’s administration and ended with personal reflections on the former vice president’s decades of service.\n\nMore than three decades after he first ran for president, Biden clinched the nomination following a virtual “roll call” featuring party luminaries from all 50 states and lesser-known Democrats who described Biden as ready to lead the nation through the twin crises of a pandemic and economic uncertainty.\n\n“We have shown that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage,” said Dr. Jill Biden, who delivered the evening’s marquee address. “We just need leadership worthy of our nation – worthy of you.”\n\nThe second night of the convention began with several high-profile Democrats slamming President Donald Trump. Former President Bill Clinton recited statistics about the number of infections and deaths from the pandemic, which he and others asserted could have been lowered if the Trump administration had acted differently or more quickly\n\nIt’s was a preview of a tough message Biden and other Democrats are certain to reprise between now and the Nov. 3 election.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“Did it have to be this way? No,” Clinton argued.\n\n“America, Donald Trump has quit on you,” claimed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n“We deserve a person with integrity and judgement,” former President Jimmy Carter said in a video.\n\nDespite the heavy line of attacks, the final minutes of the second night became far lighter as the party conveyed Biden as a man who had endured tremendous hardship in his own life and brokered friendships with those – like the late Sen. John McCain – on the other side of the aisle.\n\nMinutes after he clinched the nomination, Biden appeared briefly in a video with his grandchildren and family, promising to say more later. The former vice president reappeared to embrace his wife after her remarks, which became personal and emotional as she recalled how Biden handled the death of their son, Beau Biden, who died in 2015.\n\n“I wondered if I would ever smile or feel joy again,” Jill Biden said.\n\nBut, she said, four days after Beau’s funeral, she watched her husband put on a suit, take a deep breath and “walk out into a world empty of our son.”\n\n“He went back to work. That’s just who he is,” she said. “He and Kamala (Harris) will work as hard as you do every day to make this nation better.”\n\nBiden is set to formally accept the nomination Thursday.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nJill Biden ends Day 2 by saying her husband will make the nation whole\n\nJill Biden spoke as a teacher, a mother and a wife when she addressed the Democratic National Convention on the night her husband was formally nominated to challenge President Donald Trump.\n\nThe former Second Lady described her husband as a man who has gone through the unimaginable while still managing to keep putting one front in front of the other.\n\n“He does it for you,” she said of Joe Biden. “His faith is in you, in us.”\n\nAnd she shared her own pain from the 2015 death of Beau Biden, the family’s oldest child, drawing larger lessons to be applied to a broken nation.\n\n“How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole,” she said. “With love and understanding – and with small acts of kindness. With bravery. With unwavering faith.”\n\nBiden spoke from Room 232 of the high school in Wilmington, Delaware, where she taught English when her husband served in the Senate.\n\nA sign on the bulletin board read: “Welcome back Dr. Jill Biden.”\n\nWhile she didn't mention Trump in her 10-minute speech, Biden used the backdrop of the school to address the pandemic, saying she’s heartbroken by the magnitude of the nation’s loss of life and the “failure to protect our communities.” She said she feels the frustration of parents juggling work while supporting their children’s learning or fearful they’ll get sick at school.\n\n\"Like so many of you,\" she said, \"I’m left asking: how do I keep my family safe?\"\n\nAs she’s done at past conventions, Biden on Tuesday told the story of Joe Biden losing his first wife and baby daughter in a 1972 car crash. His two sons, Beau and Hunter, were badly injured.\n\n“I feel in love with a man and two little boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss,” Biden said. “We found that love holds a family together.”\n\nAfter Jill and Joe married in 1977, they had a daughter, Ashley.\n\nBeau Biden, who introduced his father at the 2008 and 2012 conventions, died of brain cancer in 2015 at 46.\n\n“I wondered if I would ever smile or feel joy again,” Jill Biden said Tuesday.\n\nBut, four days after Beau’s funeral, she watched her husband put on a suit, take a deep breath and “walk out into a world empty of our son.”\n\n“He went back to work. That’s just who he is,” she said. “I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nColin Powell speaks up for Biden\n\nFormer GOP Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke in support of Joe Biden, saying he would bring the country together and not coddle dictators.\n\n“Today, we are a country divided, and we have a president doing everything in his power to make it that way and keep us that way,” Powell said without mentioning Trump by name. “What a difference it will make to have a president who unites us, who restores our strength and our soul.”\n\nPowell’s decision to address the virtual convention on behalf of Biden makes him one of the most prominent Republicans to play a part in the process of nominating the former vice president.\n\nPowell, who served in President George W. Bush’s cabinet, said in 2016 he would vote for Hillary Clinton, partly because of Trump’s leading role in the “birther” movement questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama’s citizenship.\n\nThen in June, Powell, the first African-American secretary of state, said he planned to vote for Biden while chiding Trump for his behavior, notably the decision a few days before to clear Lafayette Square in Washington D.C. of mostly peaceful protestors so he could stage a photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church with a bible.\n\nOn Tuesday, Powell said Biden will be a president “we will all be proud to salute.”\n\n“With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries—never the other way around,” he said. “He will trust our diplomats and our intelligence community, not the flattery of dictators and despots. He will make it his job to know when anyone dares to threaten us. He will stand up to our adversaries with strength and experience. They will know he means business.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nAdy Barkan: Put Biden in office, then fight for progressive causes\n\nAfter video segments highlighting Biden’s health care plan, progressive activist Ady Barkan delivered a speech on the importance of access to health care for all Americans, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Barkan was diagnosed with the degenerative neurological disease ALS in 2016 shortly after the birth of his son and has become a prominent voice for single-payer health care.\n\nBiden has said he wants a Medicare-like option and to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“We live in the richest country in history and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right. Everyone living in America should get the health care they need regardless of their employment status or ability to pay,” Barkan said.\n\nBarkan made headlines in 2017 when he was filmed confronting former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake over a tax bill. Barkan initially supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president and then backed Sen. Bernie Sanders. Barkan and Biden disagree on Medicare for All, but Barkan has urged progressives not to sit out of the November election.\n\nIn July, Barkan announced his endorsement of Biden. The two discussed their differences in a video interview, and Barkan said he would take Biden up on an offer to help “figure out what’s enough” on health care should Biden be elected.\n\n“Although he & I have different perspectives on the world, winning this election is essential,” Barkan said at the time.\n\nBarkan said Tuesday that with Biden as president, progressives can continue advocating for further action on health care.\n\n“We must elect Joe Biden. Each of us must be a hero for our communities, for our country, and then, with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve,” Barkan said.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nJohn Kerry: Trump heading overseas is a ‘blooper reel’\n\nJohn Kerry, the former secretary of state and 2004 Democratic nominee for president, slammed President Donald Trump for failing to confront Russia over interfering with the 2016 election or over bounties allegedly put on U.S. troops.\n\n“When this president goes overseas, it isn’t a goodwill mission, it’s a blooper reel,” Kerry said. “Our troops can’t get out of harm’s way by hiding in the White House bunker.”\n\nRepublicans blasted Kerry for negotiating a deal aimed at hindering Iran’s nuclear program during the Obama administration and Trump withdrew from the deal. Trump has focused his foreign policy on securing the borders and renegotiating trade deals with Canada and Mexico, and with China.\n\nKerry served in the Senate from Massachusetts with the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge Trump, Joe Biden of Delaware. Kerry said Biden, a former chairman of the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees, for having the steely grit to deal with international crises such as genocide in the Balkans or apartheid in South Africa. Kerry also promoted the Obama administration’s support of the Paris climate change agreement with 195 nations and stopped ebola before it became a pandemic.\n\n“Joe’s moral compass has always pointed in the right direction,” Kerry said. “Joe understands that none of the issues of this world – not nuclear weapons, not the challenge of building back better after COVID, not terrorism and certainly not the climate crisis – none can be resolved without bringing nations together.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden formally seizes Democratic nomination\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday formally secured enough Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee to challenge President Donald Trump, winning one of the highest prizes in U.S. politics more than three decades after he first campaigned for it.\n\nThough presidential nominating conventions haven’t been contested for decades and Biden demonstrated he had enough support for the nomination months ago, the formal roll call is nevertheless a symbolic milestone and an expression of the party’s support for their candidate.\n\nDuring the state primaries and caucuses, Biden collected 2,687 delegates -- more than twice the 1,073 earned by his closest rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden will formally accept the nomination Thursday.\n\nThe nomination completes the chief – and least suspenseful - objective of the convention: Choosing the candidate that will be on the November presidential ballot. But it’s also done with fanfare and celebration, a moment where party rivals who vied for the nomination united behind the nominee.\n\nAn unconventional roll call to nominate Joe Biden\n\nFew moments have underscored the unusual nature of the Democrats' virtual convention as the roll call Tuesday that is expected to lead to Joe Biden's nomination.\n\nAll 57 states and territories are participating in the “Roll Call Across America,” which included video montages from each area when their turn came to announce their delegate allocations. The various party activists announcing those delegate pledges weren't just governors, senators and congressmen but also parents, teachers, and small business owners.\n\nThat meant local delegates could make their announcements with symbols of the state’s beauty or important landmarks, such as a fire station in Connecticut, the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama or the Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarisol Garcia, a high school parent and a union organizer for the National Education Association, announced Arizona’s votes with cacti in the background.\n\n“Arizona casts 29 votes for Bernie Sanders and 51 for our next president Joe Biden,” she said with cacti in the background.\n\nThe display marked a major departure from past years and underscored the challenges convention planners have endured because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn normal election years, delegates gather on the floor of the hall and formally announce -- state by state -- how their delegation will vote. Though the results are almost always preordained, the roll call gives a member of a state's party a chance to offer a short speech espousing the soon-to-be-nominee and promote their areas while building a sense of drama until the candidate formally crosses the threshold of delegates needed to seize the nomination.\n\n— John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nElevator operator touts Biden\n\nNational conventions usually feature politicians and party stars – but not always.\n\n“I could tell he really saw me,” Jacquelyn Brittany, a security guard at the New York Times who operated the elevator during a Biden visit there last year, said during the convention.\n\n“Nominating someone like that to be in the White House is a good place to start,” she said.\n\nJacquelyn has declined to publicize her last name. Brittany is her middle name, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBrittany was one of several people who seconded Biden’s nomination before the formal roll call of delegates.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nAOC gives nominating speech for Bernie Sanders\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most outspoken progressives in Congress, delivered a nomination speech for Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of the official roll call that will nominate Joe Biden as the party’s candidate.\n\nSanders, Biden’s last standing opponent in the primary race, suspended his run for the Democratic nomination in April and has supported Biden. Ocasio-Cortez’s roughly 90-second speech didn’t mention Biden but established the ideals of the progressive wing of the party.\n\nThe progressive movement is “striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia,” Ocasio-Cortez said, adding that it “realizes the unsustainable brutality of an economy that rewards explosive inequalities of wealth for the few at the expense of long term stability for the many.”\n\nWhen the length of her speech was first reported at one minute, some viewed it as a snub to progressives, noting that some Republicans were given more time to speak. Others saw her inclusion as a sign Democrats are hoping to unify progressives and centrists against Trump.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was a prominent backer and surrogate for Sanders’ campaign and has since said she will vote for Biden but hopes to influence his platform to the left. She co-chaired the climate task force to advise Biden on policy.\n\nSanders, who spoke on the first night of the Democratic Convention, has asked his supporters to back Biden despite their differences in ideology. He said during his speech Monday that the country cannot withstand another Trump term.\n\n“The future of our democracy is at stake,” Sanders said. “The price of failure is just too great to imagine.”\n\nBob King, former president of the United Auto Workers, also delivered a symbolic nominating speech for Sanders on Tuesday.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\n‘The buck never stops.’ Clinton hits Trump on COVID-19\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton sought to recapture some of his “explainer in chief” mojo during remarks Tuesday that were highly critical of President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Did it have to be this way? No,” Clinton said of coronavirus infection rates and deaths, after relating several of those statistics. “COVID hit us much harder than it had to.”\n\nClinton blamed Trump for ignoring the advice of scientists and spending too much time on social media blaming others for the crisis: “The buck never stops there,” he said.\n\nThe 42nd president has ridden peaks of popularity between troughs of disfavor since leaving the White House in 2001. His 48-minute speech at the 2012 convention was viewed by some Democrats as a more cogent argument for President Barack Obama’s second term than anything Obama had offered himself at that point in the campaign, and it earned Clinton the nickname “explainer in chief.”\n\nBut while Clinton has remained popular among the Democratic establishment, the controversies of his presidency and allegations of sexual assault and harassment have come into harsher light during a MeToo movement that has exposed similar, systemic problems in the workplace.\n\nAnd so while Clinton played an extensive role on stage at the 2016 convention when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the nominee, his speaking time was limited to just a few minutes Tuesday and his slot fell in the 9 p.m. hour before major networks began carrying the convention in its entirety.\n\nClinton has addressed every Democratic convention since 1980.\n\nWith no direct stake in this year’s election, Clinton, who turns 74 on Wednesday, has remained out of the fray of the race. But the distance also gives him an opportunity to deliver more of a direct attack on Trump without running the risk of firing up Trump’s core Republican supporters.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nSchumer: Trump has quit on America\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose middle name Ellis stems from the iconic New York immigration facility Ellis Island, stood Tuesday in front of the Statue of Liberty as a beacon of hope for the world.\n\n“America, Donald Trump has quit on you,” Schumer said. “We need a president with dignity, integrity the experience to lead us out of this crisis.”\n\nHis daughter’s middle name is Emma after Emma Lazarus, whose poem graces the statue.\n\n“Beckoned by the lady behind us, we will reform our immigration system so that immigrants yearning to breathe free will at last become American citizens,” Schumer said.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday that Democrats must elect presumptive nominee Joe Biden president and regain control of the Senate in order to pursue affordable healthcare, protect voting rights and take decisive action against climate change.\n\n“Democrats must take back the Senate,” Schumer said. “Out of this long national nightmare, America will finally awaken to a brighter future and a new day.”\n\nDemocrats controlled half of Congress under Trump by leading the House of Representatives. But Schumer of New York could begin leading the Senate – setting the agenda for floor debate on legislation and nominations to courts and federal agencies – if Biden wins and his coattails are long enough to flip three seats from Republican to Democratic.\n\nIn campaign speeches, Trump promotes the confirmation of nearly 300 federal judges, including two members of the Supreme Court, during his first term. He warns that if he loses, Democrats would pursue gun control that he would not.\n\nSchumer said a variety of Democrats oppose Trump, Biden’s former primary rivals in the Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Schumer said the opposition ranges to more moderate Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia.\n\n“We will stay united, from Sanders and Warren to Manchin and Warner – and together, we will bring bold and dramatic change to our country,” Schumer said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nJimmy Carter: Biden is the right person for this moment in our nation’s history\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter said Joe Biden had the “experience, character and decency to bring us together and restore America’s greatness” in his first appearance at a presidential nominating convention in eight years.\n\n\"We deserve a person with integrity and judgement, someone who is honest and fair, someone who is committed to what is best for the American people,\" the 95-year-old said in prerecorded remarks. “Joe is that kind of leader, and he is the right person for this moment in our nation’s history.\"\n\nCarter appeared with his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who marked her 93rd birthday on Tuesday. She spoke about working with both Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden on tackling the demands faced by more than 53 million unpaid caregivers who are juggling work and family responsibilities.\n\n\"Joe knows well, too well, the sorrows and struggles of being a family caregiver, from Joe’s time as a young widower thrust into single parenthood with a demanding job to he and Jill caring for their own parents and their son Beau at the end of their lives,\" she said. \"He knows caregiving is hard even on the good days.\"\n\nCarter, the 39th president, declined to attend the 2016 convention in Philadelphia, revealing after the election that he backed Sen. Bernie Sanders. His last appearance at a nominating convention was in 2012 when he delivered prime time remarks that were broadcast on the convention’s second night. The one-term Democratic president has mostly stayed out of domestic politics and focused much of his post-presidency on humanitarian work, which landed him a Nobel Peace Prize since he left office in 1981.\n\nCarter has been sheltering at his home in Plains, Georgia, amid the ongoing pandemic, and was notably absent from Congressman John Lewis’ funeral in Atlanta last month. The Georgia Democrat instead sent a letter of condolences that was read aloud at the funeral.\n\nThe former president recalled Biden as his \"first and most effective supporter in the Senate\" in his bid for the White House in 1976.\n\n\"For decades, he has been my loyal and dedicated friend,\" Carter said. \"He understands that honesty and dignity are essential traits that determine not only our vision but our actions. More than ever, that's what we need.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nYates slams Trump for treating U.S. ‘like his family business’\n\nFormer Acting Attorney General Sally Yates accused President Donald Trump of trampling on constitutional norms in one of the first addresses of the second night of the Democratic convention on Tuesday.\n\n“From the moment President Trump took office, he’s used his position to benefit himself rather than our country,” Yates asserted. “Put simply, he treats our country like it’s his family business.”\n\nYates, who gained prominence among Democrats after defying Trump at the Justice Department, was considered a potential running mate for Biden and some have speculated she remains in the running to serve as Attorney General should he win.\n\nYates served as deputy attorney general under former President Barack Obama and became acting attorney general in the chaotic early days of the Trump administration. Her profile was elevated dramatically when she instructed the department’s attorneys not to defend the administration’s hastily crafted travel ban on majority-Muslim nations, calling it unlawful.\n\nOn Tuesday, Yates added the word “shameless” to describe the ban.\n\nTrump immediately fired Yates.\n\nHer defiance was the first high profile case of a Justice Department staff member -- including some career officials and other political appointments made by Trump – questioning the president’s authority to carry out his early agenda. Trump loyalists have used the episodes to dismiss any pushback with the administration as evidence of a “deep state” conspiracy.\n\nYates later testified that she warned the White House early in Trump’s administration that their incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had misled senior officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his communications with the ambassador but later reversed course, arguing investigators entrapped him.\n\nTrump has argued that Flynn was “treated him very unfairly” and hasn’t ruled out a pardon for his former adviser.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nConvention gets started by featuring diverse voices attacking Trump\n\nStacey Abrams had hoped for a larger role at the Democratic National Convention, namely a spot on the presidential ticket that Joe Biden gave to California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nBut the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate still got a prime-time slot Tuesday, one of 17 “rising stars” the party tapped to give a keynote address leading up to the roll call vote that will officially elevate Biden as the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nThe choice is clear between Biden and Trump is clear, she said: “A leader who cares about our families or a president who only cares about himself.”\n\nAbrams, who was among those Biden was said to consider for his running mate at one point, narrowly lost the 2018 race for governor. She now chairs Fair Fight Action, an organization aimed at mobilizing Black voters and eliminating obstacles to voter access nationwide.\n\nThe virtual nature of the convention has also changed the format a bit. Instead of one up-and-rising Democrat to deliver the keynote speech, the party chose to showcase 17, all of whom heralded Biden’s positions to expand health care, fight climate change and grow the economy.\n\nThe other 16 keynote speakers kicking off the second day of the convention included federal and state officeholders from across the country including key battleground states such as Florida (State Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried), Michigan (State Rep. Mari Manoogian), and Pennsylvania (Congressmen Brendan Boyle and Conor Lamb, and State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta).\n\nAlso on the roster were: Tennessee State Sen. Raumesh Akbari, Texas Congressman Colin Allred, Nevada State Sen. Yvanna Cancela, Former Ohio State Rep. Kathleen Clyde, Long Beach, California, Mayor Robert Garcia, South Carolina State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, Texas State Rep. Victoria Neave, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, Georgia State Rep. Sam Park, Georgia, New Hampshire State Rep. Denny Ruprecht, and Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor Randall Woodfin.\n\n“There’s a lot riding on this election,” Nez said in a video message that includes separately recorded sound bites from his fellow keynoters.\n\n“When we’re facing the biggest economic and health crisis in generations because our president didn’t and still doesn’t have a plan,” Garcia added.\n\nMost Americans might not be familiar with those names but they well could be over the next decade as they climb the party ranks, said Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management (GSPM) at George Washington University.\n\n“If you are interested in creating essentially a national profile, you need to become known among the activists within your party,” she said. “Even if they don’t generate a tremendous amount of celebrity or name recognition, what it does do is put them on the radar screen of democratic party activists who will start supporting them in their current race, in the next race or on policy issues they’d like to advance … this is an opportunity for more than 15 minutes of fame.”\n\n-- Ledyard King\n\nTrump blasts Michelle Obama for taped speech, DNC’s ‘very bad’ ratings\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of Tuesday attacking former first lady Michelle Obama for delivering prerecorded remarks to the Democratic National Convention that included a searing rebuke of his administration.\n\n“Unlike Michelle Obama, I’m doing it live,” Trump said of his plans for his Republican nomination acceptance speech after a briefing on border wall construction in Yuma, Arizona. “Live, by the way, is always much more exciting than tape, especially once you made the tape long before the event.”\n\nTrump, who flew from Washington to Iowa to Arizona as part of a jam-packed schedule of counter-programming during the DNC, criticized the former first lady for citing an outdated COVID-19 death toll and failing to mention Sen. Kamala Harris as Biden’s historic pick as his running mate during taped remarks on the opening night of the convention.\n\nDuring her speech, Obama said “more than 150,000” Americans had died from the coronavirus, a number that has since topped 170,000.\n\nTrump dismissed her speech as “divisive” and “devoid of facts.”\n\n“She didn’t even have the accurate facts and then they say, ‘what a wonderful job.’ What was wonderful about it?” Trump asked.\n\nObama delivered a blistering attack on Trump, calling him “the wrong president for our country” who is “clearly in over his head.” While urging Americans to vote for Biden, Obama said Trump’s failure to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and his response to the Black Lives Matter protests underscored his inability to lead the country through crisis.\n\n“You simply cannot fake your way through this job,” she said.\n\nThe speech appeared to rankle Trump, who tweeted about it multiple times earlier on Tuesday. He later took aim at the Obama administration, slamming his predecessor for his handling of the swine flu outbreak and insisting he “would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama.”\n\nTrump also blasted the DNC for “very bad” ratings after it was revealed that the first night of the convention drew about 25% fewer views across six networks compared to 2016, according to preliminary data from Nielsen Media Research. The convention averaged about 19 million viewers across six networks during the 10 p.m. hour when most networks carried the event. The figures do not include viewers on other networks, streaming services, or social media platforms.\n\n“Well their ratings were very bad,” Trump told reporters. “I thought it was not the best television I’ve ever watched. It was brutal actually.”\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nGuard who met Biden in elevator to nominate him\n\nA security guard who gushed over meeting Joe Biden in an elevator during his visit with The New York Times editorial board will be the first person to put his name into nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nJacquelyn Brittany is one of three people putting Biden’s name into nomination on Tuesday night. She’ll be joined by Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, both from Delaware.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who has declined to share her last name publicly, was filmed telling the former vice president “I love you” as she escorted him to the newspaper’s editorial board meeting. While Biden lost the paper’s endorsement, his team elevated the clip of Brittany as evidence that Biden appeals to average working Americans rather than elites.\n\nBiden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield tweeted that Jacquelyn’s was “the most powerful endorsement of the 2020 cycle.”\n\n- Associated Press\n\nCindy McCain talks about John McCain's friendship with Joe Biden\n\nIn a pre-recorded video, Cindy McCain highlights the late Sen. John McCain's close friendship with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in another high-profile instance of a Republican lending her voice to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn the video, first reported on by the Associated Press, McCain narrates key moments of the Biden-McCain friendship, with photos and video clips of the two men. A snippet of the video on YouTube does not contain an explicit endorsement of Biden over Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the video, Cindy McCain talks about the two families that grew close, as her husband and Biden worked together and traveled thousands of miles together.\n\nIn the teaser on YouTube, McCain says the two men grew close when Biden, a senator from Delaware at the time, met John McCain when McCain was assigned as a Navy aide for him on an overseas trip.\n\n— Yvonne Sanchez, Arizona Republic\n\nTrump will accept nomination at the White House\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday he will formally accept his party's nomination in a speech delivered at the White House, ending weeks of speculation about what will be one of the most closely watched events of the presidential election.\n\nTrump, speaking in Yuma, Arizona, said he would deliver the remarks from the South Lawn.\n\n- John Fritze\n\nJill Biden will take from her time as a teacher\n\nJill Biden is expected to speak about being a teacher during the pandemic from the Delaware high school classroom where she taught while Joe Biden was a senator.\n\n“You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways,\" she said in prepared remarks. \"There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors. The rooms are dark and the bright young faces that should fill them are confined to boxes on a computer screen.”\n\nClinton expected to go after Trump\n\nClinton is expected to criticize Trump over the high unemployment rate at a time when he should be leading the world.\n\n\"At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center,\" Clinton said in prepared remarks. \"Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes—his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there.”\n\nA theme of leadership\n\nThe theme of the night is: \"Leadership Matters,\" John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee and former secretary of state, is among the speakers. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, a vocal critic of Trump, will also be speaking.\n\nKerry is expected to criticize Trump for pretending that Russia didn't try to influence the 2016 election and for failing to act against bounties that Russia allegedly put on U.S. troops.\n\n\"So he won’t defend our country,\" Kerry said in a prepared remarks. \"He doesn’t know how to defend our troops. The only person he’s interested in defending is himself.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/us/five-things-january-31-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Jan. 31: Ukraine, SCOTUS, Spotify, North Korea ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Ukraine\n\nThe two top senators on the Foreign Relations Committee say they are confident they will get a bipartisan deal on Russian sanctions when the Senate comes back from recess, despite some sticking points. Some sanctions on the table could happen upfront, while others would go into effect if Russia were to invade Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, is questioning the framing of NATO as a “defensive” alliance, complaining that the bloc’s “line of defense” continues to move east toward the county. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said yesterday this is a clear sign that Russia will “highly likely” invade Ukraine. The White House has also warned that a Russian invasion into Ukraine is “imminent.” President Joe Biden said Friday he will move US troops to NATO allies in Eastern Europe in the “near term,” marking a new phase in the US response to Russia’s escalation on the Ukrainian border.\n\n2. Supreme Court\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will move quickly with the confirmation process once President Joe Biden announces his pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, the panel’s chair said yesterday. The comments from Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin come days after Breyer, the senior liberal on the high court, announced he would be retiring at the end of the court’s term. The White House has begun its search for his potential replacement, assuring the pick will be a Black woman. Across the aisle, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham lavishly praised one of Biden’s possible contenders, South Carolina US District Judge J. Michelle Childs, as “qualified by every measure” and “one of the most decent people I’ve ever met.” Graham, who represents South Carolina, sits on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Democratic lawmaker's emotional reaction to Biden's SCOTUS pledge 01:31 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Spotify\n\nSpotify announced it is adding a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes discussion about Covid-19. This comes after the streaming service received a flurry of criticism from a number of prominent artists who said they will leave the platform if it continues to host comedian Joe Rogan, whose podcast has spread misleading and inaccurate claims about vaccines and the virus. Spotify’s new advisory will direct listeners to a Covid-19 hub that will include links to trusted sources. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are among a growing list of prominent people who have expressed their concerns to Spotify over Covid-19 misinformation – a move sparked by musician Neil Young. Earlier this month, a group of more than 250 scientists, doctors and nurses penned an open letter to Spotify condemning the streamer for hosting Rogan after he suggested that healthy young people should not necessarily get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Joe Rogan's podcast stirs big problems for Spotify 03:38 - Source: CNN\n\n4. North Korea\n\nNorth Korea fired its most powerful ballistic missile in years over the weekend, an escalation of its weapons program and a possible sign of larger tests to come. A senior US official says the launch – the latest in a string of provocations from North Korea – could be designed to extract concessions from the US ahead of potential negotiations. The Biden administration has long sought to restart diplomacy with Pyongyang, extending the invitation for talks without any preconditions. While there has been “no serious discussion internally” of a meeting between President Joe Biden and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, officials are eager for talks at a lower level “anytime, any place.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Working through list of missiles': Expert on North Korea testing 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Australian Open\n\nRafael Nadal fell to his knees yesterday after winning a record-breaking 21st grand slam men’s singles title in the Australian Open final. After rallying from two sets down, the No. 6 seed Nadal defeated World No. 2 Daniil Medvedev of Russia in an epic match that lasted more than five hours. This is Nadal’s second Australian Open crown (2009), and it follows an emotional series of events in the competition. Novak Djokovic, the world No. 1, was initially favored to take home the win, but he was denied entry into the country after having his visa revoked for being unvaccinated against Covid-19. On the women’s side, Ashleigh Barty beat Danielle Collins to become the first home Australian Open singles champion since 1978.

Awful, says Sen. Chris Coons\n\nThe Trumps' announcement came just hours after White House aide Hope Hicks, with whom the president had recently traveled, had also tested positive and displayed symptoms.\n\nFor now, Brady said she doesn't expect the president's positive test result to force his party to rethink its response to the pandemic.\n\n“Our party’s response has been responsible,\" she said. “The myth if you are Republican you’re not acting responsibly is ridiculous. If you look at who the first groups of people that were not acting responsibly were, it was all the liberal, left-wingers and extremists who were protesting in the streets and setting up in the middle of town.\"\n\nPROTEST OUTSIDE BIDEN'S HOME:National group holds demonstrations at Biden home, church\n\nBrady is referring to protests over the summer that erupted across the state and country in response to police brutality against people of color. Months before those protests, conservatives held their own protests in Delaware against Gov. John Carney's state of emergency restrictions that shut down businesses and closed beaches, and many did not wear masks or practice social distancing.\n\nBrady said that some Republicans have faced backlash for not wearing a mask, but other Republicans like herself have worn masks.\n\n\"I just don’t think that there’s a huge difference between how people in the GOP and people in the Democrat Party are handling precautions,\" she said, adding that the president has the \"enviable position\" of having people around him tested regularly and that it appears he contracted the virus from an aide instead of in public or at a rally.\n\nFURTHER READING:In wake of Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, Delaware politicians who attended debate get tested\n\n“The facts have been misrepresented and the response by many governments has been excessive, and the fact that the president contracted COVID does not mean that those facts are no longer true,\" Brady said. \"I think a lot will depend on whether he is able to participate in the next scheduled debate.”\n\nWhile Trump's White House chief of staff reported that he is showing mild symptoms as of Friday morning, the 74-year-old's age and weight put him in the high-risk category of people who are more susceptible to severe and sometimes deadly cases of the virus.\n\nBut Delaware U.S. Senate candidate Lauren Witzke, a Trump supporter, expressed confidence that the president, who has pledged to quarantine, would be fine.\n\n\"We expect President Trump will make a full recovery, and we’re looking forward to seeing him back on the campaign trail soon!\" she said in an emailed statement on Friday morning.\n\nIt's not likely that the news will sway Trump's base, either. One of his supporters, 54-year-old Bear resident Alan Knight, said that while he's surprised that the president contracted the virus, he's not worried.\n\n\"You stand more of chance dying in your car on your way to work,\" Knight said. \"The wide spread panic is just ridiculous.\"\n\nDELAWARE ELECTIONS:What the primary election winners and losers mean for the future of Delaware politics\n\nThe Delaware Democratic Party had a different take.\n\n\"First and foremost, we wish the President and First Lady well as they contend with this dangerous virus,\" said the Delaware Democratic Party's executive director, Jesse Chadderdon. \"But we also hope this is a point of introspection for an administration that for too long has failed to take this virus seriously and set an example for the American people by wearing masks.

Larry Hogan said Sunday it took nearly two hours for the Pentagon to provide authorization for his state to send its National Guard contingent into Washington to help protect the U.S. Capitol as it came under attack from a violent pro-Trump mob.\n\nHe said that he and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser had been in contact and she had requested assistance but they needed the Department of Defense to sign off because of the district’s unique status as a federal district.\n\n\"Our guard mobilized and was ready, but we couldn't actually cross over the border into D.C. without the OK, and that was quite some time. We kept running it up the flagpole – our generals talking to the National Guard generals,\" Hogan told CNN’s \"State of the Union\" program.\n\n\"I can't speak as to what was going on on the other end of the line back at the Pentagon or in the White House,” Hogan added. \"I was in the middle of a meeting when my chief of staff came in and said the Capitol was under attack. ... We were in contact with the mayor's office who requested assistance. We immediately sent police assistance. I immediately called up the National Guard.\"\n\nHogan said that eventually, his office got a call from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy asking them to send to deploy their National Guard.\n\n\"We had already been mobilizing.

He joined the force in 2008. Liebengood, 51, who also responded to the riots on Wednesday, died on Saturday. He joined the force in 2005.\n\nPrior to the proclamation, Trump and the White House faced criticism for not lowering the flag – a measure that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered take place at the Capitol on Friday.\n\n\"It’s hideous but we must acknowledge it: the WH flags are not at half staff in memory of Officer Sicknick because Trump doesn’t mourn him,\" CNN’s Jake Tapper wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also condemned the delay on ABC’s \"This Week.\"\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that the flag at the White House is not at half-staff for that Capitol Hill police officer, who gave his life in protecting one of our institutions of democracy,\" he said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and President-elect Joe Biden both expressed sympathy to Sicknick’s family on Friday.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nUS Capitol Police officer, 51, dies; cause not released\n\nA U.S. Capitol Police officer died while off duty on Saturday, according to a statement released by the law enforcement agency responsible for protecting federal property in Washington.\n\nHoward Liebengood, 51, had been with the department since 2005 and was assigned to the Senate Division, police said. The department's statement did not say the cause of Liebengood's death.\n\nAccording to the Capitol Police union, Liebengood was \"among the officers who responded to the rioting at the U.S. Capitol\" on Wednesday. At least one police officer was killed amid the riot; four other people also died. Dozens of other officers were injured in the attack.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and colleagues,\" the department said in its statement. \"We ask that his family, and other USCP officers’ and their families’ privacy be respected during this profoundly difficult time.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPhysician urges Congress members may have been exposed to COVID in Capitol riot\n\nDr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, urged all elected officials and their staff to observe public health measures and get tested for the coronavirus after potentially being exposed to someone infected with COVID-19 while the Capitol was locked down during an armed incursion by pro-Trump rioters.\n\nDuring the attack, \"many members of the House community were in protective isolation in room located in a large committee hearing space,” Monahan noted in an email.\n\n\"The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others. During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection,\" the physician wrote.\n\nAt least six Republican members of Congress refused to wear masks while in lockdown, even after Democratic colleagues pleaded with them. In one video, Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said \"I’m not trying to get political here,\" while declining a mask offered by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del.\n\n\"Please continue your usual daily coronavirus risk reduction measures (daily symptom inventory checklist, mask wear, and social distancing). Additionally, individuals should obtain an RT-PCR coronavirus test next week as a precaution,\" Monahan advised.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to aggressively spread across the United States. The nation has reported over 370,000 deaths and more than 22 million cases since the start of the pandemic.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPoll: Majority wants Trump removed from office before inauguration\n\nA majority of Americans now believe President Donald Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in.\n\nA new poll published Sunday by ABC News/Ipsos found that 56% of those surveyed want Trump to be removed before Inauguration Day. A higher figure – 67% – blame the commander-in-chief for the riots in Washington this week that left 5 people dead after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol building, overpowering police and ransacking the complex.\n\nThe chaotic incident followed Trump's \"Save America Rally\" in Washington, during which he told his supporters to \"stop the steal\" of the election he lost to Biden. Trump urged them to head to the Capitol to demonstrate against Congress certifying Biden's victory.\n\nHouse Democrats are preparing Monday to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump in connection with the riot. They accuse him of having \"gravely endangered the security\" of the U.S. and its institutions. It will be Trump’s second impeachment.\n\nThe ABC News/Ipsos poll found that most Democrats (94%) and a majority of independents (58%) believe Trump should be removed from office; only 13% of Republicans agree. In fact, 61% of Republicans believe Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSens. Manchin, Toomey call on Trump to resign\n\nSenators Joe Manchin, D-W.V., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., both condemned Wednesday’s armed attack on the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead and dozens injured and both senators said they believe President Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThe senators believed that Trump, who urged his supporters to \"never concede,\" \"walk down to the Capitol\" and \"show strength,\" encouraged the violence and should resign.\n\n\"The president’s behavior after the election was wildly different than his behavior before, he descended into a level of madness and engaged in a level of activity that was just absolutely unthinkable,\" Toomey told CNN’s \"State of the Union.\"\n\nToomey said Trump's incitement of the mob last week left the \"possibility that there's criminal liability here,\" though he conceded he was not sure whether there was enough evidence for a conviction.\n\n\"But there should be accountability,\" he said.\n\nManchin condemned fellow Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., saying \"I don’t know how they can live with themselves\" when \"people have died because of their words and actions.\" Both Cruz and Hawley led efforts to contest Congress’ official counting of the Electoral College vote, a longshot move to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nToomey expressed doubt on NBC News’ \"Meet the Press\" that impeachment would be a feasible punishment for Trump, noting it is not clear whether it can happen \"after a person has left office, which is what would have to happen here.\" However, the senator also hopes “that the president has disqualified himself'\" from winning another election by his words and actions.\n\nManchin said during the Capitol attack, when congresspeople and aides were under secure lockdown, he persuaded Senators Steve Daines, R-Mont., and James Lankford, R-Okla., to abandon Cruz and not contest the result. Manchin urged Cruz and Hawley to do the same, with no success.\n\n\"I most certainly believe there is blood on their conscience, that is for sure,\" Manchin said. \"Sooner or later, someone has got to say, 'This is not who we are.' Someone has got to speak truth to power.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nEx-WH chief of staff Mulvaney: Capitol riot worse than other Trump controversies\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" TV show Sunday that he doesn't currently know \"what's going on inside the Oval Office now\" and \"inside the president's head\" following riots this week in Washington, D.C.\n\nMulvaney announced his resignation Thursday as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday. Mulvaney was Trump's former acting chief of staff.\n\nMulvaney said Sunday that \"people took (Trump) literally\" when he encouraged his supporters to \"stop the steal\" and to go to the U.S. Capitol building to express their dissatisfaction with the outcome of November's presidential election, won by Joe Biden.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see that,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nHe said the ensuing riot was a \"fundamental threat to the United States\" and recounted an episode during Trump's impeachment hearing last year in which he told the president, who was accused of witness tampering: \"'Mr. President, this is a problem & we need to fix it.' He pushed back a little bit but then he ... he pivoted.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Fox News, Mulvaney appeared to defend the administration's handling of earlier controversies that engulfed Trump's White House, arguing the storming of the Capitol was of an entirely different magnitude.\n\n\"I think everybody recognizes that what happened on Wednesday is different,\" Mulvaney told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace. He said previous controversies \"were policy differences, many of them were stylistic. Wednesday was existential.\"\n\nMulvaney dodged a question on whether he supported the use of the 25th Amendment, used to get rid of an incapacitated or unfit president, to remove Trump from office.\n\n\"I think the 25th Amendment (is) a clumsy tool. We've never used it under these circumstances. We typically use it whenever a president goes through a medical procedure,\" he said.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nKellyanne Conway condemns armed riot at US Capitol\n\nFormer Senior White House Assistant Kellyanne Conway condemned the armed invasion of the US Capitol on Wednesday by pro-Trump rioters.\n\n\"Don't avert your eyes & don't excuse this,\" Conway said on Twitter of a report compiling haunting footage of the attacks. \"The more we see & learn, the worse it is.\"\n\n\"The events were outrageous and inexcusable. Democracy relies on dissent, not destruction. In this nation, differences of opinions are resolved by showing up at the ballot box, not by storming the barricade,\" Conway said in a statement Thursday.\n\nConway managed President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and was a senior White House adviser when Trump took office, sticking by the president through almost the entire tumult of his first term. Conway left the Trump administration in August 2020 after a public feud with her daughter in the media.\n\nThe former aide’s comments come as the Trump administration is roiling in its last days in office. Former and current aides have expressed worry about their involvement in the administration, while others have also condemned the Capitol attack or resigned from their posts.\n\nConway has continued to express support for the president, despite the Capitol attack.\n\n\"The thugs from yesterday are responsible for their own actions,\" Conway said. \"They don't represent the millions of Trump voters, or the massive 'MAGA' movement; they insult them.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPence to attend Biden's inauguration\n\nVice President Mike Pence will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, even as President Donald Trump intends to skip it.\n\nThe decision came a day after Trump announced he would decline to watch his successor sworn-in, breaking with more than 150 years of tradition. A source familiar with the decision speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed Pence's expected attendance.\n\nPence is facing considerable blowback from some Trump supporters – and significant praise from others – for defying the president’s demand that he somehow reject the results of the election as Congress met Wednesday to count Electoral College votes and formalized Biden’s win. Despite Trump’s protestations, Pence noted he had no power to reject the votes.\n\nBiden dismissed Trump’s decision not to attend the inauguration, telling reporters on Friday that it was \"one of the few things he and I ever agreed on.\" But of Pence, Biden said that he was \"welcome to come\" and that he’d “be honored to have him there.\"\n\n– John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}]}

Here's the forecast", "text": "The temperature in Providence could reach 90 degrees for the first time this summer on Thursday, an unusually late date for that milestone, and the city could also have its first heat wave as \"oppressive\" heat moves into the region, the National Weather Service says.\n\n\"Beginning Wednesday, heat and humidity begin to build, becomes oppressive [Thursday] and then peaks Friday,\" the weather service says in its online forecast discussion.\n\nThe temperatures in Providence are forecast to reach highs of 86 degrees Monday, 84 Tuesday, 89 Wednesday, 90 Thursday and 92 Friday, the weather service says. If Wednesday is a little hotter than expected and the temperature reaches 90 three days in a row, that will meet the definition of a heat wave.\n\nIt's been an \"unusually humid\" July, and that humidity will accompany the heat, making it feel even hotter, according to Bryce Williams, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Norton, Massachusetts. \"We're talking heat indexes in the upper 90s Thursday and Friday,\" Williams said.\n\nMore:Heavy rain Monday brings flooding in Rhode Island\n\nThe region has been stuck in a pattern this summer that has brought a lot of rain and humidity, possibly frustrating beach lovers, but it has also protected Southern New England from the excessive heat that's hit much of the rest of the country, Williams noted. July has been especially rainy, with 7.49 inches falling through the first 23 days of the month. That's well above the normal amount of 2.09 inches, according to the weather service.\n\nWhen will summer weather start in RI?\n\nThe timing of the rainfall may have left some wondering whether summer finally started last weekend, which finally brought two perfect weekend beach days. Rain had earlier spoiled potential trips to the beach over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, when more than an inch of rain fell. Then a record 3.35 inches of rain washed out beach plans on Sunday, July 16.\n\nRain showers and thunderstorms typically clear out the humidity, but that hasn't happened much this July, Williams noted. \"It has been an unusually humid July,\" he said.\n\nAs much of the country has weathered extreme heat, Providence is more than six weeks past the date when the temperature typically reaches 90 degrees for the first time of the year. The city usually hits that mark by June 6, according to the weather service, but the highest temperature this June was 82 degrees.\n\nAlthough summer starts on the first day of June, according to the meteorological definition, this June didn't offer a lot of beach days either, since it was 4.7 degrees cooler than normal, with an average temperature of 63.5 degrees.\n\nThe cool early summer weather apparently stopped some from going to the beach. Attendance at state beaches in May and June was down 27% from last year, dropping from 195,814 beachgoers in 2022 to 143,936 in this year, according to Michael Healey, chief public affairs officer for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Numbers for July aren't yet available.\n\n\"Few things are as dependent on the weather as beach traffic, and there’s no question that the generally sketchy weather we’ve had has affected beach traffic,\" Healey said via email.\n\n\"Now, July and August are our power months. We’re hopeful that we’ll get a nice, long stretch of sunny, hot, and humid days where Rhode Islanders are flocking to the beaches and we can reverse the stats from earlier in the summer,\" Healey said.\n\nSo far, July has been 1 degree warmer than normal, with an average temperature of 75.3 degrees, but the hottest days fell just shy of the 90-degree mark. The temperature has reached 89 degrees twice this month, on July 6 and 12, according to the weather service.\n\nProvidence typically has 10 days of temperatures 90 degrees or higher each summer. \"We're not anywhere close to that,\" Williams said. \"Hopefully, we won't get anywhere close to that. This will be our first foray into them.\"\n\nHow many heat waves did Providence have last summer?\n\nAlthough it's late July, there's still plenty of time left for hot weather. Last year, it took until July 13 to hit the 90-degree mark, but that month had seven more days of 90 degree temperatures or higher, including a six-day heat wave from July 19-24. That heat wave ended with the hottest day of the month, 98 degrees.\n\nAugust 2022 also had eight days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees and a six-day heat wave, from Aug. 4 through Aug. 9. The hottest day of the month was also 98 degrees, reached on Aug. 9, just before the heat wave broke.\n\nFor this week, the \"oppressive heat and humidity\" should break sometime Saturday or Saturday night, \"with the passage of a cold front followed by cooler and much-less-humid weather Sunday,\" the weather service says.\n\n\"This change in air mass may be preceded by scattered thunderstorms Thursday through Saturday, especially well inland,\" the weather service says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2022/07/22/heat-wave-causes-explained-safety-tips/10110508002/", "title": "What is a heat wave? Here's what causes them and how to stay safe.", "text": "Excessive heat can hit at any time during the year, even if temperatures over 100 degrees are the norm where you live. And sometimes, the weather can become unbearable. In bouts of extreme heat, your body might react in adverse ways, including experiencing dehydration or heat exhaustion.\n\nThroughout U.S. history, heat waves have struck coast-to-coast. The summer of 1936 is one of the hottest on record and impacted the country when air conditioning was not a staple in average homes, according to the National Weather Service. Around 5,000 Americans died from the extreme heat.\n\nBut what is the science behind a heat wave, and what causes it?\n\nWhat is a heat wave?\n\nA heat wave is a period of time when temperatures are well above average and much warmer than usual for that area and time of year, said Bianca Feldkircher, lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Phoenix.\n\nHeat waves can vary in length and intensity. But, in order to be classified as a heat wave, the high temperatures must last for at least two days, said Feldkircher.\n\nHeat waves can occur at any time of year and can take place anywhere in the world.\n\nStay safe in the sun:A guide to sunscreen expiration dates, and if waterproof really works.\n\nWhat causes a heat wave?\n\nHeat waves are typically caused by \"unusually strong, high pressure systems,\" said Feldkircher.\n\nAccording to the Farmer's Almanac, air from atmospheric upper levels is pulled downward and is then compressed, causing increases in temperature. The longer this high pressure system stays, the hotter the area becomes.\n\nWhen these high pressure systems linger over an area for a period of time, it is then classified as a heat wave, Feldkircher said.\n\nWhat happens to the human body during a heat wave?\n\nDuring extreme temperatures and heat waves, people may experience dehydration, heat exhaustion and in the most extreme cases, heat stroke, according to Boston University.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat stroke is considered the most serious heat-related illness. Symptoms of heat stroke include:\n\nConfusion, altered mental status, slurred speech\n\nLoss of consciousness\n\nHot, dry skin or profuse sweating\n\nSeizures\n\nVery high body temperature\n\nHeat stroke can even be fatal if not treated properly.\n\nHeat exhaustion is the result of excessive loss of water and salt, according to the CDC. Its symptoms include:\n\nHeadache\n\nNausea\n\nDizziness\n\nWeakness\n\nIrritability\n\nThirst\n\nSweating\n\nHigher body temperature\n\nDecreased urine output\n\nThose most at risk during heat waves include the elderly, children, those who are pregnant and those who are homeless, said Feldkircher.\n\nHow do you stay safe in heat wave?\n\nUnusually high temperatures should be taken extremely seriously, said Feldkircher. There are various ways to stay safe in a heat wave.\n\nIt is important to limit any kind of outdoor activity during the hottest parts of the day, said Feldkircher. If you can avoid going outdoors during those times, try to put off activities until the morning or after the sun goes down.\n\nStaying hydrated is also key to staying safe in heat waves. According to the Red Cross, on average, a person should drink approximately 3/4 of a gallon of liquids per day.\n\nEating foods that have a high water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can also keep you hydrated, said Feldkircher.\n\nThe Red Cross also advises to keep your home cool by doing the following:\n\nCovering windows with drapes or shades.\n\nInstalling air conditioners and insulation around them.\n\nUse window reflectors to send heat back outside.\n\nNational weather watches and warnings\n\nWhat is the heat index near you today?See map of real-feel temperatures across the US.\n\nJust Curious for more?

The agency is not identifying the woman, but did say she had underlying health conditions.\n\nThe distressing heat wave – which has exacerbated a flash drought in the southern and central Plains – has pushed state and local leaders to issue heat emergencies and offer resources to residents to mitigate the high temperatures.\n\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, on Thursday announced a heat emergency – triggered when the district sees a temperature of 95 degrees or higher – that will last until Monday morning.\n\n“Stay hydrated, limit sun exposure, and check on seniors, neighbors & pets,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter.\n\nPhiladelphia declared a heat health emergency for Thursday due to the expected oppressive heat, activating emergency programs likes special field teams that conduct home visits and outreach for people experiencing homelessness, the department of health said in a news release.\n\nSimilarly in New York, residents are encouraged to stay indoors in the upcoming days as the heat continues to sweep across the state to avoid “dangerous conditions that can lead to heat stress and illness,” according to Jackie Bray, the commissioner of the state’s homeland security and emergency services division.\n\nTemperatures over 90 degrees are expected to remain in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston through the weekend – if not longer.\n\nThe excessive heat across the US has been matched by deadly conditions in Europe, where records have been smashed and the European Forest Fire Information System put 19 European countries on “extreme danger” alerts for wildfires.\n\nA construction worker drinks water in temperatures that have reached well above triple digits in Palm Springs, California, on Wednesday.

Missouri similarly went from 2% to a third of the state experiencing severe drought.\n\nMeanwhile, triple-digit records were set Tuesday and Wednesday in multiple locations across Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma, where Tulsa EMS reported responding to nearly 250 heat-related emergency calls so far this year.\n\n“Those numbers are what we would expect to see in mid- to late-August,” Adam Paluka, spokesperson for the Emergency Medical Services Authority, said Wednesday. “So we’re four to six weeks ahead of where we would normally see those mid-200 call numbers.”\n\n“It’s very concerning,” he added, “especially because the amount of patients that are being transported indicates that some of those calls are heatstroke, which can be deadly.”\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, temperatures on Wednesday reached 110 degrees, breaking a 1936 record on that date. Another record of 104 degrees was set in San Antonio, Texas, surpassing the 101 degrees last experienced in 1996.\n\nAnd as of Tuesday, the Austin area reached at least 100 degrees on 38 out of the last 44 days, according to the weather service.\n\n“We’re asking people to conserve power so that the systems continue to operate,” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Wednesday. “We’re asking everybody to do that so that we can get through this together.”\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates about 90% of Texas’ power grid, said it set another record Wednesday for power demand – surpassing a record set a day prior.\n\nAlso, Wednesday, a record high of 103 degrees in Fayetteville, Arkansas, topped the 102 degrees seen on that date in 2012.\n\nAnother Arkansas city, Mountain Home, saw 107 degrees Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“This would shatter the old record high of 102 degrees for this date set back in 2012. Official record reports are not sent out until midnight but it sure looks like a new record high,” the weather service wrote Wednesday evening.\n\nSeveral US communities set or tied new daily records for high low temperatures this week, according to the National Weather Service. In Needles, California, the low temperature never got below 95 degrees Wednesday, tying a record set in 1901.\n\nIn Texas, the low temperature was 86 degrees Tuesday in Galveston, and Wichita Falls never got below 84 degrees on the same day.

Terms you should know\n\nRed flag?Large portion of Florida under red flag warning. What's that mean?\n\nHow to spot a rip current\n\nHere are some other water-related terms used by the National Weather service and what they mean.\n\nWhat is a small craft advisory?\n\nA small craft advisory is a type of wind warning issued by the National Weather Service when winds have reached, or are expected to reach within the next 12 hours, a speed around 25 to 38 miles per hour and/or seas or waves are greater than 4 feet.\n\nWhat is a gale warning and advisory?\n\nA gale warning is issued when sustained winds between 39 and 54 mph are predicted or occurring. The gale warning is issued when the winds are not directly associated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nAn advisory is issued for coastal waters when winds of 22mph to 38 mph to from are either predicted or occurring and/or seas are considered potentially hazardous to small boats. The seas range for various weather service offices. Key West uses 7 feet or greater. There is no legal definition for \"small craft.\"\n\nWhat is a storm warning?\n\nA storm warning is issued when sustained surface winds not directly associated with a tropical cyclone range from 55 mph to 73 mph.\n\nWhat is a storm watch?\n\nA storm is issued when there is an increased risk for sustained storm force winds or frequent gusts of 55 mph to 73 mph but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain.\n\nWhat is a special marine warning?\n\nA special marine warning affects coastal waters and is issued when there is a potential for hazardous weather conditions usually of short duration (2 hours or less) and producing wind speeds of 39 mph. It's issued when for conditions not adequately covered by existing marine warnings.\n\nA special marine warning also is issued when waterspouts are either predicted or occurring.\n\nWhat do forecasters mean when they refer to sustained winds?\n\nSustained winds are those wind speeds observed and averaged over at least 1 minute.\n\nWhat do they mean by swells?\n\nSwells are wind-generated waves. Swells usually are more regular and have more uniform crests and a longer period than wind waves.\n\nWhat is a waterspout?\n\nA waterspout is a rotating column of air that forms over water and whose circulation extends to the surface.\n\nWhat is a hazardous seas warning?\n\nA hazardous seas warning is issued when wave heights and/or wave steepness meet or exceed locally defined warning criteria.\n\nWhat is a hazardous seas watch?\n\nA hazardous seas watch is issued when there is an increased risk for a warning but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain.\n\nWhat is a high surf advisory and warning?\n\nA high surf advisory is issued when breaking waves pose a threat to life and property within the surf zone.

In addition, there will be little relief during overnight hours.\n\n“Even after the sun goes down, heat can be a real danger – especially in large cities. Dark pavement and buildings are very effective at absorbing heat,” the weather service office in Los Angeles said.\n\nAnd that’s why higher temperatures are more common in large cities, making them susceptible to becoming an “urban heat island,” the service explained.\n\nThe weather service defines a heat wave as a period of abnormally hot and humid weather lasting for more than two days.\n\nExcessive heat has killed more people than any other extreme weather event in the US.

Between 5 and 8 inches of rain fell over the region and there was two confirmed tornadoes (one in Hopkinsville, Ky., and one in Missouri). There was also widespread flooding in the ensuing weeks.\n\nNo. 3, April 3 tornadoes: On the anniversary of 1974's \"super outbreak\" of tornadoes, this region saw a smaller -- but still severe -- string of twisters.

March was the only month that was anywhere near what you would typically expect, with temperatures averaging slightly below normal. As we progressed into April, many of the days felt like we were still in March. In fact, it was one of the coldest April’s on record across the area, with some locations experiencing their coldest April on record. We even had measurable snow in April for the first time since 1983 for several communities. Then May 1st came, and temperatures suddenly warmed up quite abruptly. A flip in the weather pattern resulted in above normal temperatures occurring on every single day of the month of May.

According to the NWS, \"Two rounds of severe thunderstorms occurred on Thursday, June 28. The first round during the midday hours was relatively minor. The more significant outbreak occurred during the evening hours, when a thunderstorm complex raced southward across southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Widespread wind damage occurred with this complex, which met the definition of a derecho.\" If you were wondering, a derecho is defined as \"a line of intense, widespread, and fast-moving windstorms and sometimes thunderstorms that moves across a great distance and is characterized by damaging winds.\"\n\nNo. 7, Hot and humid! The NWS reminds us that the end of June and early July in 2018 were almost literally Hell. \"Upper level high pressure set up across the region to end the month of June and lasted through the 4th of July holiday week. This resulted in high temperatures routinely reaching into the low to mid-90s ... oppressive humidity levels were in place much of the time as well, with dewpoints up into the mid to upper 70s on a daily basis. We even had some dewpoint temperatures hit 80 degrees, which is considered extremely oppressive and uncomfortable. This resulted in daily heat index readings of 100 or above for seven straight days. The most intense heat and humidity occurred on July 5th when high temperatures reached into the mid to upper 90s and heat index readings soared to between 110 and 115 across much of the region.\"\n\nNo. 8, Thanks, Gordo: On Sept. 7-8 \"the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon merged with a cold front over the mid-section of the country,\" according to the NWS. \"The tropical moisture squeezed out by the front produced widespread heavy rainfall\" as well as some flash flooding and rotating storms.\n\nNo. 9, Fall goes AWOL: It was a very odd autumn. Some highlights included: \"September into the first 10 days of October were a continuation of summer, with many record highs being established. It was the warmest start to October on record with highs well into the 80s and lower 90s. We flipped the switch abruptly in mid October, and for the most part, the rest of the fall season experienced below normal temperatures. We had a stretch of near record cold temperatures in the middle of October and several more stretches in November. Our typical highs in the 60s and 70s just weren’t there this year.\" In the Henderson-Evansville area, there were only 28 days in the fall with high temperatures in the 60s or 70s. \"There have only been one or two other fall seasons on record to have fewer such 'comfortable' days,\" according to the NWS.\n\nNo. 10, Early snow/ice: A rare early season winter storm impacted the region on Nov. 14 and into Nov. 15.

In Green Bay, Wisconsin, an effort to push a similar citywide measure there was narrowly defeated this month.\n\nAnd in Florida, Republican state Rep. David Borrero has introduced a bill that would similarly limit flag displays at all governmental and public school buildings statewide.\n\nHow do these measures ban Pride flags?\n\nThe municipal measures that prohibit rainbow flags aren't explicitly expressed as such. Presented as a means to avoid favoring any one group over another, they limit flag displays to government and military flags – but the effect is the same.\n\nIn the measure in Delaware, Ohio, city manager Thomas Homan in May 2022 informed flag and banner applicants that the city was pausing its program for review in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that month ruling that Boston city officials had violated a Christian group’s free speech rights when they denied a request to fly a Christian flag over city hall. Delaware’s program allowed organizations to request their flags be displayed on city street poles.\n\n“While unfortunate for our local nonprofit organizations who use the banner and flag program to support cultural and community events, it is reasonable and prudent to take this step to protect the interests of our city,” he wrote.\n\nA city spokesman told USA TODAY the review was ongoing.\n\nOn March 7, City Council members in Huntington Beach, California, are set to take their final vote on a similar measure.\n\nAt the council's meeting earlier this week, board member Dan Kalmick criticized the proposal as cloaked in language hiding its true intentions.\n\n\"This is a poor and cowardly ordinance couched in 'equality,' \" Kalmick said. \"It’s, of course, a ban on the city flying the Pride flag. Call it what it is. ... If it walks like a ban and quacks like a ban, it’s a ban.\"\n\nTwo previous council votes have favored the ordinance 4-3. The proposed measure notes that businesses and individuals can still display flags of their choice on private property.\n\nLast week, Debbie Chang, president and CEO of the private foundation funded by nonprofit health plan Blue Shield of California, informed Huntington Beach officials that given the situation, the group had canceled plans to conduct a two-day retreat for trustees and senior management in the city in June.\n\n“We decided that we could no longer in good conscience meet in your city until the uncertainty of this situation is resolved,” Chang wrote in a letter Friday.\n\nGiven the LGBTQ community’s high rates of health inequities and domestic violence, she said, the city's move to ban the Pride flag \"puts a vulnerable population at risk of further harm.”\n\nIn response, Huntington Beach council member Casey McKeon said at this week's meeting: \"I don’t know why they are trying to blackmail us economically when we are drafting our government flag policy to only fly government flags that represent every individual equally.\"\n\nWhy is the rainbow flag important?\n\nGilbert Baker, a Kansas-born artist who spent much of his life in San Francisco, created the iconic six-striped rainbow flag in 1978 at the behest of LGBTQ activist and lawmaker Harvey Milk in 1978, according to the New York-based Gilbert Baker Foundation. He died in 2017.\n\nThe symbol has since become an icon of LGBTQ inclusion.\n\n“It’s that age-old visibility, of knowing where you’re welcome,” said Adkison, of TransOhio. “The Pride flag is an easy way of knowing you have some allies there.”\n\nPeg Corley, executive director of LGBTQ Center OC, based in Santa Ana, California, said Huntington Beach council members were sending \"a very loud message\" by considering the measure.\n\nThe rainbow flag “is the most diverse symbol we have,” Corley said. “Literally every walk of life is represented in the LGBTQ community, so saying we’re not going to fly a symbol of diversity and inclusion – that’s the message they’re sending.”\n\nHow is the LGBTQ community responding?\n\nThe Gilbert Baker Foundation, the New York-based organization named for the flag's creator, on Friday launched a Save the Rainbow Flag campaign with instruction for local community advocates on mobilization and letter-writing activism, plus an open letter from the ACLU with legal arguments against flag restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake – right-wing groups want to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, and they’re starting with banning the rainbow flag,” Charley Beal, the foundation’s president, said in a press release.\n\nSome such bans have already been reversed – for instance, in Newberg, Oregon, where school board members last month rescinded a controversial 2021 measure prohibiting political signage, which had included the rainbow flag, after the measure was challenged by the ACLU.\n\nBut, Beal said, “every month brings a new threat to LGBTQ+ rights and equality. It’s time to stop the haters.”\n\nCorley, whose organization has been asked to participate in public raisings of the rainbow flag when Orange County municipalities kicked off Pride Month celebrations in previous years, said she expects more businesses to withdraw from Huntington Beach should the ban remain in effect.\n\n“We’re people, not a political agenda,” she said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWhat is the meaning of other LGBTQ+ flags?\n\nBook bans are on the rise.

Six days after the Cup-clincher on a once-in-a-lifetime beauty of a goal by Darren McCarty, after a gap-toothed Steve Yzerman hoisted the silver chalice, after coach Scotty Bowman skated a victory lap with the trophy and after metro Detroit celebrated wildly, yet peacefully, a limousine accident nearly killed defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, paralyzed masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov and severely injured defenseman Slava Fetisov. The tragedy cast a pall over Stanley Cup celebrations that slowly lifted as Hockey’s Holy Grail traveled the world — including its first visit to Russia and its second to Sweden — and popped up regularly in Michigan — from Clark Park in southwest Detroit to a charity softball game in Dearborn to a day of jet-skiing with The Captain on Lake St. Clair to William Beaumont Hospital to inspire the recoveries of Vladdie and Sergei in Royal Oak. Our 60-day series on the Red Wings’ run to their eighth Stanley Cup ends with how Stanley spent his summer vacation, whose names were engraved for posterity, how the Wings retooled for another Cup run and a personal remembrance from your author of these daily looks back at the two months that captivated Hockeytown like no other time.\n\nTo Russia with love: Nobody knew the backstory of the Wings’ Russian Five better than Keith Gave, a hockey writer at the Free Press from the early days of Mike Ilitch’s ownership through the 1997 Stanley Cup celebrations. A U.S. spy-turned-newsman, with as unique a resume as you ever will see, Gave traveled to the Russian in the early 1990s to document how the Wings managed to pry Sergei Fedorov, Slava Kozlov and Konstantinov from the Red Army and turn them into Red Wings. He returned in 1997 when Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Kozlov took the Stanley Cup to Mother Russia for its first visit. (Konstantinov was unable to make the trip because of his injuries from the limousine accident. Fedorov spent his summer embroiled in a contract dispute and following Anna Kournikova, a 16-year-old Russian phenom, on the tennis circuit with stops at Wimbledon and the US Open.) More than two decades later, Gave wrote “The Russian Five: A story of espionage, defection, bribery and courage.” It came out in March 2018, a month before “The Russian Five” documentary premiered at the Freep Film Festival. Gave served as a writer and a producer for the project. He spent six years in the Army as a Russian linguist during the Cold War before 40-plus years working in the news industry, sports-talk radio and writing books. The following excerpt from “Stanleytown 25 Years Later” was condensed from “The Russian Five”:\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman still lingered on the ice moments after Steve Yzerman handed the Stanley Cup to Slava Fetisov and Igor Larionov for a celebrated lap around Joe Louis Arena by the distinguished former Soviet stars. And after they handed it off to teammates for their special moments, Fetisov made a beeline over to the commissioner for a spur-of-the-moment appeal that he knew would not be well-received.\n\nWhich probably explained why it was delivered more as a statement than a request.\n\n“Gary, you know I’m going to need the Cup in Moscow now,” Fetisov said.\n\n“No way. Absolutely not!” the commissioner responded.\n\n“Yes, this is my right after we win.”\n\nSince 1989, a tradition had evolved regarding the Stanley Cup celebrations after the champion was crowned. Each player on the winning team could have the trophy for a day or two, depending on seniority, which produced some unprecedented goodwill throughout North America as the Cup made its rounds. Fetisov knew long before he ever won it exactly what he would do with his time.\n\n“No, no, no!” Bettman said. “There’s too much crime in Russia now. It’s too dangerous.”\n\nMoscow, once among the safest cities in the world, was changing. The Communist KGB had lost its iron grip and its replacement, the FSB (Federal Security Service), was still finding its way in a rapidly changing Russian society under a succession of new leaders. Petty crime was prevalent, if not rampant, and serious crime was no longer uncommon.\n\nAdding to the country’s woes, the Russian mafia — a term used to loosely describe a collective of various organized crime elements — was growing exponentially in the absence of a strong police force. In other words, the NHL could not depend on civic law enforcement agencies to help protect the Stanley Cup.\n\nBettman knew all this, but Fetisov remained undeterred.\n\n“We can talk about it later,” he said, “but I need to take this Cup to Moscow.”\n\nAs it turned out, Fetisov got his wish — and Bettman’s anxieties were confirmed.\n\nStanley hits Red Square\n\nOn a dreary Saturday afternoon in August, a plane landed at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport carrying precious cargo. Fetisov was there with teammates Igor Larionov and Slava Kozlov to receive the Stanley Cup on its arrival in Russia. It was accompanied by several NHL executives and a large staff that naturally included Phil Pritchard, curator and self-proclaimed Keeper of the Cup from the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.\n\nPritchard opened a large trunk, lifted the burnished trophy out of its velvety cocoon and handed it to Fetisov, who turned and walked toward a chain-link fence. On the other side were several hundred of his countrymen who had come to celebrate this moment. They poked their fingers through the fence to touch the silver chalice and stamp their fingerprints on history. Later in the day, the Stanley Cup was given a place of honor at the Central Sport Club of the Army, CSKA headquarters of the Red Army hockey organization that produced all five players in Detroit’s Russian unit.\n\nIt was the first stop of a whirlwind tour for the most famous trophy in sports making its first visit to Russia. And Steele, then 46, was intent on making sure it stopped by his club to mingle with some passionate hockey fans.\n\n“Do you think you could convince those guys to bring the Cup here?” Steele asked me as we were enjoying a perfectly legal Cuban cigar. “I promise it will be worth their time. I’ve got some big plans if they can make it happen.”\n\nHe said he was willing to spend $10,000 transforming his bar into a replica combining the best traits of Joe Louis Arena and Olympia Stadium, complete with banners commemorating the Stanley Cup seasons and retired numbers of former Wings greats, as well as a copy of the Cup.\n\nI winced. I never liked asking athletes or coaches for favors beyond a few minutes for an interview, or a special sitting for a photograph to accompany a story for the Free Press.\n\nThe following morning, sunny but unusually cool and breezy for mid-August even in Moscow, Red Square was bustling. Tourists were there to visit the Kremlin behind the tall, red-brick wall, snap pictures of St. Basil’s Cathedral, perhaps the most recognizable church in the world, where czars once read their edicts. People also came to pay homage at the tomb of V.I. Lenin, the inspiration behind the Bolshevik Revolution and the first leader of the USSR. But many others were there because they had heard rumors that the famous hockey trophy from North America might be making an appearance.\n\n“It’s amazing to think of the Cup in Red Square,” said Todd Carmichael, who was there with Monique Couture, both attorneys from Ottawa, Ontario, working for a firm in Moscow. They were armed with a camera, posing in the foreground while players held the Stanley Cup near Lobnoye Mesto — the Place of Skulls — where 16th-century czar Ivan the Terrible was said to behead his rivals.\n\n“I never thought we’d see the day,” Carmichael said. “And the people of Moscow — the ones who know about it — are really pumped.”\n\nAmong them was Andrei Chursakov, a sergeant of the Kremlin guards who held an autographed photo of Fetisov, Larionov and Kozlov as they posed with the Cup. He was mesmerized by the star power in the photo and lamented the loss of most of Russia’s best players to the NHL.\n\n“I don’t watch as much hockey as before,” Chursakov said. “All the players have left. But I watch the NHL now so I can follow these guys. I’ll put this picture up at home, and I will look at it all the time.”\n\nThe players walked from place to place around the square as Kozlov, by far the youngest of the three, lugged the Cup. Each wore his Wings jersey. Fetisov also wore some of his other cherished hardware, including several gold medals. People would stop and stare. Not at the big trophy, but at the men accompanying it.\n\n“Oh my God, is that Fetisov?” one would whisper to another. “Yes, yes! That is Fetisov. And there’s Larionov, too!” And the crowd behind them would grow. The men who had brought so much joy to Russian hockey fans — the world championships, the Olympic gold medals and now even the Stanley Cup from North America — were right there among them in Red Square.\n\nFetisov saw the beauty of the moment in the eyes of the people he met there, and he knew he was right to insist to the leaders of the NHL that they consent to this tour with the Stanley Cup.\n\nNearly two decades later, it was the smiles he remembered most about those days with the trophy in Russia.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Fetisov said, “from first moment when Cup arrived on the plane and we meet it on the field after an international flight, you can see the smiles on the people, on the customs people, the policemen, the people who work in airports. You see the smiles and you realize we bring so much happiness to so many people.”\n\nAnd no one was more moved than Aleksandr Maximovich Fetisov, Slava’s father, who was 65 when the Cup visited Moscow.\n\n“I am so proud of Slava because now he has all the hockey trophies there are to have,” the elder Fetisov said. “And now he’s walking through Red Square with the Stanley Cup!”\n\nFather and son posed for pictures with the other players and a few of us from the media at Lenin’s tomb. Slava Fetisov was in high spirits when I tentatively broached the subject of taking the Cup to The Hungry Duck.\n\n“What do you think about bringing the Cup to this wild and crazy club we’ve discovered here in Moscow, Slava?” I asked. And then I told him about the bar, its reputation and its fanatical owner.\n\n“Yeah, sure, why not?” he said.\n\n“Seriously?” I said, thinking of plenty of reasons why not. “What about the league? They’re going to fight you on it.”\n\n“We will be there,” Fetisov said. “I want to see this place. … Sometime after 11 o’clock, OK?”\n\nBy early that Sunday evening, The Hungry Duck looked a lot more like Joe Louis Arena than a notorious Moscow nightclub. And it was beyond packed. “The interest in the NHL is huge here,” Steele said, “because of the Russian players over there now. The Rangers were the most popular, but now it’s Detroit. It’s all about where the Russians are playing.”\n\nSteele had roped off a VIP area, where he joined reporters and a few of his friends as we waited for the Cup’s arrival. And waited. And waited some more. When 11 p.m. passed, I shrugged it off; players are typically late for things like this. Midnight came and went, and now I was wondering whether something had gone wrong. The crowd was getting a little restless, too, but no one was leaving.\n\nSteele began to speculate that NHL officials had pulled the plug on this visit, and it probably wasn’t going to happen. My head wanted to agree with him, but my heart wasn’t so sure. Let’s be patient. Fetisov was nothing if not a man of his word, and if he said he’d be here with the Stanley Cup, then he would be.\n\nFinally, well past 1 a.m., a murmur grew to a roar as Kozlov approached from a back entrance holding the most recognizable sports trophy in the world. Steele gave me a quick look and a nod, his eyes reflecting surprise, relief and unmitigated joy. The Stanley Cup was in his bar, brought to him by three stars of the team he idolized as a boy. Close behind Kozlov were Fetisov and Larionov, waving to a wildly exuberant crowd. Immediately behind them were several NHL officials, nervously scanning the room for trouble.\n\nThey were uneasy, obviously, because they had done their due diligence and knew that The Duck had a rather checkered reputation. Since Steele took over the bar on March 15, 1996, a few months after its doors opened, until the day he closed it on March 15, 1999, police had opened 256 criminal cases involving The Hungry Duck. Network television filmed inside the bar on 43 occasions, and three motion pictures shot scenes there. The Duck was raided frequently, and one night 79 patrons were arrested on suspicion of narcotics, according to Steele. All were subsequently released without charge.\n\nBut the night the Stanley Cup made its visit, Aug. 17, 1997, the massive crowd celebrated without an incident. The Free Press had supplied me with several hundred placards featuring its now iconic photo of the Russian Five in profile. It was used for promotional purposes in newsstands, and people were lined up at the VIP area getting them signed by three of those men in the picture.\n\nAmong them: those burly KGB thugs, those modern-day Cossacks hired to maintain order and protect the Cup and those who brought it. They were rendered speechless as these great former Soviet hockey stars signed the placards. The biggest, scariest-looking one of them all was sobbing like a baby.\n\nHome sweet home\n\nTwo days later, the Stanley Cup continued its tour at the Podmoskovie Sports Palace in Voskresensk, otherwise known as Hockeytown East, hometown of Larionov and Kozlov. They grew up a few blocks from one another in a community about a 90-minute drive from Red Square. The gleaming 4,500-seat arena with stained-glass windows also served as a veritable museum honoring the history of the local professional club, Khimik Voskresensk. The citizens of Voskresensk were all there to see Russia’s hockey royalty and this magnificent trophy they called Kubok Stenli.\n\nIt was an emotional moment, for Larionov especially.\n\n“The Russian players were a big part of the success in Detroit,” he said. “We got the trophy, and we decided this is the way. We were proud to bring the Stanley Cup to Russia and share the experience and history of the Cup with the fans who had been behind us for the past two seasons in Detroit.”\n\nLarionov’s entire family was there. So was Kozlov’s. Their former coaches and mentors were there, too, along with several hundred young hockey players among thousands of others.\n\n“It was a great feeling for us to share this moment with them,” Larionov said. “And it was very nice of the NHL to let us take the Cup home to Moscow.”\n\nThe Stanley Cup had made a glorious maiden tour around Russia’s capital city and suddenly, the chill between two long-standing global rivals felt a little warmer.\n\n“We start a new life in the history of the Stanley Cup,” Fetisov said. “We cross the border into the Russian Federation, and now it’s part of the culture in Russian sport, too.”\n\nNot back in the USSR: During the summer, each Red Wing got some personal time with the Stanley Cup, and it traveled everywhere from Sweden to the Soo. At the start of training camp at Traverse City, Helene St. James compiled the tales of Round Stanley. Here are a few of those answers:\n\nMartin Lapointe: He took the Stanley Cup to Ville Ste-Pierre, Quebec, near Montreal, where the town had a parade for him. He took the Cup to a hospital to show it to the father of his sister’s friend. Within a week of the visit, the man died of cancer. Lapointe also took the Cup to a camp for intellectually and developmentally challenged children. He had pictures taken of his 16-month-old son, Guyot, “buck naked and sitting in the Cup.”\n\nBrendan Shanahan: “For all the time I spent parading it around and holding it above my head in front of hundreds of people, my favorite memory was of a Saturday afternoon in Toronto, when I took it to my father’s grave,” Shanahan said. “For a Saturday afternoon, the place was totally empty. I just sat there with it. That was my favorite moment.” Shanahan’s father, Donal, died of Alzheimer’s disease several years earlier. Shanahan also displayed the Cup for hours for fans as part of an Alzheimer’s fundraiser in Dearborn, which included a softball game in which Wings players (and Zamboni driver Al S0botka) destroyed a media team (with the starting battery of Free Press beat reporter Jason La Canfora on the mound and sports editor Gene Myers behind the dish).\n\nSteve Yzerman: “We did a lot of everything,” he said. “When you have that trophy around, you don’t sleep a whole lot. We had a couple of parties with it. We had it out on Lake St. Clair. I think my favorite part was when we took it to Ottawa to my parents’ home and invited over some of the guys I grew up playing hockey with, some of my coaches on teams I played on when I was 10 and 11 that I haven’t seen in quite a while.”\n\nKirk Maltby: He took it to a couple of restaurants in Cambridge, Ontario, and had it at his parents’ house for a bit. He also took it to the pediatrics center at a hospital. He then had a party for 300 people. “That night, I slept with it in my bed,” he said. “I had to clean it because it absolutely reeked. I don’t want to tell you what time in the morning it was, but I was there with a little cloth wiping it clean. The guy who takes care of it was in bed long ago, so I had to take care of it on my own. I shined it up.”\n\nJoe Kocur: “We had some friends over, we partied all night, and when the sun came up, we went fishing,” he said. His favorite part of having the Cup was sharing it with friends in Michigan — and his beer-league buddies. “Just the chance to have all my friends who’ve lived in Detroit all these years, waiting for a Stanley Cup, to give them a chance to drink out of it, get a picture with it,” Kocur said. “The over-30 team I played with last year at this time, they were all over. We had a team picture taken with the Stanley Cup. The best picture I got was, when you win the Stanley Cup they give you a replica, it’s about 16 to 18 inches high, and my daughter was drinking out of that one and I was drinking out of the main one.”\n\nDarren McCarty: He threw a party for the Cup and took it home to show his parents and brought it over to the arena in Leamington, Ontario, where he played while growing up. He took it out with his buddies, who played in a band, and “jammed with it.” He also had a professional photographer take pictures of his son Griffin with the Cup.\n\nTomas Holmstrom: He took it to his hometown of Pitea, Sweden, which is close to Lapland. He showed it to friends and family and said it helped make for one of the best summers he had ever had.\n\nNicklas Lidstrom: He had a public viewing of the Cup in Vasteras, Sweden, where he played hockey before coming to Detroit. Then he took the Cup to a public viewing in his hometown of Avesta, where his parents still lived, and threw a party for the Cup. He posed for pictures with the Cup with sons Kevin and Adam. He then put Adam in the Cup and took pictures.\n\nChris Osgood: After arriving in Medicine Hat, Osgood had a big party. He took the Cup to the rink where he played as a youngster. He took it to his parents’ house and showed it to friends. “I had it for two days and got no sleep,” he said. “It was a good time. We had fun.”\n\nKris Draper: “My favorite moment was the excitement of seeing my dad hold the Cup,” he said. “For all the hard work and support your parents give you, to see the excitement they have with it was great. But there was a point in the night that I had to let my dad know that I was the one who won it. He was there for me, but I was the one who won it. I had it next to me in bed, but I didn’t sleep.”\n\nOff the ice: The Wings elected to chase a second straight Stanley Cup in 1997-98 with essentially the same roster. But there were plenty of bumps in the road and plenty of second-guessing on their decisions. They lost center Tim Taylor, the leader of the Black Aces, in the waiver draft. For grit, they added left wing Brent Gilchrist as free agent from Dallas, their top competitor in the Central Division. They planned bigger roles for Tomas Holmstrom, an awkward-skating Swedish wing who relished battling in front of the net; forward Mike Knuble, brought up late the previous season as part of the team’s commitment to get younger and bigger; and defenseman Anders Eriksson, a former first-round pick with size (6-feet-3, 225 pounds) expected to help fill the Konstantinov void.\n\nAll these moves, however, paled when compared to the Big Three, which involved the front office, the goaltending situation and the best two-way player. After ending his speech at the televised rally for season-ticket holders at The Joe with “we’ll come back next year and do it again,” Scotty Bowman made it official: He wanted to return for a fifth season. He signed a two-year contract to coach with a raise to nearly $1 million a season. But he lost his powers as director of player personnel. Those went to Ken Holland, who was promoted from assistant general manager to GM. His boss remained Jimmy Devellano, the direct link to Mike Ilitch. Bowman kept Dave Lewis and Barry Smith as his associate coaches.\n\nIn Holland’s biggest move, he traded Mike Vernon, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner for his stellar play between the pipes, and a fifth-round draft pick to the San Jose Sharks for a pair of second-round picks. After a 13-victory regular season, Vernon’s contract was to expire following the playoffs. But his 16 victories en route to the Stanley Cup triggered a clause that gave him an additional season for a little more than $2 million. Vernon, seemingly embroiled in continuous contract disputes during his three seasons in Detroit, wanted more money and more years. The Wings didn’t want to provide either, and they also did not want to face losing Chris Osgood (at $1.6 million) or Kevin Hodson (at $400,000) in the waiver draft. So, for the third time in their history, the Wings did what no other NHL team had done: Trade its No. 1 goalie after he won the finals. Detroit’s past three starters to win the Cup — Vernon (1997) and Hall of Famers Terry Sawchuk (1955) and Harry Lumley (1950) — were dealt before the start of the next season. Lumley was traded to Chicago to make room for Sawchuk, who won three Cups with the Wings. Sawchuk was dealt to Boston make room for Glenn Hall, a 24-year-old; and the latest torch was passed to Osgood, another 24-year-old. (Osgood was more than up to the task: He backstopped Cup-winning teams in 1998 and again a decade later and came within a victory of another Cup in 2009.)\n\nVernon’s contract issues were nothing compared to Sergei Fedorov’s. For more than a year, the Wings and Fedorov, a restricted free agent, remained far apart on a new contract for the former Hart Trophy winner who had notched 20 points in three straight playoff runs and played his best, and grittiest, hockey ever in 1997 despite a severe rib injury. He reportedly wanted $6 million a year; the Wings were willing to spent $4.5 million a year. So, he held out when training camp opened. He worked out with the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League, owned by Peter Karmanos, a Detroiter who also owned the Carolina Hurricanes and was a longtime rival of the Ilitches in junior hockey circles. Fedorov still was holding out when the Nagano Olympics rolled around in February, so he went to Japan and won a silver medal with the Russians. He told a Russian newspaper: “I made a decision in August and still haven’t changed it. They think they can break me with the help of some financial tricks, but they don’t know the kind of person I am. They don’t know who they are messing with.” Holland reiterated he had no intention of trading Fedorov for less than equal value. In stepped Karmanos. His Hurricanes signed Fedorov to an offer sheet for six years and $38 million. It included a $14 million signing bonus, a $2 million annual salary and $12 million in additional, automatic payments. Karmanos planted a poison pill to scare off the Wings: The $12 million in additional payments would be paid in $3 million installments — unless the team made the conference finals, in which case the entire $12 million was due July 1. The Wings had seven days to match the offer, try to work out a trade with Carolina or decline the offer and receive the Hurricanes’ next five first-round draft choices. Detroit cried foul, as Holland said, because the offer sheet was “structured to try to deter the Red Wings from matching.” The league agreed, but an arbitrator disagreed. Back on the clock after the Feb. 26 ruling, the Wings matched the offer right away. “It was an easy decision on the part of our ownership to make,” Holland said. “We’re a much better hockey club with Sergei.”\n\nFamous last words: Let me introduce myself. I am Gene Myers, a former sports editor at the Free Press, and each night for the last two months I have spent an hour or two or three or four trying to capture the day’s events as the Detroit Red Wings marched through the 1997 playoffs to end their 42-year Stanley Cup drought. It was a labor of love, despite much of it spent in the wee hours.\n\nAlong the way, I once again could feel the excitement, agony and glory of that incredible spring a quarter-century ago. And I hope that these 60 installments along the way come to be viewed as the definitive day-by-day account of the 1997 playoffs, to be dusted off and reposted at freep.com to mark the 30th, 35th, 40th, 45th and 50th anniversaries. By that time, I’ll be 87 years old, and 32 years from the day I retired after 32 years at the Free Press, the last 22½ as sports editor.\n\nToday’s installment ends this two-month project. But, really, I have spent more than six months over the past year immersed in the 1996-97 Red Wings, as a writer, editor and researcher. In 2021, my spring and summer were consumed spearheading “Stanleytown 25 Years Later,” the Free Press’ 208-page, full-color collector’s book that should be a must for all serious Wings fans. The book soon will be out of print, it’s only $29.95, I don’t have a financial stake in sales and the ordering information follows below.\n\nIn the rush to finish that book, I never found the time to do two things: 1. Properly thank the folks who lent hands as large as the downtown Fist statue. 2> Tell my hockey story, as I let several writers do in the book.\n\nSince this might be the last thing I ever write about these 1997 Wings, please indulge me as I do so now.\n\nI kissed the Stanley Cup — and kept my eyes open.\n\nI stood in the stands next to Joy Osgood, Chris’ mother, as Patrick Roy challenged her son to a fight. (She couldn’t bear to watch, but after her son landed a few blows, she was chanting like the rest of the arena, “Oz-zie! Oz-zie! Oz-zie!”)\n\nI even have scored goals in recreational games in an empty Joe Louis Arena — and imagined the cheers of 20,066 fans.\n\nMy hockey story, I suppose, begins when the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams in the late 1960s. I was born in cookie pollution— that is, just a bit downwind from a giant NABISCO factory in the northeast section of Philadelphia. My hometown suddenly had the Flyers, and hockey games were shown on a grainy UHF station. In my neighborhood packed with other Baby Boomers, we started playing street hockey but plastic equipment was scarce and costly. My first stick was a wooden field hockey stick my mother used in college, which was nicknamed The Club. Wooden sticks didn’t fare well on asphalt streets, so we also used roll after roll of duct tape.\n\nYou couldn’t get tickets to see the Flyers, so my parents took their four kids — I was the oldest, born in 1960 — across the Delaware River to watch the minor-league Jersey Devils of the old Eastern Hockey League. I recall their games featured fights galore. I was about 11 years old the only time I saw the Flyers in person. Somehow, we had seats in the front row in a corner, and my sister Terry was thrilled beyond belief when she could jump up and bang the glass when players collided along the boards. My mother told her to stop it, but she was uncontrollable and said she learned to do that watching games on television.\n\nI was devastated when, halfway through my eighth-grade year in 1973-74, my family moved to Kansas, a few miles from the border with Kansas City, Missouri. For starters, the Flyers were becoming a powerhouse known as the Broad Street Bullies. On the Great Plains, hockey telecasts were few and far between as the local affiliate would preempt the coverage provided by NBC and Peter Puck.\n\nIn May 1974, Kate Smith sang “God Bless America” in person at Philadelphia’s Spectrum, and the inspired Flyers beat Boston, 1-0, in Game 6 to become the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. In May 1975, the Bullies repeated, beating the Buffalo Sabres in six games, despite an overtime loss in the famous fog game early in the series. I remember watching part of the series on Kansas City’s PBS station, which begged for pledges between periods.\n\nAt least in the fall of 1974 the NHL expanded again with its 17th and 18th teams — the Kansas City Scouts and the Washington Capitals. Led by general manager Sid Abel, a legendary Red Wings player, coach, GM and later broadcaster, the Scouts were beyond horrible. They finished 15-54-11 for 41 points — the same additional number of points they needed to make the playoffs. They were outscored, 328-184. They started 0-8-1 before their first victory. They ended with one victory in their final 19 games.\n\nThe only highlights were a thrilling 7-6 loss at KC’s new Kemper Arena to the Montreal Canadiens, and a 3-1 record against the Capitals, who were even worse. Washington managed only 21 points with a 8-67-5 record and was outscored, 446-181.\n\nAbel’s Scouts somehow found a way to lose more games in their second season. They went 12-56-12 for 36 points — the same additional number of points they needed to make the playoffs. They were outscored, 351-190. From Dec. 30 until the season’s end, the Scouts won one game — yes, one game! — and, of course, it was against the Capitals. The Scouts finished their season on a 1-35-8 streak and then bolted for Denver to become the Colorado Rockies (and a few years later the New Jersey Devils, in time for Wayne Gretzky to call the franchise a “Mickey Mouse organization” that was “ruining the whole league”).\n\nWhen the Scouts arrived in town, a rink was built that they used for practices at times. Youth teams, recreational teams, figure skating and open skating also filled the ice time. For Christmas, I asked for skates and with my Bobby Orr signature blades, I tried to learn to skate before my 15th birthday. I failed.\n\nHockey pretty much didn’t exist for me for my last two years of high school and my five years at the University of Kansas. But in 1982, the Detroit Free Press selected this proud Jayhawk to be an intern on the copy desk in the Sports Department. For a summer, I lived in a dorm at the University of Windsor, commuted over the Ambassador Bridge and pretty much edited every Red Wings story. That’s because even though pizza baron Mike Ilitch had purchased the franchise from old-money Bruce Norris right as I arrived, my fellow copy editors were sick and tired of the Dead Wings era.\n\nA year later, the Free Press hired me right out of college. And I moved into my eastside Detroit flat in time for the Wings to draft a young centerman from the Ottawa suburbs whose name no one knew how to pronounce. And, once again, I edited the bulk of the Wings stories.\n\nThat fall, I made my first visit to Joe Louis Arena. I was not impressed. By the building. By the team. And by the number of fans urinating in the sinks in the men’s room between periods.\n\nBut Ilitch improved the warehouse on the waterfront and, eventually, the Winged Wheel on the ice. I was part of a season-ticket consortium. And I wondered whether the Wings ever would be capable of beating the Edmonton Oilers and winning their first Stanley Cup since 1955. But there were plenty of exciting moments as they failed, especially because of Steve Yzerman.\n\nIn 1988, right after the Calgary Winter Olympics, and nearly five years since I arrived in Detroit, I purchased a pair of cheap figure skates from Sears, signed up for a beginner class at St. Clair Shores Civic Arena and finally learned to skate — at least in one direction, with the on-again, off-again ability to stop. I played hockey for the first time on a frozen lake in Oakland County. I rented the ice in the wee hours at St. Clair Shores and we started playing weekly pickup games with minimal equipment, a sponge puck and goalies without stakes. It was a blast.\n\nA year later I formed a Free Press team in a twice-a-week morning league in Fraser. We were out of our league, like Harvard competing in the SEC. All our players were college graduates, college dropouts or in college, and we routinely were destroyed by a team of construction workers and a team proud to be comprised of the chronically unemployed. But Team Freep improved when I recruited an ex-con and a couple of GEDers and adopted the team-building motto I still use to this day: “younger, faster, dumber.”\n\nI was finally a hockey player. Not a great one. Not a good one. But a player. As a right wing, I could take up space on the defensive end and charge the net and knock home the occasional garbage goal on the offensive end. Years later, when we finally won a “title,” our cheap plastic trophies meant as much to me as Lord Stanley’s chalice.\n\nHockey fever was so rampant as the Wings improved in the 1990s that we started an annual game pitting the Free Press against the Detroit News. Note: I considered the News a worthy competitor but my Forever Enemy. One year, while I was camped in front of the goal, Bryan Gruley of the News put his stick between my legs and tried, ahem, to jostle my private parts. I spun around cursing, raised my stick as high as possible and delivered a vicious B.C. two-hander to the back of his knees. All hell then broke loose on the ice, and the benches emptied. Some of our bosses weren’t too happy; others were thrilled. Hours later at the Anchor Bar, as both teams drank to fun times, the video of the game clearly showed my dirty deed but not Gruley’s.\n\nWhen I became sports editor in February 1993, it wasn’t so easy to play in the mornings so I became a hockey nomad at night. I played until 2008 when a lingering neck injury — and a doctor’s warning that I probably wouldn’t sustain serious damage if I kept playing — caused me to retire. But I returned in January 2018 at the Ann Arbor Ice Cube, to run a team of free agents in a Friday night Never Ever league, the lowest of levels. In our first calendar year, we won two games — the second of which was via forfeit. But we slowly improved, finished first in a short summer league, finished first again when COVID-19 ended a season early and, up a level at long last, won the playoffs this past winter for a giant, cheap plastic trophy. April, 2022 (Oh, What a Night)! Alas, we are 1-2-3 as the spring season winds down. At least to improve this time, I didn’t need to go dumber, just younger and faster. Our team, called the Yaks, one of a series teams at different levels using the same name while playing out of The Cube, has included a concussion expert, a rocket scientist, engineers, IT specialists, nurses, researchers and one retired journalist.\n\nBack to 1997. I controlled a ticket consortium. So, I had my pick games.\n\nTime to dispel a myth: Sports staffers do not accept free tickets to games. By choice, I rarely spent much time in press boxes. I always figured there were three types of sportswriters there: 1) Those who would suck up to me in hopes of landing a job down the road. 2) Those who wanted to punch me because I didn’t hire them at some point. 3) My staffers who didn’t need their boss hovering over their shoulders. At one point or another, I had at least partial season tickets to the Wings, Tigers, Lions, Pistons, Michigan football and Michigan State football.\n\nIn 1997, my Wings tickets were about 10 rows up in a corner of the upper bowl. They were right next to two controlled by Osgood, which was how I met his mother the night of his 1998 slugfest with Roy.\n\nSo, naturally, I used the tickets in ’97 for the two most famous games in The Joe’s history: Fight Night at The Joe on March 26 and the Stanley Cup clincher on June 7.\n\nI have three other indelible memories from the 1997 championship season. The Saturday night the Wings won the Cup, I arrived in the Free Press’ downtown offices around 2 p.m., six hours before face-off. Staffers were working on an instant commemorative book that needed to be finished within 12 hours of the final buzzer if the Wings won the championship. At that point, we weren’t even sure what the book’s title would be. Around midnight, it became the original “Stanleytown.”\n\nIn the afternoon, I was checking on a preprinted edition that would be sold outside Joe Louis Arena if the Wings won. We used the big headline of “OUR CUP” and giant photo of Brendan Shanahan celebrating a goal in Game 3. I helped a bit with the book. And I planned out a 20-page commemorative section that would run Monday morning if the Wings won.\n\nThe game itself was thrilling and nerve-wracking. Despite a three-games-to-none lead in the series, hey, anything can happen and had to the Wings in the past four decades. Also, for my job, all the plans were in place for the Free Press’ coverage. I didn’t want to create a new plan for Game 5. And a clinching game at home was far easier to cover by flooding the zone with staffers than a clinching game on the road. No matter what, I did not want to series to return to my hometown.\n\nAnd thanks to Darren McCarty’s amazing goal, the Wings held on for a 2-1 victory. The atmosphere inside The Joe was insane. As it was once fans started heading outside. When I did, I grabbed piles of the “OUR CUP” special editions and started hawking them. Fans couldn’t buy ’em fast enough.\n\nWhen I made it back to the office through the sea of humanity, it must have been closing in on 12:30 a.m. A dozen or so folks were working on the “Stanleytown” book, editing stories from The Joe for freep.com and starting on Monday’s commemorative section. I worked on all three throughout the night and into the next morning. With the book finished, I worked exclusively on Monday’s section. When that finished around 8 p.m. Sunday, I started planning coverage for the rest of the week, which besides a parade now included a rally at The Joe. I finally left at 4 a.m. Monday — 38 hours after my arrival. Crazy, eh? No excuses during the playoffs, right? Who needs sleep, anyway?\n\nMy second indelible moment came near summer’s end, when Shanahan staged a celebrity softball game in Dearborn to raise money to fight Alzheimer’s, which had taken his father several years earlier. Fans lined up for hours for their chance to visit with the Stanley Cup. And, to my chagrin, way too many of them watched the softball game.\n\nNobody really wanted to see a game. Folks just wanted to see their Red Wings heroes up close and watch them smack the living daylights out of the ball. A team of “media celebrities” was supposed to be the Washington Generals.\n\nWhen a PR person requested that I play in the game, I declined and said nobody wanted to see me in action. The PR person agreed that was true but wanted me anyway. She also wanted Jason La Canfora, the rookie Wings beat reporter for the Free Press.\n\nOn the softball diamond, I figured how why. The PR person asked me to try to organize two dozen media members into a team. There were plenty of big egos involved. There were only I’s on this team. The PR person had one more request: The Wings wanted La Canfora to be the starting pitcher.\n\nSo, I did my best crafting a lineup and figuring out what body type looked like it could play which position. It was a waste of time: Nobody was very good.\n\nI put myself at catcher figuring it would be easier to watch my teammates from there and it would be best place to try to help La Canfora. He was just a year out Syracuse and had joined the Free Press late in the season and had impressed everyone, including the Wings, which is why they wanted to light him up. It was a badge of honor.\n\nLa Canfora has had a spectacular 25-year career that started in Detroit. He moved to the Washington Post to cover the football team no longer called the Redskins, then the NFL Network and later CBS Sports. He hosted a radio show, too.\n\nFor a quarter-century, La Canfora has been a triple threat — with the written word, on radio and on television. He’s all those things. He wasn’t a pitcher, though.\n\nGiven time for a quick warm-up, he struggled to come within several feet of home plate. The Wings were good-naturedly razzing him. His first several pitches weren’t in the same time zone. When Wings came to the plate, I all but begged them to swing at anything close. And they did.\n\nThey bashed the ball, even Zamboni driver Al Sobotka, which thrilled the fans. Somehow the media celebs got out of the inning down only by double digits. The Wings did the same thing in the second inning. Everybody was having fun, or so it seemed.\n\nMy embarrassment came after I singled and then tried to advance to third base on another hit, a rarity for my team. Halfway between second and third my uniform pants, which were several sizes too big, started falling down. Way down. I yanked them up and kinda hopped into third safely. The PA announcer was kind to point out my wardrobe malfunction to the laughing fans. Thank goodness for compression shorts!\n\nThe following inning brought a confrontation with rookie defenseman Aaron Ward. At 6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, he towered over me. He had made a reputation in the Stanley Cup playoffs for delivering big open-ice hits. He had a bit of a cult following despite coach Scotty Bowman playing him sparingly.\n\nFor reasons I failed to understand, Ward had not swung at a pitch in his two previous at-bats. I figured he was waiting for something in his zone to drive a country mile. I politely told Ward that La Canfora was unlikely to throw a pitch anywhere near the plate, that he should cream any pitch he could reach and that the fans weren’t there to watch him walk.\n\nWard just glared at me — and walked again on four pitches. Whatever, I thought. And I didn’t give it another thought.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Ward score. No surprise there. How he scored shocked me. He slowed down as he neared the plate, stomped both feet on it and growled at me, “Take that, (expletive).” (I was taught at KU’s journalism school to never use this word in print. Let’s just say the first part includes an m, an o, a t, an h, an e and a r.) He wasn’t joking around. He was furious with me.\n\nWhen I figured that out, I remembered saying “you’re kidding, right?” and backing away to diffuse the situation. I am certain parts of me were trembling.\n\nWhen Shanahan came to bat, he asked what was up between Ward and me. I told him about his at-bat and his stomp, and Shanahan called Ward something I won’t print, apologized on behalf of the Wings and thanked me for organizing the media celebrities. I thanked him for the invite, for raising money for a charity and for sharing the Stanley Cup with the masses.\n\nBetween innings, I’m happy to report, I saw Shanahan giving the business to Ward.\n\nAfter that, Myers and La Canfora retreated to the bench for the remainder of the biggest rout since the Christians versus the Lions.\n\nMy third indelible moment came not long after the softball game. The Ilitches allowed the Stanley Cup to go on visits to downtown businesses and someone, somehow had gotten the Free Press on the list. The Keeper of the Cup placed the trophy on a table in a large room, and my coworkers waited their turn to check it out up close and to snap a few photos. I waited my turn with Steve Schrader, an assistant sports editor and the author of the Octometer. Schrader wasn’t tall, but he was solidly built, an offensive lineman back in his high school days. He didn’t see the Keeper hovering nearby, so he reached down and hoisted Lord Stanley’s chalice. I snapped a photo. Then he turned to hand Hockey’s Holy Gail to me, and I held it in front of my chest.\n\nYes, it was heavy. Heavier than I expected. Plenty of places listed its weight at 35 to 37 pounds. John Wharton, the Wings’ trainer at the time, insisted he weighed the Cup twice and it checked in at 32 pounds. In addition, the trophy required a wingspan wider than mine.\n\nI used all my (limited) might to lift Stanley over my head. For maybe a few seconds. I felt like I’d drop it — but not add to its lore — if I couldn’t reach the table ASAP. Fortunately for me and the Hockey Hall of Fame, someone else positioned himself to receive the Cup. The handoff occurred not long before the Keeper, probably with a sixth sense about his job, reappeared and demanded the Cup go back on the table.\n\nIn 2008, when the Wings won their 11th Stanley Cup, I ran afoul again with the Keeper. Before the Cup was put on display for employees, the Free Press publisher, a Jayhawk like me, invited a couple other Jayhawks for a private audience and photos. That’s when I kissed the Cup. And that’s when I put two books written after the 2002 Cup into Stanley’s bowl and snapped a few photos. The Keeper was livid and said the Hall of Fame did not allow the Cup to be used for promotional purposes. (Unless, of course, you are a big-time sponsor.) I swore I would never do that. And I didn’t. I just framed a photo and put it in my office. (It makes its public debut right now!)\n\nAin’t hockey the best sport? You betcha. That’s why I’ll be on the ice for a Yaks game at 11:55 p.m. Friday in Ann Arbor. That’s why I’ve devoted months to the 1996-97 Red Wings.\n\nAnd that’s why I need to thank a village of people. It all starts with Free Press sports editor Kirkland Crawford, who began working in my Sports Department while at Detroit’s Renaissance High and who greenlighted “Stanleytown 25 Years Later” and the 60 installments about the 1997 playoffs. Then there’s deputy sports editor Ryan Ford, the best designer and headline writer in the business. And there’s my cross-country skiing buddy and fellow retiree, Owen Davis, the ace copy chief in an era in which so many don’t value editing.\n\nI relished researching all the great writing and reporting from the Free Press in 1997, led by Keith Gave, Jason La Canfora, Helene St. James, Mitch Albom, Steve Schrader and the late Drew Sharp. The photo all-stars were Mary Schroeder and Julian H. Gonzalez — each of whom has been inducted into the Michigan Journalism Hall of Fame — with plenty of support from Gabriel B. Tait and Kirthmon F. Dozier.\n\nAlso deserving of shoutouts are Marlowe Alter, Tyler J. Davis, Andrew Hammond, Adam Engel, Bill Dow and Beth Myers.\n\nMost of all, I’m typing this while giving a standing ovation to the Free Press readers who return often — online and in print — for their Red Wings updates. And to those of you who already have purchased “Stanleytown 25 Years Later.”\n\nHere’s hoping we don’t have to wait until 2050 for the Spirit of Detroit to don a giant Winged Wheel jersey again. I desperately want to do another championship book.\n\nUntil then … Go, Yaks!\n\nRelive the glory: The Free Press has crafted a 208-page, full-color, hardcover collector’s book with fresh insights and dynamic storytelling about the 1996-97 Wings. It’s called “Stanleytown 25 Years Later: The Inside Story on How the Stanley Cup Returned to the Motor City after 41 Frustrating Seasons.” It’s only $29.95 and it’s available at RedWings.PictorialBook.com. (It’ll make a great Father’s Day gift for the Wings fanatic in your life!)\n\nMore to read: Another new Wings book arrived in April from Keith Gave, a longtime hockey writer for the Free Press in the 1980s and 1990s: “Vlad The Impaler: More Epic Tales from Detroit’s ’97 Stanley Cup Conquest.” It is available through Amazon and other booksellers and a portion of the proceeds is earmarked for the Vladimir Konstantinov Special Needs Trust. (Plenty of Gave’s prose also appears in “Stanleytown 25 Years Later.”)\n\nEven more to read: Red Wings beat reporter Helene St. James, who helped cover the 1997 Stanley Cup run, recently wrote “The Big 50: The Men and Moments That Made the Detroit Red Wings.” Featuring numerous tales about the key figures from 1997, “The Big 50” is available from Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Triumph Books.

Another state representative who was trailing a challenger said he will file an election contest in his GOP primary race after some voters in his district might have gotten the incorrect ballot. Republican state Sen. Tom Whatley of Auburn trailed primary rival Jay Hovey by a single vote after provisional ballots were counted Tuesday, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said. Hovey, a member of the Auburn City Council, had initially led by four votes, according to unofficial returns, but his lead shrank to a single vote after eligible provisional ballots were counted. Provisional ballots are votes for which there was initially a question about the voter’s eligibility. The vote is counted once that question is resolved. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said Whatley has 24 hours to request a recount if he chooses. Alabama provides automatic recounts in general elections. In a primary election, a candidate must request and pay for the recount. Meanwhile, unofficial returns showed Rep. Gill Isbell, R-Gadsden losing to Mack Butler, who previously served in the Legislature. But some voters got ballots with the wrong House district.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The owner of the largest natural gas utility in the state said it is selling the company to Canada-based TriSummit Utilities Inc. for $800 million. AltaGas Ltd. announced last Thursday that the sale includes Anchorage-based ENSTAR Natural Gas, associated pipelines and ENSTAR’s majority ownership in a gas storage facility, the Anchorage Daily News reports. AltaGas, also based in Canada, acquired Enstar in 2012. TriSummit has about 133,000 customers in Canada. ENSTAR, which has about 150,000 customers in Anchorage and parts of south-central Alaska, has had about 1% annual growth in customers in recent years, according to AltaGas. The company said the sale, in part, will allow it to reduce debt and make “higher growth investments” in other operations, the firm’s president, Randy Crawford, said in a statement. The sale is subject to regulatory approval. The companies expect it to close by early next year. TriSummit in a statement said it plans to “retain all of ENSTAR’s dedicated employees and hire new Alaska employees to perform certain functions currently performed out of state.” ENSTAR Natural Gas has about 200 employees.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Minority Democrats in the state Senate used a procedural move Tuesday to force a vote on legislation that would require background checks for any firearm purchase. The effort led to more than an hour of pleas from Democrats and pushback from Republicans, who for years have blocked all gun restrictions. All 16 Senate Republicans voted against the measure, while the 13 Democrats supported it. The bill, which never got a hearing, would have closed the so-called gun show loophole that allows someone to buy a gun without the federal background check that federally licensed firearms dealers are required to perform before a sale is completed. Republicans won’t even assign Democratic gun bills to a committee, meaning they never get hearings or a chance to get a formal floor vote. Democratic Sen. Martin Quezada bypassed that process to bring it right to the floor. “This isn’t a radical idea – this isn’t something that other states aren’t considering or even enacting,” Quezada said. He called requiring background checks for private gun purchases – anything except a transfer to a family member – a commonsense measure supported by overwhelmingly majorities of Americans that won’t prevent anyone legally allowed to have a gun from purchasing one. “We have that loophole built into our public policy,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: In the wake of a mass shooting in a neighboring state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who chairs the National Governors Association, said the idea of raising the minimum age for purchasing semi-automatic rifles should be up for discussion. “I think you’ve got to be able to talk about the AR-15 style weapons and whether that’s an 18 or 21 age,” Hutchinson told CNN this week. “You have to at least have a conversation about that.” But Hutchinson, who leaves office in January, isn’t pushing for the limit in his own state. Any proposed gun restrictions are unlikely to find support among Republicans who control the Legislature. Arkansas Republicans are echoing their party’s calls at the national level to focus instead on beefing up school security or addressing mental health. “If we move to 21, and the shooter is 21, then they’ll want to move to 25,” said Republican state Sen. Bart Hester, who will serve as Senate president next year. “We have established that 18 in our society is an adult who can make adult decisions, and I’m good with that.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: More than half of substantiated child abuse reports in recent years were not in the state’s database, which could result in child abusers being allowed to care for children, state auditors said Tuesday. The unreliability of the database “puts children at risk,” auditors said. The database is used by state and county social services and welfare departments, adoption agencies, medical workers treating possible victims of child abuse, agencies conducting background investigations of applicants for law enforcement jobs, and agencies conducting background investigations on those who want to work or volunteer in positions that would give them access to children, like day care centers or group homes. But the flaws in the database mean those agencies “cannot depend on the database to help protect children,” acting California State Auditor Michael Tilden said in an opening letter to the governor and legislative leaders. The state’s Child Abuse Central Index, run by the state Department of Justice, contains more than 25,000 reports of sexual and physical abuse and neglect that are backed by county records. But there are more than 52,000 such reports in county records, meaning nearly 27,000 reports – 52% – are in county records but not the state’s database, auditors said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Denver-based federal appeals court has agreed with a lower court’s dismissal of a lawsuit that claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from then-President Donald Trump and had been rigged by Dominion Voting Systems, Facebook (now Meta) and others. Friday’s opinion from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, first reported by Colorado Politics, found that eight plaintiffs from across the U.S. had no standing to assert that the outcome of the election “violated the constitutional rights of every registered voter in the United States.” The lawsuit relied on baseless conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen in favor of Joe Biden. Among others, it named Facebook and Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose election machines remain the focus of some of the most fevered – and continuing – unfounded speculation about voting fraud. U.S. Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter dismissed the lawsuit in April 2021, finding the plaintiffs failed to show they had suffered specific injuries due to the election result and thus had no standing to bring the lawsuit. The appeals court agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs’ request to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all registered U.S. voters.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Jury selection began Tuesday for the trial of a state senator and his 2018 campaign treasurer on federal fraud charges alleging they lied in efforts to obtain nearly $180,000 in public funds for his election bid. Bridgeport Democratic Sen. Dennis Bradley and Jessica Martinez, his 2018 campaign treasurer, began picking jurors in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, where their trial could begin as soon as Wednesday. Both deny the allegations and have pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors allege Bradley and Martinez improperly received about $84,000 from the Connecticut Citizens’ Election Program for the 2018 Democratic primary for the Senate seat, then improperly sought to obtain another $95,700 for the general election that year. Authorities say in court documents that Bradley and Martinez made “material misrepresentations and omissions to hide prohibited campaign activities” that would have barred them from receiving the public campaign funds. Among the allegations against Bradley, prosecutors say he used about $5,600 in personal funds to pay for a campaign launch party at a Bridgeport restaurant in March 2018 where he announced his candidacy and collected donations. Bradley knew his personal spending was limited to $2,000, prosecutors said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Mayor Mike Purzycki is proposing the city take ownership of the historic Gibraltar mansion and Marian Coffin gardens, nixing a plan to turn the mansion into a boutique hotel and wedding venue but maintaining developers’ plans to build housing on adjacent land. “As there are too many hard feelings over the way Gibraltar has deteriorated to allow the current owners to be part of any ownership plan, I propose that the city or a city subdivision acquire the entire property and take responsibility for care and maintenance of the mansion and grounds,” the mayor wrote to neighbors last week. Gibraltar Preservation Group – a limited liability company of which Drake Cattermole and David Carpenter are principals – has owned the 6-acre property since 2010. The two spent the following years amassing adjacent parcels to propose a financially viable rehabilitation project for the historic property. During that time, the mansion sat vacant and deteriorated. Local developer Robert Snowberger, of 9SDC – a Wilmington-based historic preservation contractor – introduced plans in February to turn the Gibraltar mansion into a boutique hotel, renovate the greenhouse and garage into restaurant and retail space, and build townhomes on vacant land surrounding the property. But that plan was met with community backlash.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Community groups came together Tuesday to launch the DC Peace Academy, aimed at training and supporting violence interrupters, WUSA-TV reports. The goal is to harness the expertise of organizers who have been fighting gun violence on their own for years and to give them the resources they’ve been lacking. “This gives us an opportunity to be able to center the voices of the people that are closest to this problem,” said Lashonia Thompson-El, executive director of Peace for DC, which is privately funding the program as it brings together multiple organizations into one academy. The 13-week, 125-hour training program educates activists on conflict-resolution and mediation techniques while offering them mental health support. “It’s a job. It’s a skill set. So we want to make sure you know how to do a proper mediation; you know how to engage an 11-year-old that has a gun, as opposed to a 20-year-old who may have a gun,” said Warees Majeed, who helped develop the curriculum. “We want to make sure that you know where the resources are in your community so that you can help better serve them and their family.”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: U.S. wildlife officials have agreed to revise the critical habitat designation for Florida manatees, which have been dying in record numbers because water pollution is killing a main food source. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a court settlement made public Wednesday that it will publish a proposed revision by Sept. 12, 2024. The agreement comes in a long-running court case involving the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and the Save the Manatee Club. The rule would bring enhanced federal scrutiny to projects that might affect the manatee in waterways in which the marine mammals are known to concentrate. One such area is the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s east coast, where this winter officials successfully fed manatees tons of lettuce in an unprecedented experiment to prevent more starvation. Last year, more than 1,100 manatees died largely from lack of food, a state record. This year, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reports 562 manatee deaths as of late May. Dozens more have been rescued and are being cared for at facilities around the country. The manatee critical habitat designation has not been updated since 1976, but advocates have been pushing for a change since 2008. The state wildlife commission estimates there are about 7,500 manatees in the wild in Florida.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: Facing state demands to move forward, as well as public pressure after students produced a viral video showing widespread disrepair, a suburban Atlanta school board on Tuesday voted for a $50 million overhaul at an aging high school after previously voting three times against it. The DeKalb County school board voted unanimously to renovate Druid Hills High School, news outlets report. “I am proud to say today that we’re in unison, that we want what’s good for this district,” board Chair Vickie Turner said, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It feels quite refreshing that we’ve made this progress.” The dispute over Druid Hills climaxed after students made a video about poor conditions including raw sewage, crumbling bathrooms and signs warning of possible electrical shock around utilities in one room. But last month the board rejected plans to overhaul the high school, instead voting to make minor repairs at all the district’s schools. Students from at least two other DeKalb high schools have since published similar videos. The dispute dredged up racial and class tensions that often divide the 93,000-student district between a wealthier white minority in its northern end and a poorer, Black majority in the southern end.\n\nHawaii\n\nPahoa: Police and federal authorities are investigating after a man building homemade fireworks died following an explosion at his house. Police on the Big Island said Tuesday that the man was severely injured by an explosion early Saturday at his home in the Puna district. The man was flown to a Honolulu hospital, where he died, police said. When police arrived at the home, the 35-year-old man was lying on the floor with a wound to his abdomen area. His wife and children were asleep but woke up because of the explosion shortly after 2 a.m. The man had been making homemade fireworks at the time, police said. Police found materials used to make fireworks, several guns and 214 marijuana plants. The exact cause of the explosion is under investigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nRigby: A 12-year-old girl who shot three people at an eastern Idaho junior high last year will likely remain in juvenile detention until her 19th birthday, according to newly released court documents. The girl was charged with three counts of attempted murder after she shot two students and a custodian at Rigby Middle School on May 6, 2021, EastIdahoNews.com reports. All three victims have recovered from their gunshot wounds. Though the school shooting was widely reported, the details about the subsequent charges and outcome of the case remained sealed for months. EastIdahoNews.com filed a public records lawsuit seeking access to the investigative documents, and in April a judge ordered that they be released. Last week, Magistrate Judge Stephen J. Clark ordered the release of some of the court documents as well, noting that the shooting was an “exceptional event.” “To state the obvious, the public has a right to access information concerning an exceptional event,” Clark wrote. The court documents show that the girl pleaded guilty to all three charges as part of an agreement with prosecutors. She was committed to the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections until her 19th birthday or until the Custody Review Board deems her rehabilitated. She could be held by the juvenile corrections department until she turns 21.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A necropsy on a beloved, endangered shorebird named Monty the Piping Plover shows he died of a respiratory infection, experts said Tuesday. The Lincoln Park Zoo said it partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the University of Illinois Zoological Pathology Program to determine the bird’s cause of death. The severe fungal respiratory infection included a laryngitis that restricted Monty’s airway, the zoo announced. Additional testing is being conducted to identify the fungus, but it is suspected of being environmental in origin, the zoo said. Further testing concluded Monty did not show any signs of high pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu, that has been spreading in several states, the zoo said. Monty died May 13 at Chicago’s Montrose beach. His remains will be provided to the Field Museum’s avian department to be available for future studies that contribute to the recovery of the Great Lake piping plovers, the zoo said.\n\nIndiana\n\nSalem: A young boy found dead inside a suitcase in a heavily wooded area of southern Indiana was laid to rest Wednesday following a memorial service in which a police chaplain called the unidentified child an “unknown angel.” Mourners gathered at the Weathers Funeral Home in Salem for Wednesday morning’s service. The child’s gray casket was topped by a floral arrangement and stuffed animals. Todd Murphy, the chaplain for the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, said donations from local residents and businesses paid for the funeral. The child remains unidentified more than a month and a half after his body was discovered by a mushroom hunter in Washington County. “We’re not here today to answer these questions, even if we could. We’re here to mourn,” Murphy told mourners who filled a room for the service. “This unknown angel has been adopted and beloved by the Washington County community, so Angel is what we will call him for the service today.” The boy was later buried at a cemetery with a gravestone marker bearing the image of an angel and an inscription that reads: “In loving memory of a beloved little boy known but to God.” Investigators believe the child, who was Black, was about 5 years old and had died within the previous week.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Residents could face rolling blackouts this summer if extreme heat and spiking demand coincide with insufficient power. A warning by the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a Georgia-based regulatory authority called NERC, prompted state regulators Tuesday to grill utilities on how they would handle controlled outages. Iowa and 14 other states are at high risk of “energy emergencies during peak summer conditions,” NERC said. In April, Midcontinent Independent System Operator told utilities whose power grid it serves, including most of those in Iowa, that it expects summer demand to increase 1.7% over last summer, while generation capacity has declined by 2.3%. MISO said the decline in generation is due to fossil-fueled power plant retirements as the nation shifts to renewable energy. The grid operator expects summer demand to reach 124 gigawatts, though there will be only 119 gigawatts of available energy. It warned that Iowa’s largest utilities, MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy, as well as dozens of municipal and rural electric cooperatives, may be asked to cut power to customers if demand appears on track to exceed available electricity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting above-average temperature for Iowa through August.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Presumed Republican gubernatorial nominee Derek Schmidt on Wednesday announced he’s chosen a staffer for one of Kansas’ two U.S. senators as his running mate in his bid to unseat Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Schmidt filed the necessary paperwork to get him and Katie Sawyer on the ballot for the Aug. 2 primary, where he faces no major opposition. The 38-year-old Sawyer is state director for U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall and worked on Marshall’s congressional staff before his election to the Senate in 2020. Schmidt told reporters he expects Sawyer to be a key adviser if he’s elected, helping him stay informed of people’s views on issues. Kansas lieutenant governors have little formal role in state government other than duties assigned to them by governors, such as Lt. Gov. David Toland serving as state commerce secretary. But over the past 20 years, two of the state’s five governors have left office early, elevating their lieutenant governors to the top position. Before working for Marshall, Sawyer worked in marketing and business development at McPherson College in her hometown, as managing editor of the McPherson Sentinel and as a reporter at The Pittsburg Morning Sun. She and her husband operate a farm.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: A Confederate statue that stood outside a western Kentucky courthouse for more than a century was removed by county workers with little fanfare. The Soldiers Monument at the Daviess County Courthouse was taken down Tuesday morning and moved to the road department, the county’s top official, Judge-Executive Al Mattingly, told the Messenger-Inquirer. He said it will be kept there while officials decide what to do with it. Mattingly said the statue of a soldier with a gun could be placed elsewhere in the county or sold. The base, reading “To Our Confederate Heroes,” remains in place for now. Daviess County officials voted to remove the statue in 2020, but a lawsuit over its ownership delayed any action. Daviess Circuit Judge Lisa Payne Jones ruled last month that the statue belonged to the county, the newspaper reports. The Rev. Rhondalyn Randolph, president of the Owensboro NAACP, led the charge for removal and said she’s thankful the statue that stood on the courthouse lawn since 1900 is gone. Randolph said her aim was never to erase history but “to promote truth for how things actually happened without romanticizing the antebellum period.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has vetoed legislation that supporters said would open up loan opportunities for people who need credit but that opponents said enabled predatory lending. The Advocate reports that the bill by state Sen. Rick Ward, R-Port Allen, would have allowed so-called payday lenders to offer installment loans worth up to $1,500, with fees and interest totaling 100% of the amount loaned. In his Tuesday veto message, the Democratic governor noted the arguments that Ward’s bill would have aided people who need loans and have a difficult time getting them from banks. “However, and despite the best efforts of the bill’s author, I do not believe that this bill adequately protects the public from predatory lending practices,” Edwards wrote in his veto message. Payday lenders typically make short-term, high-interest loans to be paid back from the borrower’s next paycheck. Payday loans are currently capped at $350 in Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nOld Orchard Beach: Wildlife advocates predict this summer will bring another record-high number of a rare species of bird to the state’s beaches. The piping plover nests in Maine and is listed as threatened along the East Coast by federal authorities. Recent signs, however, are encouraging. Just 10 pairs of the birds were found in Maine in 1981, the first year of monitoring. Last year’s total swelled to 125. Laura Minich Zitske, coastal bird program director for Maine Audubon, told the Portland Press Herald that this year looks likely to yield another record high. There are a couple thousand piping plover pair nests from North Carolina to eastern Canada. They are small shorebirds that are vulnerable to predation from numerous animals, including larger wild birds and feral cats.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Peter Wolf Toth, a world-traveling, self-taught sculptor, has returned to the resort town to repair his 20-foot tall Whispering Giant sculpture. Toth, who was initially invited to erect the sculpture in 1976 by former Mayor Harry W. Kelley, said he was pleased to have an excuse to return to Ocean City. Born in Vienna, Austria, Toth moved to the United States at age 11 and began to develop a deep interest in Native American art, culture and history. Although he is a self-taught sculptor, he was often inspired by his father, also an artist. Toth’s first statue was made from stone and on a California cliffside. Since then, he has built a total of 74 statues, at least one in each of the 50 states. He has teased that his next project will be along the Amazon River. Through his work, Toth aims to raise a nation’s conscience to the plight of Indigenous peoples across the globe. His art, primarily abstract expressionism, encompasses the North American continent and beyond. The statue standing in Ocean City, titled Nanticoke, is composed of three materials: oak, steel and concrete. “I believe that wood brings out the living quality of a human being,” said Toth, 74. When he’s not sculpting, passersby will find him playing chess. He invited the public to sit down with him for a friendly game or stop and chat about his work.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A memorial to a famed Civil War unit made up of Black soldiers was rededicated Wednesday after a three-year-long restoration with a ceremony filled with song and somber reflection. The Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial – considered the nation’s first honoring Black soldiers – underscores how ending slavery was not just about one man but many, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi said in his remarks. “The Black soldiers of the 54th were as much the great emancipators as Abraham Lincoln,” the author of “How to Be an Antiracist” and founder of Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research said. “The 54th are a testament to ‘We freed us.’ There wasn’t a single person that abolished slavery. It was something we did together.” Dr. David Blight, a Yale history professor, said the memorial is considered the country’s greatest work of public art not just because of its beauty but also because of the message it tells. He pointed to the memorial’s Latin inscription, which he said is translated: “He gave up everything to serve the Republic.” The towering bronze relief by American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens captures the stirring call to arms answered by Black soldiers who served in the unit, which was popularized in the 1989 Oscar-winning movie “Glory.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Supreme Court declared Juneteenth a statewide court holiday Wednesday over the objections of two Republican justices who said taxpayers will be shortchanged. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. It was about 21/ 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Southern states. Congress and President Joe Biden created a federal holiday a year ago. “Juneteenth is an event of profound importance in the history of our nation, and mandatory observance of this holiday by courts statewide sends a message that Michigan’s judiciary values the life experiences of all who seek justice,” said Tom Boyd, state court administrator. Juneteenth will be the 13th paid holiday when Michigan courts are closed. This year it will be observed on June 20, a Monday. “This is far more than observed by the private sector,” Justice Brian Zahra said. “I believe as servants of the people we owe it to them to work diligently and regularly to provide good public service.” Justice David Viviano said courts slogging through a COVID-19 backlog of cases will face another burden.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBuffalo: A man accused in a shooting attack on a medical clinic that killed one staff member and wounded four others last year refused to look at the survivors Tuesday as they described their pain and terror. Gregory Ulrich is being tried on charges of murder, attempted murder and other counts in the Feb. 9, 2021, shooting at the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, a small city about 40 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Ulrich sat attentively at the table with his lawyers through the first two weeks of trial. This time he laid his head on a courtroom table and wrapped his arms around it as victims took the stand. He didn’t look up through two hours of testimony, the Star Tribune reports. Before the jury was brought in, Ulrich told Wright County District Judge Catherine McPherson that he was in great pain and would prefer to lie down outside the courtroom. “Pain is the most powerful drug. I might as well be on heroin. I’m all mixed up, and I need some pain medication so I can talk and think about it,” Ulrich said. But McPherson ordered him to remain in the courtroom. Prosecutors say Ulrich was angry about his medical treatment at the clinic. Court records allege he has mental health and substance abuse problems. After the two victims testified, prosecutors played two short videos made by Ulrich in December 2020, about six weeks before the attack. “They’re gonna find out what happens” when they mess with “a good Christian man,” he said in one of the videos. “You picked on the wrong person.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove is teaming up with a health care executive to apply for a state license to open a medical marijuana testing facility. The Mississippi State Department of Health started taking applications Wednesday for the state’s new medical marijuana program for patients, medical practitioners, growers, processors, testers, and transportation and waste disposal providers. Musgrove and Quentin Whitwell, who are both attorneys, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that they are applying for a license to open Magnolia Tech Labs in Marshall County. “To me, medical marijuana is … a natural progression of options for health care in Mississippi and in America,” Musgrove said. “I mean, to me, it’s obvious that it will eventually be offered in all 50 states.” A wide majority of Mississippi voters approved a medical marijuana ballot initiative in November 2020, but the state Supreme Court invalidated the results of that election six months later by ruling the initiative was not properly on the ballot. Earlier this year, Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to create a medical marijuana program. Whitwell is involved at high levels with three rural hospitals in north Mississippi. Musgrove is a Democrat who was governor from 2000 to 2004 after serving one term as lieutenant governor. For nine years, he was chairman of the national Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. Whitwell, who now lives in Oxford, served as a Republican on the Jackson City Council from 2011 to 2014.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans’ Hospital plans to celebrate its 50th anniversary Thursday with a time capsule event. The capsule commemorates the anniversary as well as the work that has been done and is continuing to be done since the opening of the medical center in 1972, the hospital announced. “The event is meant to celebrate 50 years of outstanding care that Truman VA staff have provided to our nation’s heroes,” the hospital said. The celebration is scheduled to kick off at 10 a.m. Thursday. The center is inviting staff, veterans and their families, and other stakeholders, including congressional staff, former employees and veteran service organizations. The center’s vision centers on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ core values, including integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect and excellence – “to provide veterans the world-class benefits and services they have earned, and to do so by adhering to the highest standards,” the department’s website says.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city is suing the First United Methodist Church to enforce its zoning requirements on campgrounds, a city press release said Tuesday. Unhoused people have taken refuge at the church, stirring fiery debate for months, with some residents wanting the city to do more to provide for the homeless and others framing it as a problem that taxpayers should not be responsible for solving. Pastor Jeff Wakeley said the church had not been served the lawsuit papers and therefore did not have comment on the matter. The church is zoned in the city’s C-4 central business core. That permits emergency shelter with a conditional use permit, which the church has submitted and is being processed by city staff, according to the release. The application will be presented to the Great Falls Zoning Commission within the next few weeks. The C-4 district does not permit campgrounds, which is the basis of the city’s suit in District Court. According to the release, the church was placed on notice regarding the tent and camper encampment violation, and the city said the church did not respond to that notice by removing the tents and camping arrangements as directed. There have been several public nuisance complaints related to the unhoused living on the church’s property.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A federal judge threw out a lawsuit against prosecutors filed by the family of a white bar owner who killed himself after being charged in the fatal shooting of a Black man during 2020 protests over racial injustice. U.S. District Judge John Gerrard said in an order Tuesday that there is no legal basis to conclude Douglas County prosecutors are liable for the death of 38-year-old Jake Gardner. His parents accused the Douglas County Attorney’s Office, its top prosecutor and a special prosecutor of violating Gardner’s constitutional rights. The lawsuit also accused special prosecutor Fred Franklin of implying during a news conference that Gardner was a racist, leading Gardner to take his own life Sept. 20, 2020, in Oregon. Gardner was charged with manslaughter and other felonies in the May 30, 2020, shooting death of 22-year-old James Scurlock outside Gardner’s downtown Omaha bar during protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine initially declined to charge Gardner, saying he acted in self-defense after being attacked by Scurlock. Kleine later asked for a grand jury investigation after critics said he hadn’t thoroughly investigated the shooting. Franklin later said additional evidence from Gardner’s phone and his Facebook Messenger account, along with video from inside his bar, shed new light on his intent. Following Gardner’s death, Franklin revealed Gardner had been armed and waiting to ambush people who might break into businesses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Chapels of love that use Elvis Presley’s likeness could find themselves becoming Heartbreak Hotels. The licensing company that controls the name and image of “The King” is ordering Sin City chapel operators to stop using Elvis in themed ceremonies, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Authentic Brands Group sent cease-and-desist letters in early May to multiple chapels, which are expected to be compliant by now. With Elvis so closely tied to Vegas’ wedding industry, some say the move could decimate their businesses. “We are a family-run business, and now we’re hanging with the big dogs,” said Kayla Collins, who operates LasVegasElvisWeddingChapel.com and the Little Chapel of Hearts with her husband. “That’s our bread and butter. I don’t get it. We were just hitting our stride again through COVID, then this happens.” Clark County Clerk Lynn Goya, who led a marketing campaign promoting Las Vegas as a wedding destination, said the order for chapels to stop using Elvis couldn’t have come at a worse time for the sector. The city’s wedding industry generates $2 billion a year, and officials say Elvis-themed weddings represent a significant number of the ceremonies performed. “It might destroy a portion of our wedding industry. A number of people might lose their livelihood,” Goya said. One chapel last weekend had its Elvis impersonator change instead into a leather jacket, jeans and a fedora for a “rock ’n’ roll” themed ceremony, the Review-Journal reports.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Supreme Court adopted a congressional redistricting plan Tuesday, one day before the filing period opened for candidates in the upcoming elections. New Hampshire is one of the last states to adopt a plan as required every 10 years to reflect population changes, although maps in several other states still are being challenged in court. In the end, the new map doesn’t differ drastically from the old. It moves just five towns – Albany, Campton, Jackson, New Hampton and Sandwich – from the 1st District to the 2nd. The court took action after Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed two maps approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature that would have given the GOP an advantage in the 1st District. “It is now undisputed that a demonstrated impasse has occurred,” the court said in its unanimous order. Under both the old and new maps, the 1st District covers the eastern part of the state and some of the south, including Manchester. The 2nd District covers the western, northern and some southern communities, including Nashua. Though Democrats hold both seats, the 1st District seat flipped five times in seven election cycles before Democrat Chris Pappas won his first term in 2018.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Hundreds of casino workers picketed outside the Tropicana on Wednesday, as the union for employees at nine casinos is pushing for a new contract giving them a share of gambling halls’ post-COVID recovery. The picketing comes at an uncertain time in Atlantic City: The casinos and their online partners are collectively making more money now than before the pandemic hit. But the casinos say those statistics are misleading because they get to keep only about 30% of online and sports betting money, with the rest going to their third-party partners. They say that in-person revenue won from gamblers is the crucial metric, and not all the casinos have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels. The old contract between the casinos and Local 54 of the Unite Here union expired early Wednesday. Union leaders and workers said they will demonstrate as often as necessary to show the casinos they’re serious about their demand that workers are able to make up ground as the casinos are trying to do so. “We are united, we are ready to fight, and we have very specific asks in a new contract, number one of which is a raise that matters,” said union President Bob McDevitt. “Our hope is the individual casinos will recognize that these are really big numbers that they are racking up and that the workers have not had a cost-of-living raise in a while.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office tapped into a taxpayer-funded expense account to pay for a political event at the governor’s mansion in October, prompting her reelection campaign to quietly reimburse the state two months later. Documents obtained under a public records request show New Mexicans for Michelle, the governor’s campaign committee, issued the state a $1,837 check in December to pay for expenses stemming from a Democratic Governors Association party hosted by Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe. At the time, Lujan Grisham was serving as chairwoman of the association, a Washington, D.C.-based political organization dedicated to electing Democratic governors and other candidates. The reimbursement appeared in the governor’s campaign finance reports as a “campaign event.” “The campaign transparently and expeditiously reimbursed the state for an event hosted by the Governor as chair of the Democratic Governors Association,” campaign spokeswoman Kendall Witmer said in a statement Wednesday. Witmer did not provide any other comment or information about the event, and the Democratic Governors Association did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A woman who was among those injured in a shooting attack on the New York City subway last month filed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Glock and its parent company Tuesday, accusing the firearm maker of “reckless disregard for human life.” In her lawsuit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, Ilene Steur said Glock has “endangered the public health and safety” with its marketing, distribution and sales of its guns, one of which was used in the attack. An email seeking comment was sent to Glock. Steur was one of 10 people wounded April 12 when a gunman fired dozens of bullets in a train full of morning commuters. The man charged in the attack, Frank James, has pleaded not guilty to terrorism and other counts. In the lawsuit, Glock is accused of “marketing that emphasizes firearm characteristics such as their high capacity and ease of concealment, that appeal to prospective purchasers with criminal intent.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation authorizing marijuana for medical use and developing a system to grow, sell and regulate cannabis was recommended by a state Senate committee Wednesday, nine months after it last surfaced. The measure, which now heads to the Senate floor for the first of two required votes Thursday, would allow patients with at least one of the more than a dozen “debilitating medical conditions” to purchase and use marijuana with their physician’s formal approval. Those conditions would include cancer, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder. The bill envisions several dozen medical cannabis centers across the state operated by 10 state-licensed growers and vendors. They could sell up to 30-day supplies of pot or cannabis-infused products to patients or their caregivers, who would have to obtain registration cards from the state Department of Health and Human Services. Ten percent of the cannabis suppliers’ monthly revenues would be forwarded to the state. The legislation had been idled in the Senate since last August after advancing through three policy committees. Brunswick County Republican Sen. Bill Rabon, chief bill sponsor and a cancer survivor, said the measure was never on a fast track, adding that he wanted to ensure all of his colleagues’ questions were answered to build bipartisan support.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Police have arrested a woman for allegedly trespassing on the state Capitol grounds near the governor’s residence. The Bismarck Tribune reports the 32-year-old was taken into custody Sunday night. According to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, the woman was seen near the residence about 9:45 p.m. but left when police asked her to leave. Capitol security spotted her near the residence again about half an hour later. She had entered the grounds when a gate opened to let a vehicle pass. North Dakota Highway Patrol Sgt. Jenna Clawson Huibregste said the woman said she wanted to speak with the governor and give him paperwork about what what the spokeswoman termed “a personal matter.” She didn’t elaborate. She said the woman was under the influence and combative, and it took multiple officers to subdue her. Gov. Doug Burgum and first lady Kathryn Burgum were home at the time, but the woman didn’t enter the residence.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legalized sports betting in the state will officially begin Jan. 1, the state Casino Control Commission announced Wednesday. A bill signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine in December set Jan. 1 as a deadline, but some groups pushed for starting earlier to allow for betting on football during the fall. The commission had previously predicted it would take months to formulate rules and regulations. The legislation will allow people to place sports bets online, at casinos and racinos, and at stand-alone betting kiosks in bars, restaurants and professional sports facilities. People will be able to place wagers on professional sports teams, motor sports, Olympic events, golf and tennis, and major college sports such as football and basketball. Ohio joins more than 30 states that have passed legislation since a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on states legalizing sports wagering. Operators will pay a 10% tax on net revenue to help fund K-12 education and problem-gambling programs. The state Legislative Service Commission estimates that sports betting will eventually become a $3.35 billion industry in Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: President Joe Biden on Wednesday recalled “the hell that was unleashed” 101 years ago when a white mob looted and burned a section of the city known as Black Wall Street, killing hundreds of people. “We remember the hell that was unleashed,” said a statement from Biden, who traveled to Tulsa one year ago to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. “This was not a riot; it was a massacre.” The violence was, for decades afterward, referred to as the Tulsa Race Riot and was largely ignored. An estimated 300 Black people were killed May 31 and June 1, 1921, in the attack on then-prosperous Greenwood District. A search for the graves of massacre victims began last year, with nearly three dozen coffins containing remains of possible victims recovered and researchers urging that the search continue. Biden said his administration has worked to end housing discrimination for Black people and to provide federal contracts to businesses owned by Black and brown people. A lawsuit that includes three known survivors of the massacre and seeks reparations for the violence and financial losses of life, homes and businesses is pending in Tulsa County District Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Every public school district in the state last year was given the option to ban guns from their properties, but most have declined to do so, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Since a change to Oregon law in September, only 13% of the state’s public school districts have opted to close an exemption that allows holders of a concealed handgun license to carry weapons onto public property where possessing a gun would otherwise be a felony. According to an analysis by OPB, that list includes some districts in the Portland metro area – though not yet Portland Public Schools – along with more rural school systems. Among the 25 that have banned guns are districts in Klamath Falls, Myrtle Point, Tillamook, Pendleton, Tigard-Tualatin, Lake Oswego and Woodburn. The vast majority of the state’s 197 public school districts have, to date, taken no action. Whether to prohibit guns in schools has been a contentious point in Oregon, where one estimate suggests gun ownership is more prevalent than in many other states. After the slaying of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, independent Oregon gubernatorial candidate Betsy Johnson faced heated questions about her pro-gun stance from a crowd in Portland.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A suburban Philadelphia man charged in the January 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol after he was turned in by an ex-girlfriend after reportedly insulting her intelligence for not believing the election had been stolen has pleaded guilty to a felony count. Richard Michetti, 29, of Ridley Park, pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in Washington to a charge of aiding and abetting obstruction of an official proceeding. He was originally also charged with trespassing, violent entry and disorderly conduct. FBI authorities said a former romantic partner of Michetti alerted authorities about his presence a day after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Officials said photos showed him inside the Capitol Rotunda. The affidavit alleged that Michetti said he was there to protest the election results and told the informant in a text message several hours after the siege began: “If you can’t see the election was stolen you’re a moron.” The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Michetti said little during Tuesday’s hearing. He is to be sentenced Sept. 1, and although the charge carries a maximum 20-year sentence, federal sentencing guidelines call for call for a prison term of 15 to 21 months, the paper reports.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: High school students walked out of school Wednesday and rallied at City Hall to protest inaction in Congress and at many state capitols on gun control. Organizer Zachary Pinto, 17, said his fellow students told him they were frustrated, angry and in pain after last week’s shooting at a Uvalde, Texas, grade school. That spurred him to lead students out of the Charles E. Shea High School in Pawtucket when the bell rang for lunch Wednesday. They were joined by other local high school students. The group of more than 150 students converged at Pawtucket City Hall. Pinto, a junior, said they feel like politicians nationwide “would rather protect guns than children.” He led a chant to call out the names of the 21 victims of the Uvalde school shooting. Democrats in Congress have been trying to expand background checks and otherwise boost gun control laws since a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Pinto, who supports the proposed bans, said schools like Shea High School need more counselors to help address a wide range of mental health issues, rather than a greater police presence. The students also want local officials to address a “severe lack of resources” and the need for repairs at Shea, Pinto added. “I want them to just care,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Regular early voting began across the state for the first time Tuesday. Legislators passed and the governor signed into law a bill allowing anyone to cast a ballot without an excuse for the two weeks before Election Day in the same way they would by going to the polls. South Carolina’s primaries are June 14, and early voting is available Mondays through Fridays. The procedure to vote is just the same as on election day. For the general election in November, early voting centers will also be open on Saturdays. Counties are required to have at least one polling place open. Some smaller counties like Bamberg, Chester, Hampton and Williamsburg counties will have multiple locations, while some larger counties like Aiken, Charleston, Greenville, Lexington and York only have one site at the county election office. A list of sites is on the South Carolina Election Commission’s website. County officials said early voting does give them flexibility to get more workers or voting machines to a site if it gets busy, which is something impossible to do on election day. Absentee voting is still allowed for people over the age of 65, with mobility issues or illnesses, but those ballots must be cast by mail.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A judge has delayed the release of affidavits in the child pornography investigation of banker and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, days after the South Dakota attorney general’s office declined to file charges. Minnehaha County Judge James Power said in an email Tuesday that the affidavits would remain sealed until parties in the case seeking to unseal them have a chance to submit written briefs. Affidavits are submitted by law enforcement officers when they ask judges to issue search warrants. Sanford attorney Stacy Hegge asked Power in an email Monday to keep the affidavits sealed or at least be given additional time in order to seek relief from the South Dakota Supreme Court. The delay comes after the attorney general’s office said in a Friday filing that the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation has determined there are “no prosecutable offenses” under state law. South Dakota investigators in 2019 began searching Sanford’s email account, as well as his cellular and internet service providers, for possible possession of child pornography after his accounts were flagged by a technology firm.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will celebrate National Trails Day by offering free guided hikes at all 56 state parks starting this weekend. According to a news release, the events come as Tennessee’s state parks agency will celebrate its 85th anniversary. “We’re looking forward to the hikes at each of our parks especially this year because of the anniversaries of our parks and National Trails Day,” Jim Bryson, deputy commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, said in a statement. “Each hike has its own identity, and we invite everyone to participate.” Radnor Lake State Park, located within Nashville, will hold a kickoff night hike Friday. Following events will include day hikes, history hikes, nature hikes and trail cleanup hikes. Some will host post-hike celebrations. A full schedule can be found online.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A week after the state’s deadliest school shooting, several dozen teacher union officials, parents and other education advocates marched Tuesday to the downtown Austin office of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, demanding he support “sensible gun regulation.” Attendees walked from the Texas AFL-CIO building to the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, where Cruz’s Central Texas office is located, screaming chants such as “Hey hey, ho ho, these dangerous guns have got to go.” People also held signs that read “Books not guns” and “Protect our students.” The Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers called Cruz’s response to the shooting “abominable,” saying in a statement that the junior Texas senator has been “beating a drum promoting the status quo.” Ken Zarifis, president of Education Austin, the Austin school district’s employee union, said arming teachers is not the answer. Instead, he and other attendees expressed support for universal background checks, a total ban on assault rifles and red flag laws, which would temporarily remove guns from people who pose a risk to themselves or others. “There are things that can be done ... that have been proven nationally,” said Zarifis, who attended the march. “Red (flag) laws that have been enacted by far-right Republican legislators. They should be enacted here in Texas.”\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Two local groups, St. George Races and the St. George Firefighters Association, are joining forces to offer a new way to beat the summer heat, holding the Moonlight 5K on June 10 at 9 p.m. in the Desert Color community. Throughout the course, firefighters will spray runners with water. After the race, registered participants can take part in a glow-in-the-dark pool party from 10 p.m. to midnight. Typically, the newly built lagoon is restricted to residents of Desert Color. “When we started this race seven years ago, we had no idea it would continue to grow into one of the most enjoyable races and family activities of the summer,” said Jake Green, a St. George firefighter. “The firefighters love it, our families love it, and the community loves it. With it taking place during the annual Utah State Firefighters’ Association Convention, we are looking forward to even more participants.” Participants may register online. A portion of the proceeds from the event will benefit the Utah Burn Center and the St. George Firefighters Association. “After the race, stick around and enjoy an awesome pool party,” Green said. “We can’t wait to see everyone come out and have a blast, get sprayed by the fire hoses, and be involved in our great City of St. George.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: An app created by a Vermonter will soon serve as a platform for queer friendship in communities nationwide. Anna Harissis, co-founder of the Out App, grew up in Stowe, went to college in Boston and moved around several times, including a stint in Burlington, before landing in Denver. She and other co-founder Jen Farmer, both lesbians, wanted to find queer friends to hang out with in their new home but ran into some barriers. “When we first moved here, it was kind of hard to find queer community,” Harissis said. “We really only have dating apps to find each other.” The dating apps – even versions made for finding platonic friends, like Bumble BFF – were not tailored for finding LGBTQ friends. Harissis saw a need for something more specialized, so she got to work. Out App will launch sometime this month, which is Pride Month, and have three different features to help queer people connect. A “Friend Finder” will let people make profiles and swipe to match with potentially compatible friends. Another section will publicize queer-friendly events in the area, and the third will map businesses and places in the community that are queer-friendly. Harissis described the locations section as a “queer Yelp” that can help families and individuals seeking queer-friendly doctors, restrooms, restaurants, hotels and stores.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The divided General Assembly passed a compromise state budget Wednesday that would offer nearly $4 billion in tax relief, increase pay for teachers and other public employees, boost K-12 education spending, and fund a wide range of projects from roadwork to school construction. Budget negotiators crafted the measure at a time when Virginia’s tax revenues have been soaring far beyond projections. That allowed for making long-term investments in core government services while also boosting the state’s reserves and enacting tax cuts that are expected to save a family of four an estimated $1,108 a year, Republican House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight said. “It’s been a long haul, but I believe the result is a fiscally sound, bipartisan budget we can all be proud of,” he said. The proposed spending plan, which covers two fiscal years and would take effect July 1, passed with broad bipartisan support and relatively subdued debate. Lawmakers also passed a bill making adjustments to the current budget. The legislation now goes to GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who can sign it or seek changes. He said in a statement earlier this week that the compromise offered a “good framework” and that he would be reviewing it closely in the days to come.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The Washington State Patrol says drivers are increasingly refusing to stop for troopers, and other law enforcement agencies also say it’s becoming a common occurrence. The Northwest News Network reports that from Jan. 1 to May 17 of this year, the agency logged 934 failure-to-yield incidents. While the patrol didn’t track this in the past, veteran troopers say there’s been a dramatic uptick in drivers fleeing traffic stops. “Something’s changed. People are not stopping right now,” said Sgt. Darren Wright, a WSP spokesperson with 31 years on the job. “It’s happening three to five times a shift on some nights and then a couple times a week on day shift.” Local police departments are also seeing this behavior. The Puyallup Police Department logged 148 instances of drivers fleeing from officers from July 26, 2021, to May 18, 2022. Asked if that represents a significant increase, Chief Scott Engle wrote in an email: “I could 1,000,000% say this is completely absolutely emphatically totally unusual.” In Lakewood, another small city in Pierce County, Chief Mike Zaro said drivers are refusing to stop for his officers on average once a day. “A lot of times they’re stolen cars; sometimes we don’t know what the deal is,” Zaro said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A dashboard with some foster care data collected by the state made its debut Wednesday, more than two months after it was cut by lawmakers from a bill proposal. Advocates have said making the data available to the public could help both policymakers and nonprofit groups interested in assisting children while keeping residents informed. It includes information on Child Protective Service placements by county; types of placements, including homes and placement facilities; workforce information broken down by both district office and county; and out-of-state placements. According to the Department of Health and Human Resources dashboard, which will be updated monthly, there are 6,654 children in the care of the state. One-third of the in-state placements are children living with relatives acting as certified foster parents. Marissa Sanders, who is an adoptive parent and founder of the West Virginia Foster, Adoptive and Kinship Parents Network, has called the need for the dashboard critical. “As a nonprofit, if I want to do a project in a particular county or region, I have to have data to prove that I need to do that project in order to get funding for it,” Sanders said. “I have pastors calling, saying, ‘We’d love to support all of the foster families in our county.’ ”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A circuit court judge ruled Wednesday that it was legal for private grants from a group funded by Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg to be sent to the Democratic stronghold of Madison to help it run the 2020 election during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ruling from Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke affirmed an earlier decision by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission rejecting a complaint challenging the grant money from the Chicago-based Center for Tech and Civic Life as illegal bribery. It is the latest in a series of court rulings, both in Wisconsin and nationally, upholding the legality of the private grant money. The lawsuit challenging that ruling as it pertained to Madison was brought on behalf of five voters by Erick Kaardal, a former secretary and treasurer for the Republican Party of Minnesota, who is an attorney for the conservative Thomas More Society. Kaardal also filed four nearly identical lawsuits challenging the grant money being awarded in four other heavily Democratic cities: Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay. Those cases are all pending. The one targeting the grant money in Madison is the first to have a ruling. President Joe Biden won battleground Wisconsin over Donald Trump by almost 21,000 votes. The victory has been upheld by numerous courts.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A bison gored a 25-year-old woman in Yellowstone National Park and tossed her 10 feet into the air. The bison was walking near a boardwalk at Black Sand Basin, just north of Old Faithful, when the woman approached it Monday, according to a park statement. She got within 10 feet before the animal gored her and threw her high in the air. The woman from Grove City, Ohio, sustained a puncture wound and other injuries. Park emergency medical providers responded and transported her via ambulance to a hospital in Idaho. Park officials say it’s the first reported bison goring this year. The park statement said bison are unpredictable, have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, and can run three times faster than humans. Park regulations require visitors to remain more than 25 yards away from bison. The park statement said two other people were also within 25 yards of the same bison. The incident was under investigation. No additional information was immediately available.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/06/06/sled-dog-reunion-ali-stamp-push-pothole-spat-news-around-states/50334989/", "title": "Sled dog reunion, Ali stamp push: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Mike Durant, the “Black Hawk Down” pilot who finished third in the state’s Republican U.S. Senate primary, said he will not make an endorsement in the upcoming runoff. Durant said he will not back either of the remaining candidates for the GOP nomination for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby. The June 21 runoff pits Katie Britt, Shelby’s former chief of staff and former leader of a state business group, against U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, who resurrected his campaign after losing ex-President Donald Trump’s backing. Durant said the choices are a candidate who has “been in the public office for 40 years” and another he called “really not qualified” and accused of running an ethically challenged campaign that distorted his views. “That’s what people have to decide. Unfortunately, it’s not a great option,” he said. Durant is the owner of an aerospace company but best known as the helicopter pilot who was held captive in Somalia during the 1993 battle chronicled in “Black Hawk Down.” With his military background, Durant entered the race with a splash but ultimately ended in third place. He said his first foray into politics was a disenchanting one and will also be his last. He blamed his campaign’s demise on a bombardment of negative ads he called “blatant” mistruths. “If people say, well, ‘that’s just politics’ – well, then don’t complain about what we have in Washington. That’s not politics. Wrong is wrong,” Durant said.\n\nAlaska\n\nRuby: An Iditarod sled dog was found safe after disappearing from a checkpoint in the race three months ago and covering nearly 150 miles, the Iditarod Trail Committee said Saturday. Musher Sebastien Dos Santos Borges, of France, was picking Leon up and returning with him to France, the trail committee said in a statement. Leon went missing in March after what the trail committee said was his “escape” from the Ruby checkpoint. In May, residents of the Alaska city of McGrath, over 120 miles south of the checkpoint, reported to race director Mark Nordman that they’d seen Leon frequently near a cabin. The resident of the cabin and another musher left food for Leon in the hopes of catching him, according to the trail committee. He was captured early Saturday morning and was safe, alert and “understandably skinny but seemingly healthy,” said Iditarod spokesperson Shannon Markley. Leon was expected to see a veterinarian in the coming days and needs a health certificate before he can fly back to France, Markley said. The nearly 1,000-mile race across Alaska began March 6 just north of Anchorage. The route took mushers along Alaska’s untamed and unforgiving wilderness, including two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and Bering Sea ice along the state’s western coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A lawyer for the Arizona Republican Party and its firebrand leader, Kelli Ward, urged a judge Friday to invalidate the state’s overwhelmingly popular system of mail-in voting, a process used by about 90% of voters. Voting by mail is inconsistent with the Arizona Constitution’s requirement for a secret ballot, attorney Alex Kolodin argued. He urged a Mohave County judge to ban the practice for nearly all voters in the 2022 general election in November – but not for the primary in August, for which ballots are scheduled to be mailed next month. The case is the latest in a multipronged effort by Ward and the state GOP to roll back a system of no-excuse absentee voting that the GOP-controlled Legislature has adopted since 1991. They’ve pushed to require most people to cast a ballot in person on Election Day as ex-President Donald Trump repeats the lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud in Arizona and other battleground states. Only the voters, not the Legislature, can authorize mail voting by amending the constitution, Kolodin argued. Lawyers for state and county election officials as well as the Arizona Democratic Party said the vote-by-mail laws have plenty of secrecy safeguards built in, and nothing in the state constitution prohibits the Legislature from allowing citizens to vote that way.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Local organizations are coming together to celebrate Juneteenth, offering events throughout the holiday weekend. 64.6 Downtown and the Fort Smith Roundtable are partnering to offer the city free live music Thursday, June 16, and Sunday, June 19. Juneteenth occurs on June 19 and celebrates the day in 1865 when Galveston, Texas, slaves learned of their freedom, about 21/ 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. This marks the second year that Juneteenth has been recognized as a federal holiday. “So now that it is a federally recognized holiday we feel it’s important for the city to show a consistent, organized celebration,” said Clifton Culpepper, with the Fort Smith Round Table. The city of Fort Smith, Walmart, the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith and Punkin Pictures also partnered to put on Juneteenth events Friday, June 17, and Saturday, June 18, according to a press release. At 6 p.m. Friday, the organizations will present the Making History Gala at Freedom Farms. The evening will include a cocktail hour and dinner by Chef James Thomas of The Rialto Restaurant. There will also be performances by local and regional musicians. The play “A Raisin in the Sun” will debut at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is spending $11 million on education programs promoting wider use of “red flag” laws that are designed to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed at risk of harming themselves or others, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday. The money was included in the state budget he approved nearly a year ago, but the programs are now getting underway. Newsom announced the funding on National Gun Violence Awareness Day and as he continued promoting California’s gun control efforts as a national model in response to recent mass shootings, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Uvalde, Texas; and Buffalo, New York. California approved its red flag law in 2014 after an earlier mass shooting. It allows police, loved ones and others to ask judges to approve what are formally known as gun violence restraining orders that temporarily bar someone from possessing firearms if they are found to be a risk to themselves or others. Similar intervention programs are in 19 states and the District of Columbia. But a report last year by the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis Health said most people aren’t aware that the orders are an option. The new 18-month outreach program is designed to expand their use.\n\nColorado\n\nLakewood: Investigators say the state’s second-largest wildfire on record was human-caused. The U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the determination was made based on evidence gathered at the origin of the East Troublesome Fire, but it’s still unclear exactly how the blaze started. “Given the location and time of year that the fire started, it may have been caused by a hunter or a backcountry camper, and possibly by accident,” the agency said in a news release, adding that the investigation is ongoing. The fire was reported Oct. 14, 2020, and high winds and drought conditions allowed it to quickly spread through dead and fallen beetle-killed trees. The fire came dangerously close to the town of Estes Park near Rocky Mountain National Park before it was slowed by a late October snowstorm. More than 350 homes were destroyed in the blaze, which scorched more than 300 square miles.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: A federal appeals court has upheld part of a 2020 police accountability law that allows public disclosure of state trooper personnel files and internal investigations. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Thursday rejected a challenge by the Connecticut State Police Union, which argued the law violates the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions to state freedom of information laws. The contract section in question says troopers’ personnel files and documents in internal investigations that end with no finding of wrongdoing are not subject to disclosure. A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a lower court ruling against the union. “Because we conclude that the law the union sought to enjoin was reasonable and necessary to achieve a legitimate public purpose, we identify no error in the District Court’s legal or factual conclusions,” the panel wrote. Proponents of the 2020 law said it answered the calls for reform after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people. It also created a new state inspector general to investigate police use-of-force cases statewide, limited circumstances in which deadly use of force can be justified, and allowed lawsuits in state courts against officers in certain cases.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers on Thursday announced plans to pass major gun reform in the final weeks of the legislative session, including banning the sale of semi-automatic weapons, limiting high-capacity magazines and increasing the purchasing age for most firearms. It comes after a number of mass shootings in America, most notably in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman shot and killed 19 elementary school children and two teachers. Thursday’s announcement showed movement among Delaware Democrats, who in recent years found themselves at a standoff on several gun reform issues. The package of bills, which has the support of Gov. John Carney, also includes strengthening background checks by reinstituting the Firearm Transaction Approval Program; holding gun manufacturers and dealers liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence; and banning the use of devices that convert handguns into fully automatic weapons. The bill to limit high-capacity magazines shows a significant shift among House lawmakers, who had previously received criticism on this issue. Last year, the Senate passed a bill that would have defined and banned “large-capacity magazines” with a capacity to hold more than 17 rounds of ammunition. House lawmakers added an amendment that would allow for the ownership of large-capacity magazines but include a stricter punishment if used in a crime. It also changed the definition of what the bill defined as a “large-capacity magazine.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A U.S. Capitol Police officer was indicted on federal civil rights charges after he was involved in an unauthorized high-speed chase, crashed into a motorcycle and then tried to cover it up, prosecutors said Friday. The officer, Thomas Smith, was supposed to be checking on the homes of members of Congress in Georgetown about 11:30 p.m. June 20, 2020, when he started pursuing two motorcycles. Prosecutors say he “followed closely behind these vehicles at a high rate of speed” before he swerved his marked patrol car into one of the motorcycles, sending the driver flying into the air. U.S. Capitol Police policy prohibits officers from pursuits outside the grounds of the Capitol without permission from a supervisor. Smith did not seek any approval and did not alert dispatchers that he was involved in a chase, prosecutors say. Authorities allege he drove around the man, leaving the victim lying in the roadway, and fled from the scene. Prosecutors say Smith “knowingly drove away from the scene of the crash without rendering aid, alerting medical authorities, and taking any other reasonable steps to obtain help for the victim.” He then drove back to a Capitol Police parking garage, parked the damaged police sedan, falsified a report to say he had started his shift later, and went inside and got keys for another vehicle, prosecutors said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials have asked the state medical board to draft new policies that would likely restrict gender dysphoria treatments for transgender youth as Florida amps up its ongoing attacks on the treatments amid the country’s culture wars. The officials are also arguing that such treatments should not be covered by Medicaid. In a lengthy report dated Thursday, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration said puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery have not been proven safe or effective in treating gender dysphoria. Tom Wallace, the state’s deputy director of Medicaid, signed off on the report. In response, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo wrote a letter to the state Board of Medicine asking it to review the findings and establish new standards for children seeking “these complex and irreversible procedures.” “Florida must do more to protect children from politics-based medicine,” Ladapo wrote. Many doctors and mental health specialists argue that medical treatment for transgender children is safe and beneficial and can improve their well-being, although rigorous long-term research on benefits and risks is lacking. Federal guidelines say gender-affirming care is crucial to the health and well-being of transgender and nonbinary children. Last year, the American Medical Association issued a letter urging governors to block any legislation prohibiting the treatment, calling such action “a dangerous intrusion into the practice of medicine.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Mayor Andre Dickens wants to spend $20 million to improve and subsidize child care and preschool in Atlanta. The money would include $5 million from the city, $5 million from the city’s public school system and $10 million from private donors, Dickens told WABE-FM. On Friday, the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students announced a $4.5 million pledge from the Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation and United Way of Greater Atlanta to help pay for the plan. The city will use federal pandemic relief money to pay for its $5 million. The money will pay to refurbish child care centers, to help families afford child care and to pay teachers bonuses. Dickens said many child care facilities haven’t been able to afford necessary repairs. “To get them up to par, we’re asking those child care centers – particularly on the south side of town, a lot of disinvested places – come to us, and we’ll give you grants to improve and modernize,” he said. The average monthly cost of child care in Georgia is about $1,000 per child. Courtney English, the mayor’s senior policy advisor, said that’s unaffordable for many families.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has set a new sentencing date for former state Rep. Ty Cullen, who earlier this year pleaded guilty to one felony count in connection with his acceptance of bribes when he was a lawmaker. He’s now due to be sentenced Oct. 20 instead of July 5. Cullen’s attorney, Birney Bervar, declined to comment. Former Senate Majority Leader Kalani English, who also pleaded guilty in a related case, is still scheduled to be sentenced July 5. The two Democrats each face up to 20 years in prison, but their sentences will depend on various factors. It’s possible they will get less because they pleaded guilty early. Cullen resigned his House seat representing Waipahu less than an hour before prosecutors announced the allegations in February. He entered a guilty plea the following week. His plea agreement with prosecutors says he accepted cash payments from a business owner identified as “Person A” dating as far back as 2014. That year, Cullen received $22,000 worth of casino chips from the business owner during a trip to a wastewater conference in New Orleans. The following year, Cullen introduced a bill as a favor to “Person A” that provided for a feasibility study and pilot project for the collection and treatment of wastewater, the agreement said, resulting in “Person A’s” company receiving a subcontract. The agreement says the business owner gave Cullen four cash payments totaling $23,000 on separate occasions from September 2019 through March 2020.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service violated environmental laws in approving exploratory drilling by a Canadian company hoping to build a gold mine west of Yellowstone National Park, two environmental groups said. The Idaho Conservation League and Greater Yellowstone Coalition filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to stop Excellon Idaho Gold’s Kilgore Gold Exploration Project in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Clark County. The groups cite potential harm to grizzly bears, wolverines, lynx, bighorn sheep, whitebark pine trees, Columbia spotted frogs and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Grizzly bears in the area are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and whitebark pine, a grizzly bear food source, has been proposed for listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Excellon Idaho Gold is a subsidiary of Toronto, Ontario-based Excellon Resources Inc. It acquired the project from British Columbia-based Otis Gold Corporation in 2020. Otis Gold Corporation said the area contains at least 825,000 ounces of gold near the surface and potentially more below. It said it was looking at possibly building an open-pit mine, if exploration finds that the gold is mostly near the surface, or an underground mine, if the gold is deeper. Those types of mines would require additional approval from the Forest Service.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Six candidates seeking the Republican nomination for governor support armed guards at schools and expanded mental health services to stop mass shootings like the ones at Ulvalde, Texas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the past two weeks. The candidates seeking the GOP nomination met in an hourlong televised debate Thursday night sponsored by WLS-TV, Univision and the League of Women Voters of Illinois. Darren Bailey, Richard Irvin, Max Solomon, Gary Rabine, Paul Schimpf and Jesse Sullivan will meet in the June 28 primary election to determine who will face the Democratic victor. Incumbent Gov. J.B. Pritzker is seeking a second term and is challenged by Chicago activist Beverly Miles.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All five judges on the state Supreme Court have sided with Gov. Eric Holcomb in a lawsuit that claimed a piece of legislation giving the General Assembly the ability to call itself into special sessions was unconstitutional. Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office were at odds over House Bill 1123, which was passed in the Statehouse in 2021. It gives the Legislature the power to start a session after the governor has declared an emergency. Holcomb vetoed it last year, claiming it went against the Indiana Constitution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto. “Government should serve as a steady foundation during a time of crisis,” Holcomb wrote in a letter to House Speaker Todd Huston in 2021, after the veto. “Avoidable legal challenges during a state of emergency will only serve to be disruptive to our state.” Meanwhile, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement Friday that the court had overstepped its authority in his view. “The Indiana Supreme Court provided answers to several areas of the law that the governor questioned,” Rokita wrote. “But in doing so, the court became a legislature today by overriding the intent of those who are directly elected by the people.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man who fatally shot two women before killing himself in the parking lot of a church had been romantically involved with one of the women and faced a court hearing this week on a charge of harassing her, investigators said Friday. Johnathan Lee Whitlatch, 33, of Boone, pulled up in a pickup truck to 22-year-old Eden Montang, 21-year-old Vivian Flores and another woman just before 7 p.m. Thursday outside Cornerstone Church on the outskirts of Ames and began shooting with a 9 mm handgun, they said. Montang and Flores were killed, Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald said, and Whitlatch shot himself. The women were friends and students at Iowa State University who were walking together to the church for a weekly service that is popular with university and high school students, the sheriff said. Whitlatch and Montang had recently broken up, Fitzgerald said, and investigators believe Whitlach’s intent was to kill her. “He was there for a specific purpose, which he accomplished,” the sheriff said. About 80 other students were inside the megachurch at the time, Fitzgerald said. The church is near Interstate 35, about 30 miles north of Des Moines. “Our hearts break for all involved, and we are praying for everyone affected, especially the family of the victims,” the church said in the statement. It held a prayer service for the victims Friday morning.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer did not use excessive force while arresting a man during a traffic stop four years ago, a federal grand jury ruled Thursday. Timothy Harris, who is Black, had alleged in the lawsuit that Officer Christopher Janes, who is white, violated his civil rights Jan. 23, 2018, by throwing him to the ground, punching him, and using pepper spray while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. Harris suffered a broken jaw and scrapes during the arrest. He was later convicted of parallel parking too far away from the curb and interference with a law enforcement officer. In closing arguments Thursday, Harris’ attorney, Carlton Odim, said Harris was not resisting arrest, and Janes became frustrated after Harris made what he considered a sarcastic remark to the officer, WIBW reports. But Janes’ attorney, Allen Glendenning, said bodycam video from the arrest showed that Harris was actively resisting and had displayed several “pre-attack” behaviors police are trained to look for during an arrest. U.S. District Judge Dan Crabtree issued an order late Thursday afternoon requiring Harris to cover Janes’ costs, including attorney fees. Harris had sued Janes for $1 million plus his own expenses. The most recent court document available, submitted in mid-January, put Janes’ expenses at $37,688.05 and Harris’ at $197,120.55.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A new campaign aims to get a U.S. postage stamp made in Muhammad Ali’s honor. Prominent figures like Louisville Mayor Greg Fisher and Lonnie Ali, the widow of the humanitarian and boxing great, launched a campaign Friday to have the U.S. Postal Service create a stamp bearing an image of “The Greatest.” “What better day than June 3, when Muhammad passed, to bring attention to this great honor that we really think he deserves,” Annie Moore, senior manager of content and communications of the Ali Center, said at a press conference there. And as Ali once said: “I should be a postage stamp. That’s the only way I’ll ever get licked.” A person must be dead for at least three years before they can become the subject of a postage stamp, and Ali passed six years ago. “The U.S. Postal Service stamp program honors members, extraordinary individuals who have contributed to American society, history, culture and environment,” said Fischer, who was appearing via Zoom from the U.S. Mayor’s Conference in Nevada. “Muhammad Ali more than meets the criteria in place.” There isn’t a proposal for what the stamp could look like, and Ali Center board member Peter Villegas said by Zoom that the selection process could take up to three years. The campaign will use social media to encourage people to back the effort.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: House-passed legislation to erase Robert E. Lee Day and Confederate Memorial Day from a list of Louisiana holidays was approved 28-4 on Friday by the state Senate. The measure by state Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, awaited a final House vote on non-controversial language changes before going to Gov. John Bel Edwards for his signature. The legislative session is set to end Monday. Neither of the holidays has been officially observed by state government in years. Backers of the bill said the holidays should be wiped from state law because they commemorated slavery and white supremacy. Handling the bill on the Senate floor, Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, disputed arguments from opponents of the bill that the holidays are part of state history. “It is important for us to realize that there is a way to commemorate history without glorifying the atrocities,” Luneau said. The two holidays are among those on a list of holidays a governor can proclaim in addition to permanent holidays that include Christmas and Independence Day. The governor is limited in the number he can proclaim in a year. Nobody spoke against the bill on the Senate floor Friday, but there was one significant change, nixing language eliminating George Washington’s birthday from the optional list in deference to the federal President’s Day holiday.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center is opening a breast milk donation center as the U.S. continues to deal with a baby formula shortage. The hospital said the breast milk center will open Monday in partnership with a regional milk bank. It’s the first in the Bangor area. A milk bank collects milk from mothers who have more than their babies need. There are a half-dozen other breast milk banks located between Portland and Belfast. The baby formula shortage largely stems from a plant in Michigan, which the FDA shut down in February due to contamination issues. The Biden administration’s response calls for importing foreign supplies and using the Defense Production Act to speed domestic production.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A challenge coin inscribed with the Maryland State Police logo along with graphic imagery and offensive language has some troopers concerned because they see it as a potential response to allegations of racial discrimination within the agency. The Baltimore Sun reports photos of the coin obtained by the newspaper show the state police insignia with images of female anatomy and references to people being offended. Challenge coins are tokens that people in organizations such as law enforcement collect to commemorate events or membership. Maryland State Police became aware of the coin in January, and the agency is investigating its creation, including whether someone in the agency was involved with the coins’ “design, manufacturing/purchase or sale,” spokeswoman Elena Russo said in an email. Russo said the agency hasn’t identified the person “responsible for this violation of Department policy” and urged anyone with information to contact internal affairs. Investigations of other coins have led to disciplinary or administrative actions, she said. The coin is being interpreted as a reaction to issues raised by Black troopers about disparate treatment around discipline, hiring and promotions and racist incidents within the agency, according to leaders of the Coalition of Black Maryland State Troopers and the Randallstown NAACP.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Democrats gathered in the city for their state party convention Saturday as they seek to regain the governor’s office and retain control of virtually every other source of political power in the state. Attorney General Maura Healey and state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz are both hoping to win the top office in November, but they must first go head-to-head in the fall primary. Healey won the party’s endorsement with 71% of the delegate votes Saturday, while Chang-Díaz won 29%, enough to get her name on the September primary ballot. “I am so so humbled, and I promise you this: I will be a governor who sees everyone, who listens to everyone and who makes sure that every voice in this commonwealth is heard,” Healey said in accepting the endorsement. Healey and Chang-Díaz are both popular among the party faithful, although Healey has the benefit of having run statewide twice – winning both times. Healey also has a financial edge. As of the beginning of May, she had more than $4.9 million in cash in her campaign account, compared to just $353,000 for Chang-Díaz. Either candidate would make history if they win in November. Despite its liberal reputation, Massachusetts has never elected a woman as governor. Healey would also become the state’s first openly gay candidate elected governor and the nation’s first openly lesbian chief executive of a state, while Chang-Díaz would be the first Latina and Asian American to hold the office.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Two candidates for governor, including a business consultant willing to spend personal millions, lost their final appeals Friday and will remain off the ballot in the Republican primary, the result of phony petition signatures that left them short of the 15,000 threshold. The state Supreme Court was the last stop for Perry Johnson and Michael Markey, who were doomed by forged signatures apparently created by paid circulators without the candidates’ knowledge. After state officials scratched those names, Johnson and Markey didn’t have enough valid ones. Detroit’s former police chief, James Craig, is in the same category. The state Supreme Court rejected his appeal on narrow procedural grounds, saying he first needed to go to the Michigan Court of Appeals. Nonetheless, he, too, will likely stay off the Aug. 2 ballot. “Today was the statutory deadline for ballots to be finalized. ... They are going to begin the printing process now,” said Tracy Wimmer, spokeswoman at the secretary of state’s office. The state elections bureau described widespread evidence of fraudulent signatures, names of dead voters and wrong addresses in a May 23 report – a conclusion that rocked the crowded field of GOP candidates vying to challenge Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A garbage company has stopped picking up yard waste in at least seven metropolitan cities due to a lack of drivers. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports Waste Management confirmed Thursday that it had suspended yard waste service in Robbinsdale, Stillwater, Columbia Heights, Little Canada, St. Anthony, St. Paul and Vadnais Heights due to a staffing shortage. Company spokeswoman Julie Ketchum said high demand for people with commercial driver’s licenses has created the shortage. She said the yard waste pickup suspensions could last weeks and could expand to other cities going forward.\n\nMississippi\n\nHernando: A flyer on behalf of the Ku Klux Klan was reportedly left on the steps of a mostly Black church in rural Mississippi. According to a community member’s Facebook post, the flyer is in support of “The Old Glory Knights of the Ku Klux Klan” and says the group is “alive and growing” in 14 states, including Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina. It was found May 29 on the steps of Union Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Hernando, in DeSoto County, the post said. The Old Glory Knights are a Klan chapter that appeared sometime last year, said Lydia Bates, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center. They have distributed flyers in the past, but flyer campaigns, Bates said, do not always mean the group is active. “Flyering is such a low-cost, low-stakes way to get their messaging out there to intimidate people, to attempt to recruit people,” Bates said. Flyering efforts by the KKK have dropped recently, going from more than 40 incidents in 2020 to fewer than 30 in 2021. Still, Bates said, the flyers can be scary for communities. A big goal of the flyers is to intimidate and make people think the Klan is bigger and stronger than it is in reality, she said. “A hate group built on a 150-plus year history of violence, you can’t dismiss it ... because there is violence in their words inherently,” Bates said.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A lawsuit challenging state control of the city’s police department will proceed after a Jackson County judge declined last week to dismiss it. Gwendolyn Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, contends in the lawsuit against the Kansas City Police Board of Commissioners that state control of the city’s police department is discriminatory and prevents Kansas City residents from having a say in how millions of tax dollars are spent in their city, The Kansas City Star reports. The board consists of the Kansas City mayor and four members appointed by Missouri’s governor. Kansas City is the only city in the state with a police department controlled by a state board. The current arrangement constitutes “taxation without representation” and violates Missouri’s Hancock Amendment, which limits state revenues and local taxes, Grant argues in the lawsuit. She also argues the current system is discriminatory because it involves a city with a large Black population. “The Court’s denial of the Police Board’s motion to dismiss clears the way for a long-overdue constitutional challenge to this antiquated system, and the antiquated values it represents,” Grant said in a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nBonner: Stat wildlife officials captured two young female sibling grizzly bears, releasing one back into the wild and euthanizing the other due to an infection stemming from losing a front left paw. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Friday it captured the 2-year-old females May 29 after they remained close to homes in the Blackfoot Valley about 10 miles from the town of Bonner in western Montana. The agency said the healthy sibling weighed about 130 pounds and the other about 90 pounds. The healthy grizzly was fitted with a radio collar and released into an undisclosed location. It’s not clear how the injured grizzly lost its paw, but a bicyclist found a grizzly bear paw April 11 on a road where, last fall, a sow grizzly and three yearling cubs had been seen. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Bear Manager Jamie Jonkel told The Missoulian that the agency is waiting on DNA results to see if the captured bears were part of the family group that included a male sibling. The mother grizzly had been known to raid sheds and garages north of Missoula. There have been no reports on the mother or male sibling this spring.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jim Pillen scored the endorsement Thursday of the Nebraska Cattlemen, a top advocacy group for the state’s ranchers. Pillen, a veterinarian and the owner of a hog farm operation, is running to replace current Gov. Pete Ricketts, a fellow Republican who leaves office in January because of term limits. Brenda Masek, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Cattlemen’s political action committee, said Pillen has “walked in our shoes” as an agricultural producer and would be a strong advocate for the industry at the Capitol. “Jim understands the concerns of the agriculture industry because he experiences them firsthand,” Masek said in a statement. Pillen is running against state Sen. Carol Blood, a Democrat and former Bellevue City Council member who was born and raised on a farm and has worked on various agricultural issues in the Legislature. Pillen won Nebraska’s Republican primary last month out of a crowded field that included an opponent backed by ex-President Donald Trump. Before he won the primary, Pillen secured support from Ricketts and the Nebraska Farm Bureau.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One of the busiest interchanges on the busiest freeway in the state is getting a three-year remake that transportation and elected officials say will ease access to Allegiant Stadium, T-Mobile Arena and the resort-lined Las Vegas Strip – but only after construction creates an even bigger traffic headache. “Will there be some minor inconvenience for a couple of years? Absolutely, there will be,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at a ceremony last week marking the start of $305 million worth of work to upgrade Interstate 15 and Tropicana Avenue. “I think the short-term sacrifice for the long-term gain is going to be something that we’re all really happy with,” the governor said. His comments were reported by the Las Vegas Sun. He called the interchange “the gateway to the entertainment and sports capital of the world.” Buttigieg credited Nevada with taking quick advantage of a federal infrastructure funding measure passed last year. It is expected to pay $25 million toward the project. Another $50 million comes from a federal grant awarded in 2020, and the state is expected to spend $230 million, mostly derived from fuel taxes, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Buttigieg said the project will improve a road designed long before the city looked the way it does today.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Education on Friday announced an initiative for children and parents to find a moment in their hectic schedules to pause, take a break and share that time with others. It’s called the “603 Moment” campaign, reflecting the state’s area code and the June 3 start. Gov. Chris Sununu planned its launch at a New Hampshire Fisher Cats baseball game, distributing small whiteboards to patrons and encouraging them to share their moment in writing. The initiative advertises, “Reset. Let Go. Grow.” “Just like the #HomeHikeChallenge from the last two years, our #603Moment initiative seeks to help New Hampshire kids, parents, and families refocus and appreciate the little things in life,” Sununu said in a statement. “Let’s channel these 603 Moments into positive change and renew important discussions on the importance of social and emotional health not just in our schools, but also in our communities.” Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said a moment “can occur on a walk or a lunch break, or perhaps it is a peaceful reflection while visiting a favorite place, or just a few deep breaths while in the midst of chaos.” Residents will be encouraged to share their moment on social media with the hashtag #603Moment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court has overturned a man’s sexual assault conviction because of DNA evidence – not because it exonerated him but because the statute of limitations ran out before the state filed charges once it got a match. Investigators had DNA evidence from the 2001 crime scene and from defendant Bradley Thompson by 2004 but didn’t get a conclusive match until 2016, due to the FBI’s updating of DNA testing guidance. In a 5-0 ruling Thursday with one justice not participating, the Supreme Court held that the five-year statute of limitations should have begun in 2010, when the FBI standards changed and the state lab could have generated a match. Thompson was indicted in 2017 and eventually convicted of criminal sexual contact and criminal trespass. The state had argued that the statute of limitations should have begun in 2016, when it updated its policy to reflect the new FBI guidance and achieved a match with Thompson’s DNA. Two lower courts had agreed. But the high court ruled that under New Jersey law, the statue of limitations began in this case in 2010 – when the state had the capability of matching the crime scene DNA with the defendant’s. If the Legislature meant to have it start when a match was achieved, it would have written that into the law, the court ruled Thursday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal authorities confirmed Friday that they are investigating how three firefighters battling the largest blaze burning in the U.S. were injured – one of them seriously – when a helicopter dropped part of a load of water on them. It happened the last weekend of May in northern New Mexico as a team of firefighters was working along the fire’s perimeter. They were among the more than 3,000 people assigned to the fire, which has been burning for nearly two months. An initial report from the Bureau of Land Management stated that the hotshot crew was holding a section of fire line about 10:30 a.m. in the Pecos Wilderness last Sunday as helicopters dropped water on the fire’s edge. “When a helicopter missed the identified drop area, the last of the load was delivered on top of several crew members,” the report said. Two received minor injuries, and the third underwent several surgeries at an Albuquerque hospital to repair skull fractures and a broken kneecap. The Bureau of Land Management confirmed Friday that an investigation was underway but declined to release any other information. The blaze was the result of two government planned burns aimed at clearing the forest of overgrown and dead vegetation. It destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate from numerous rural villages in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains east of Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: An employee who survived a racist mass shooting at a supermarket sought a court order Friday to question the 18-year-old gunman’s parents under oath in anticipation of filing a lawsuit against them. The filings in state Supreme Court ask that Payton Gendron’s parents, Paul and Pamela Gendron of Conklin, provide depositions by July 29 “to preserve their testimony, frame the complaint, and aid in identifying all possible defendants.” The filings also ask for evidence of the crime to be preserved. Attorney Terrence Connors filed the requests on behalf of Zaire Goodman, one of three people who survived being shot when the gunman opened fire on shoppers and employees at a Tops Friendly Market on May 14. Ten Black people died in the attack. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said Thursday that only Payton Gendron appeared to be criminally liable for the shooting. Gendron is charged in a 25-count indictment with hate-motivated domestic terrorism, first-degree murder, attempted murder and murder as a hate crime. He has pleaded not guilty. “No one else is on my radar to be charged,” Flynn said after Gendron was arraigned. Goodman’s filing, first reported by The Buffalo News, accuses Gendron’s parents of ignoring warning signs and “remain(ing) willfully blind to their son’s propensity for vicious conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRocky Mount: A historical marker alerting motorists that 1912 two-time Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe once played pro baseball in eastern North Carolina is back up more than two years after it was accidentally torn down. The replacement highway marker honoring Thorpe in downtown Rocky Mount was installed two weeks ago, state Department of Transportation spokesperson Andrew Barksdale told the Rocky Mount Telegram. A Thorpe marker was first installed in 1960 that told passersby that Thorpe came to the city in 1909 to play for the Rocky Mount Railroaders. Thorpe, a Sac and Fox/Potawatomi citizen, was stripped of his gold medals for the pentathlon and decathlon after losing his amateur status based on playing baseball in North Carolina. His medals were restored in the early 1980s, about 30 years after his death. The marker was reported missing in late 2019. It turned out the marker had been accidentally struck by a contract mowing service, which agreed to pay for a replacement, the newspaper reports. The replacement was ordered in May 2021, but delays occurred due to foundry staffing shortages and backup marker requests, according to Ansley Wegner, the state Highway Historical Marker Program administrator. “I’m glad to know that it is back in place and doing its job,” Wegner said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Supreme Court has rejected a last-ditch attempt to keep Dakota Access Pipeline construction security records private. The Bismarck Tribune reports the case involves documents the pipeline’s security overseer, TigerSwan, gave to the state’s Private Investigation and Security Board during a dispute over whether the North Carolina company operated illegally in North Dakota. That issue was resolved in September 2020 when the company agreed to pay the board a $175,000 settlement. The Intercept online news organization sued in November 2020 to obtain the documents. The pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer, has argued the documents are confidential. The state Supreme Court ruled in late April that they’re public records since the security board received them for use in public business. The Tribune reports that Energy Transfer asked the court May 12 to rehear the case. The justices refused in a May 23 order that did not explain their reasoning. Rehearings are rare for the Supreme Court. The justices last granted one in 2013, and then only to correct a misstatement in an opinion.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s new law allowing adults to carry concealed firearms without training classes or background checks goes into effect June 13. Gov. Mike DeWine signed the measure in March that marks one of the most significant changes to Ohio gun policy in more than 20 years. The new law gives people 21 or older who are legally allowed to own a gun permission to conceal that weapon without training or a permit. Gun owners may still opt to get a permit if they want to carry concealed firearms in other states where licenses are required. Ohio has agreements with more than three dozen states that allow residents to carry concealed guns elsewhere. The new law also eliminates the requirement that those carrying guns “promptly” inform law enforcement when stopped. Instead, the gun owner will have to inform only when an officer asks if the person is carrying a weapon. Ohio first passed a concealed carry weapons permit law in 2004. Since then, it’s been enormously popular, and Ohio lawmakers have shaved down training requirements and expanded places where permit holders may carry. The state doesn’t consider the total number of active license holders a public record, but an analysis from 2019 estimated that about 673,000 Ohioans have a permit, or 1 in 17.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The state’s black bear population continues to grow by 6% each year, and early summer means more bear encounters with people. Reported bear sightings increase in early summer, especially in eastern and central Oklahoma. A year ago in late May, a bear wandered into Norman. The animal was killed by state wildlife officials after attempts to tranquilize it failed. In most cases when bears wander into an Oklahoma town, the animals are tranquilized, captured and relocated by state wildlife officials. It is believed the bear in Norman traveled from southeastern Oklahoma, which has the largest population of bears in the state. Over the years, there have been other bear sightings across the state in early summer, even one that crossed Interstate 35. “These bears are likely young males traveling long distances, up to 80 miles one way, in search of females,” said Jeff Ford, senior wildlife biologist for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. “So whether you live in bear habitat or in the western reaches of their range, it is important to be bear wise.” Bears roam at night, and food left out such as birdseed, dog food and garbage are their frequent fast-food stops. It is estimated a black bear can smell food a mile away.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Residents of an affordable housing complex say their living conditions are inhospitable, and they want their rent back. Tenants at the Allen Fremont Plaza in Northeast Portland gathered in the courtyard of the three-story complex Wednesday, describing mold, vermin and people who don’t live there camping in the building’s indoor common areas, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Tenants Gary Bailey, John Brant, Huey Martin, Cathy Mayes and Lisa McConnell have filed lawsuits against Reach Community Development Corp. in Multnomah County Circuit Court. The affordable housing provider, which took over operations of the building seven years ago, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Emily Templeton, the attorney who filed the pro-bono suits, said each plaintiff is seeking a $14,400 refund for the rent paid, as well as a court order to fix the issues. The suit is limited to problems from the past year, but the documented complaints date back to 2013, she said. “This lawsuit is to just push the executives at Reach to finally do something,” Templeton said. Residents are also concerned with accumulation of trash, exposed wiring, the lack of an on-site manager, drug dealing and substance use, ineffective ventilation, fire hazards and inadequate weatherproofing, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick has conceded the Republican primary for U.S. Senate to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, ending his campaign as he acknowledged an ongoing statewide recount wouldn’t give him enough votes to make up the deficit. After a bitter campaign that blanketed the airwaves with millions of dollars in attack ads, McCormick issued a gracious concession Friday, vowing to help unite the party behind Oz. “It’s now clear to me with the recount largely complete that we have a nominee,” McCormick said at a campaign party at a Pittsburgh hotel. “And today I called Mehmet Oz to congratulate him on his victory.” McCormick’s concession cements a general election campaign between Oz, who was endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, and Democrat John Fetterman in what is expected to be one of the nation’s premier Senate contests. Already, the national parties are sponsoring attack ads on TV in a presidential battleground state that is still roiled by Trump’s baseless claims of a stolen election in 2020. The result could help determine control of the closely divided chamber, and Democrats view it as perhaps their best opportunity to pick up a seat in the race to replace retiring two-term Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Environmental officials are urging residents to avoid a stretch of the Blackstone River after finding that sewage was leaking into the river from a wastewater treatment plant Sunday. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said it’s investigating the discharge of partly treated wastewater from the Woonsocket Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. Officials said they were made aware of the discharge Sunday morning, and it is “currently ongoing.” Residents are being urged to avoid swimming, boating or fishing in the river from Cumberland Hill Road in Woonsocket to the Slater Mill Dam in Pawtucket. The advisory will remain in effect until further notice. The treatment plant is operated by the private firm Jacobs and treats about 10 million gallons of sewage a day, according to the department. The agency said it previously issued letters of noncompliance to the facility in November 2021 and March 2022 regarding “operations and maintenance concerns.” Jacobs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: At least some of the five Democrats seeking their party’s gubernatorial nomination are expected to debate, just more than a week before the state’s primary elections. The South Carolina Democratic Party announced Friday that it had sanctioned the production of the debate, to be co-hosted by South Carolina Educational Television and The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, for June 10. That’s a day before South Carolina’s Democrats are expected to assemble in Columbia for this year’s state party convention. Whether any of the gubernatorial candidates would debate before the June 14 contest had long been up for debate itself. A broadcast event had been scheduled for June 1, but former U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham’s refusal to commit to it prompted state Sen. Mia McLeod to issue a debate challenge via Twitter so that she and Cunningham could “give the people what they want.” Cunningham responded by saying that he welcomed “a fair debate” but balked at participation in the forum, which was to have been sponsored by the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Black Caucus. Cunningham’s concern was that the chair of that caucus is listed as someone paid by McLeod’s campaign. A review of McLeod’s expenditures lists chairman Brandon Upson as having been paid $900 by the campaign, remuneration Upson has said was tied to the campaign’s purchase of a list of about 100,000 names to be used for fundraising.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Backers of legal marijuana in the state are also fighting a different, unrelated ballot measure that would make it harder for voters to raise taxes and government spending. Amendment C, which voters will see on this week’s ballot, would have no bearing on a separate measure that will go to voters in November to legalize cannabis. If passed, Amendment C would require future ballot measures that increase taxes or government spending by $10 million over five years to receive a 60% majority. But increased spending and tax increases aren’t associated with Initiated Measure 27, the official name of the cannabis ballot measure on the November ballot. According to a fiscal impact statement associated with IM27, the measure isn’t expected to cost the state of South Dakota a dime. In fact, the state might save money. “There would be decreased expenses for the state due to decreased incarceration from the nullification of some marijuana-related laws,” Reed Holwegner, the director of the Legislative Research Council, wrote in what’s formally called a fiscal note that was sent to the Secretary of State’s Office in October. Unlike the last go-round in which the public voted to legalize pot at the polls, IM27 does not establish any regulatory structure around commercial marijuana sales.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city got dragged in the comments Wednesday after officials attempted to rebut a viral TikTok that highlighted Memphis’ persistent problems with potholes. The post by Traynor Jennings III showed him standing waist-deep in what he called a pothole but the city described as erosion from a damaged underground waterline. “Hey, City of Memphis, there are holes like this everywhere,” Jennings said. The TikTok has been viewed about 3 million times, putting the potholes that are ubiquitous throughout Memphis in the harsh glare of the viral spotlight. The city did not take kindly to Jennings’ TikTok and offered a rebuttal Wednesday afternoon. The video “may be funny to watch but was unwise to remove the metal plate and place yourself into the cavity of washed away soil in the middle of the street. Your best bet is to call 311 and report road damage and potholes,” the city said. But that’s not the case, Jennings said. He took to Facebook and the radio show circuit to push back on the city’s claim that he moved a steel plate that likely weighs hundreds of pounds. The city later amended its post and removed the reference to moving the metal plate. A 4-foot-by-4-foot steel plate weighs about 652 pounds, according to onlinemetals.com. Mayor Jim Strickland, in an interview with WREG, apologized for the city’s comments.\n\nTexas\n\nCenterville: The search for a murderer who had killed on behalf of Mexican drug cartels and who stabbed and injured the driver of a prison transport bus last month when he escaped custody ended late Thursday in a shootout about 220 miles away. He led officers on a brief chase in a stolen truck before he was gunned down. Authorities believe while Gonzalo Lopez, 46, roamed free, he killed a man and his four grandsons, then stole an AR-15-style rifle and a pistol from their ranch near Centerville, as well as the truck he drove to Atascosa County, south of San Antonio, where he was fatally shot by officers. “This is something that you can’t imagine ever to happen in a small community like this,” said Tuffy Loftin, 61, a pastor in Centerville who knew the family. Centerville residents had been worried ever since May 12, when Lopez overpowered the officer who was driving him and 15 other prisoners near their community between Dallas and Houston. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice is still investigating how Lopez broke free from his restraints and escaped a caged area of the bus where he had been held. Following his escape, law enforcement had been vigorously patrolling Highway 7 and other roads in Centerville and escorting many of the city’s nearly 1,000 residents to their homes to ensure they felt safe.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A recent study suggests nearly half of the state’s residents are using too much water in an effort to keep their grass healthy. Using aerial photographs depicting lawns in two Utah County cities, then cross-referencing the data with secondary water bills from thousands of anonymous customers, Brigham Young University’s Civil and Construction Engineering professor Rob Sowby’s paper points to widespread overuse in the Beehive State. “The gut reaction is, more water equals more green. But there’s a curve; there’s an optimal point. And as you put more water on, that’s all you’re doing, you’re not making it any healthier,” Sowby told the Deseret News. The overuse is problematic on two fronts – first, the West is battling a historically bad drought. Water districts are enforcing unprecedented water cuts, while the Great Salt Lake and two of the nation’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are at all-time lows. Water hawks across the region are warning residents that now is not the time to be using too much water on nonessential landscapes, like a lawn. Second, too much water will harm grass. “Yes, you put more water on, and it gets healthier, but then it peaks out. And as you put more water on, that’s all you’re doing – you’re just wasting water. It doesn’t get any healthier,” Sowby said. An abundance of weeds like crabgrass or thatch, fungal growth like mushrooms, standing water or runoff after irrigation, yellowing and eventually dying patches of grass are all signs of overwatering.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott has vetoed a land conservation bill that supporters say intended to protect biodiversity and improve climate resilience. The legislation set goals of conserving 30% of Vermont land by 2030 and 50% by 2050. Scott, a Republican, wrote in his veto message to lawmakers Thursday that the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources testified multiple times against this bill, saying the conservation goals in it “are unnecessarily tied to – and unreasonably limited to – permanent protection.” “The Agency has repeatedly said that permanent preservation has not been, and cannot be, the state’s exclusive conservation tool and this bill, intentional or not, would diminish the existing and successful conservation tools we have,” Scott wrote. House Speaker Jill Krowinski and House Natural Resources Chair Amy Sheldon said the act was part of a package of environmental legislation that sought to build on the state’s conservation work and help reduce the impact of climate change on communities, and now joins other environmental protection legislation that Scott has vetoed in recent years. Environmental groups also criticized the move. The bill would have created a statewide conservation plan, given the current and future development pressures on Vermont’s landscape, combined with the “historic biodiversity loss and climate change,” the Vermont Natural Resources Council said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: The General Assembly’s recently approved budget appropriates money to create a new state park in Culpeper County that would include two Civil War battlefields. The spending plan sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin last week would create a 1,700-acre park focused on Culpeper County’s Brandy Station and Cedar Mountain battlefields, which have been preserved by the American Battlefield Trust, the Star-Exponent reports. Proponents say Culpeper’s location between Manassas National Battlefield Park and the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park will boost visitation. Many of the sites the Culpeper Battlefields State Park will include are already open to the public, under the stewardship of the battlefield trust or other organizations. “As awe-inspiring as these preserved lands are, we came to realize the wherewithal and marketing muscle of the Virginia State Park System was needed to make the battlefields into a genuine heritage tourism destination and economic engine for the community,” Jim Campi, the battlefield trust’s chief policy and communications officer, told the newspaper. The budget is awaiting action from Youngkin, who has indicated his support for the park, according to the newspaper. Under the budget language, the park would be created by July 1, 2024.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A woman who was struck in the eye with a so-called rubber bullet during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, causing an injury that required surgery, has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Seattle Police Department. Nikita Tarver alleges an officer targeted her – the only Black person in a crowd of white protesters – when she raised a sign showing the names of police violence victims, the Seattle Times reports. Tarver was likely struck with a 40 mm foam-tipped projectile, one of several “less-lethal” weapons a federal judge later enjoined police from using against protesters. The rounds can cause serious injury. Their manufacturer warns against firing them at people’s heads. The lawsuit joins dozens of others filed by protesters who claim police used excessive force against nonviolent demonstrators during the 2020 summer protests. The Seattle city attorney’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit claims Tarver and a friend were walking back to their car when Tarver hoisted a sign. “Within seconds of holding her sign up so that it could be seen, Nikita felt a blast in her left eye,” the lawsuit says. “Nikita screamed out in terror. Her entire face felt like it was burning and she felt like she was going to lose her eye.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is scaling back its community testing events for the coronavirus, Gov. Jim Justice said. Justice said Thursday that the decision was made due to the availability and convenience of at-home test kits for COVID-19. The state has provided free community testing since the start of the pandemic in 2020. People who have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with the virus can still find testing sites at places such as pharmacies and participating health departments and medical centers. “There are still plenty of places out there where you can find access to free testing. But, to be perfectly honest, what’s happening right now with our community testing events is that they’re set up all day, but maybe only two people come by,” Justice said. “We’re just spending money that could be better spent somewhere else right now. That said, if things happen to get worse, we’ll be right back out there.” The state has a map of available testing sites on the Department of Health and Human Resources’ website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A national meatpacking company with a facility in Green Bay has agreed to pay about $15,000 to settle allegations that unsafe practices during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic sickened and killed Wisconsin workers. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration announced the settlement last week, and it applies to seven JBS Foods USA plants, including the Green Bay facility. The company closed that plant in late April 2020 after nearly 150 infections were linked to it. The plant reopened about a week later. OSHA said that by mid-August, 357 infections had been confirmed at the plant. OSHA cited the plant in October 2020 on grounds that the company didn’t implement timely and effective measures to control the disease’s spread. The agency hailed the settlement as a step toward protecting workers. Jarrett Brown, who worked at the Green Bay plant until early 2020, called the deal a slap on the wrist. “This is not punishment for them,” Brown said. JBS officials said in a statement that they’ve established COVID-19 protocols and plan to implement them across their U.S. facilities.\n\nWyoming\n\nKirby: A local distillery has partnered with Yellowstone National Park to release a limited-edition bourbon in honor of the park’s 150th anniversary. Wyoming Whiskey announced in a press release that its National Parks No. 2 straight bourbon whiskey comes in tandem with the brand’s continuing partnership with Yellowstone Forever, the official nonprofit partner of Yellowstone National Park. The National Parks No. 2 bottle is the second collectible release in an annual national park series that debuted in April 2021. It is now available in Yellowstone National Park and throughout Wyoming and is also available in select U.S. markets and online from ReserveBar, Flaviar and Caskers. The inaugural release of Wyoming Whiskey’s national parks series contributed over $120,000 to the National Park Foundation in 2021. Wyoming Whiskey said it has committed to donating $150,000 to Yellowstone Forever in the park’s historic 150th year. For every bottle sold, the distillery said it will donate $5 up to a maximum donation of $150,000 to support Yellowstone Forever’s preservation mission. The straight bourbon whiskey is made from 68% corn, 20% wheat and 12% malted barley – all Wyoming-made, non-genetically modified grains – and bottled at 105 proof. The company said the water used is sourced from a local limestone aquifer.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/13/school-food-shortages-elk-sheds-tire-city-status-retained-news-around-states/119045212/", "title": "School food shortages, elk sheds tire: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAlexander City: Schools across the state have been facing food shortages, education officials say. Disruptions in the workforce needed to serve and deliver meals – along with supplies of food and packaging materials – are behind the shortages, Al.com reports. State education officials say every school district in Alabama is facing shortages to some degree. Alexander City Schools recently warned parents that it’s experiencing supply chain issues with its food vendors. In recent weeks, the school system hasn’t received food deliveries because suppliers are short on supplies, drivers and warehouse employees. The school system asked parents to feed breakfast to their students at home if possible. In southeast Alabama, Dothan City Schools asked parents last month to prepare for a possible shift to remote learning due to the district’s food supply issues.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Several Republican state lawmakers are urging easier access to ivermectin amid the pandemic, though that drug is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for preventing or treating COVID-19. Senate Majority Leader Shelley Hughes of Palmer said she urged Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state health commissioner to consider supplying Alaskans with vitamins and drugs, including ivermectin, “that some Alaskan physicians are prescribing but pharmacies aren’t filling.” Three Republican House members testified about ivermectin at a recent state pharmacy board meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. “Maybe the pharmacists could be directed – or directed’s the wrong word – suggested that they allow the doctors to actually be doctors and do their jobs,” said Rep. Kevin McCabe of Big Lake. In a letter to the House members after the meeting, the board’s chair, Justin Ruffridge, a Kenai Peninsula pharmacist, noted potential legal liability for pharmacists for drugs they dispense and said pharmacists were free to use their “professional judgment” when deciding whether to fill prescriptions. He said the board has not threatened pharmacists’ licenses around the issue but said reports of misuse of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 “should give most prescribers and pharmacists reason to pause.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has blocked the state from collecting $1.1 million from the city of Flagstaff to compensate for its minimum wage that is higher than the state’s rate, ruling that the state missed a deadline for the assessment and was stretching a law targeting higher voter-approved city wages to collect its indirect costs. But the ruling from Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith released Monday sidestepped the question of whether the assessments are unconstitutional. The state minimum wage reached $12 an hour in 2020 with inflation adjustments after that and now stands at $12.15 an hour. Flagstaff voters in 2016 phased in higher city minimum wages, which hit $15 per hour this year with annual increases thereafter. Smith’s ruling said a law enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2019 targeting higher local minimum wages set a July 31 deadline for setting the yearly assessment. The state missed that deadline. The judge also said the state can’t charge for the indirect costs of Flagstaff’s higher minimum wage, which is what it did in coming up with the $1.1 million figure. The state is exempt from paying the higher minimum wage Flagstaff voters approved in 2016, and the law authorizing assessments does not specifically say the state can calculate the indirect costs of paying contractors.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers sent the governor a congressional redistricting plan that critics say weakens the influence of minority voters in the Little Rock area by splitting the state’s most populous county among three U.S. House districts. The measure splits portions of Pulaski County, a heavily Democratic county that includes Little Rock, among the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts. The county is currently in the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent years. Republicans hold all four of the state’s U.S. House seats and a majority of both chambers of the Legislature. Democrats have criticized the plan for moving predominantly Black and Hispanic precincts out of the 2nd District and accused Republicans of trying make a GOP district even redder. Arkansas is the only former Confederate state that has not elected a Black representative to the U.S. House. “It’s going to disenfranchise African American communities, regardless of the intent,” state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, said before the House approved the measure last week. Supporters of the plan say splitting Pulaski County makes sense given its location in the middle of the state. They also say it helps limits the number of counties split up. Opponents of splitting up counties have said it divides up communities and their interests.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: Recordings indicate the pilot of a twin-engine plane nose-dived into a San Diego suburb despite a growingly concerned air traffic controller who repeatedly warned the pilot to climb in altitude – information that will be examined by investigators who arrived at the crash scene Tuesday. The Cessna 340 smashed into a UPS van, killing the driver, and then hit two houses to ignite just after 12 p.m. Monday in Santee, a suburb of 50,000 people east of San Diego. United Parcel Service of America Inc. held a moment of silence Tuesday for van driver Steve Krueger, who was remembered for making work better with his laugh, the company said in a statement. The plane’s owner, an Arizona physician, also died, and an elderly couple whose home went up in flames after it was hit suffered burns. It was unclear whether others were on board the plane. An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash scene Tuesday morning, according to agency spokeswoman Jennifer Gabris. Investigators will review radar data, weather information, air traffic control communication, airplane maintenance records and the pilot’s medical records, she said. The plane had planned to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport in San Diego when it crashed.\n\nColorado\n\nPine: Wildlife officials say an elusive elk that has been wandering the hills with a car tire around its neck for at least two years has finally been freed of the obstruction. The 41/ 2 -year-old, 600-pound bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, southwest of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquilized, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the encumbrance because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tire. “We would have preferred to cut the tire and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic, and we had to just get the tire off in any way possible,” Officer Scott Murdoch said. Murdoch and fellow officer Dawson Swanson estimated the elk shed about 35 pounds with the removal of the tire, the antlers and debris inside the tire. Wildlife officers first spotted the elk with the tire around its neck in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. They said they have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife become entangled in a number of items, including swingsets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSimsbury: A plot of land that was once a thriving tobacco farm where Martin Luther King Jr. worked as a college student in the 1940s will be protected for its historic and cultural significance to the state’s civil rights history. Last month’s finalized sale of the 288-acre parcel of land was announced Friday. The nonprofit Trust for Public Land and the town of Simsbury plan to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday for the Meadowood site. Nearly 130 acres will be set aside for recreational access and roughly 120 acres for working farmland. The rest will be saved for future needs of the town of Simsbury, while 2 acres will be kept for historic preservation purposes. Simsbury voters in May overwhelmingly authorized $2.5 million to purchase the property. Various state agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the George Dudley Seymour Trust, individuals and foundations have provided an additional $4 million. Historians believe King’s experiences in Connecticut influenced his decision to become a minister and civil rights leader. He was among a group of students from Atlanta’s Morehouse College recruited by tobacco growers to work in the fields to earn money for tuition. “On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see,” King wrote his father in June 1944. “After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit any where we want to.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor, who is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted Monday on public corruption charges. An indictment issued by a New Castle County grand jury charges Kathleen McGuiness, 58, with felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, plus misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with state procurement laws. Prosecutors said the charges include allegations that McGuiness hired her daughter and one of her daughter’s friends, both high school seniors at the time, as temporary employees in May 2020, even though other temporary employees had to leave their positions because of the lack of available work amid the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said Elizabeth McGuiness, who has not been charged, continued to be paid even after enrolling at a college in South Carolina last August, and she was still listed as an employee as recently as Aug. 28 of this year. She was initially listed as a “public information officer” and later as an “intern.” McGuiness also is charged with orchestrating a 2019 no-bid “communications services” contract for a company she had used as a campaign consultant when running for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University and Netflix have announced a $5.4 million endowed scholarship to honor the late actor, writer, producer and Howard alumnus Chadwick Boseman, WUSA-TV reports. The Chadwick A. Boseman Memorial Scholarship will provide incoming students in the College of Fine Arts, recently named for Boseman, with a four-year scholarship to cover the full cost of tuition, the university said. “This scholarship embodies Chadwick’s love for Howard, his passion for storytelling, and his willingness to support future generations of Howard students,” Howard University President Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick said in a release. “I am thankful for the continuous support and partnership of Chadwick’s wife, Mrs. Simone Ledward-Boseman, and to Netflix for this important gift.” The scholarship was established with the support of Ledward-Boseman, with Netflix as the inaugural donor. The first four scholarships were earmarked for one recipient in each class beginning this fall, and they’ll continue to be distributed to an incoming freshman every year. The university said the scholarship will focus on students who exemplify exceptional skills in the arts, reminiscent of Boseman, and who demonstrate financial need.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state is investigating dozens of local governments, performing arts centers, the Miami Marlins, a law enforcement counterterrorism unit and a concert by singer Harry Styles for violating a law prohibiting businesses and governments from requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. About 120 cases are being reviewed for violations of Florida’s “vaccine passport” law, which took effect last month and can result in a $5,000 fine per violation, according to a public records request from the Orlando Sentinel. The law is being challenged in court and conflicts with a Biden administration order that companies with over 100 employees require them to be vaccinated or face weekly coronavirus testing. In central Florida, the list includes Orange County government; the Orange County Convention Center; AdventHealth, one of the state’s largest health care systems; several performing arts venues; and the Amway Center, which is home to the Orlando Magic and recently hosted a concert by Styles whose tour mandated attendees either be vaccinated or have a negative test. “At this point … the courts have not reached the final decision, but the indication is that the Florida law flies in the face of our Florida Constitution and perhaps in the face of common sense,” Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings told the newspaper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials in Fulton County, where election operations are already under review by the state, have fired two workers accused of shredding paper voter registration applications, according to a county statement released Monday. Preliminary information indicates the employees checked out batches of applications for processing, and they are alleged to have shredded some of the forms, the Fulton County statement said. Fellow employees reported the alleged actions to their supervisor Friday morning, and the two employees were fired that day. The county statement said the applications were received in the past two weeks. Fulton County includes most of the city of Atlanta, where voters are set to go to the polls Nov. 2 to elect a mayor, City Council members and other municipal officials. The deadline to register to vote in that election was Oct. 4. It’s not immediately clear whether the 300 voter registration records in question were lost, county spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. “Normally, processing a voter registration application involves entering them in the state system, updating them, verifying their information,” she said. “That is the matter that’s under investigation – was that process completed.” Voters don’t register by party in Georgia, so the applications had no party affiliation.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: The median sales price of a single-family home in Maui County dropped below $1 million last month as people priced out of the market have chosen to pause their homebuying. The Maui News reports the median sales price for a single-family home in the county stood at $996,500 in September. That’s up 27.3% from the same month last year. But it’s below levels from May through August, when the median topped $1 million for four straight months. Median sales prices for single-family homes in Kauai and Honolulu counties have also topped $1 million this year. The September report from the Realtors Association of Maui said declining affordability has had “a significant impact” on homebuyers who have been priced out of the market. Association President Keone Ball said Sunday that he believes prices will go back up. “The problem is the volume – you know, there isn’t enough for sale,” he said, noting that low inventory combined with high demand for affordable housing is also a nationwide problem. Pending sales decreased 4.3% for single-family homes in Maui County but increased 5.7% for condominiums. Ball said investment in condos may have spiked due to the settling of the COVID-19 pandemic, affordability and condominiums being “the only option.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials will make available up to $200,000 to be divided into payments for hunters and trappers who kill wolves in the state through next summer. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game late last month entered into an agreement with a nonprofit hunting group to reimburse the expenses for a proven kill. The agreement follows a change in Idaho law aimed at killing more wolves that are blamed for attacking livestock and reducing deer and elk herds. Montana this year also expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the request of environmental groups concerned about the expanded wolf killing in the two states, last month announced a yearlong review to see if wolves in the U.S. West should be relisted under the Endangered Species Act. Idaho has managed wolves since they were taken off the list in 2011. State wildlife managers had been incrementally increasing wolf harvest during that time – but not fast enough for lawmakers, who earlier this year passed the law backed by some trappers and the powerful ranching sector. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves before federal authorities would take over management.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Al Capone died nearly 75 years ago, but it’s clear interest in the infamous Chicago gangster is very much alive after some of his prized possessions were auctioned off over the weekend for at least $3 million. The Chicago Tribune reports Capone’s family sold several of his belongings, including what was billed as his favorite gun, at auction in California, where his three surviving granddaughters live. The event, called “A Century of Notoriety: The Estate of Al Capone,” was held at a private club in Sacramento and attracted nearly 1,000 registered bidders, including 150 who attended the nearly four-hour-long event in person. Among the items up for auction was a bear-shaped humidor as well as diamond jewelry and some family photographs. The most popular item proved to be Capone’s favorite Colt .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, which went for $860,000. The story of Capone, the original “Scarface,” is a familiar one, thanks in large part to a host of movies, television shows and books about the mobster. Called Public Enemy No. 1 after the 1929 “Valentine’s Day Massacre” in which seven members of a rival bootlegger gang were gunned down in a Lincoln Park parking garage, Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1934. He spent 11 years locked up in Alcatraz and died of a heart attack in 1947.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 6,600 Afghan refugees who began arriving at the Indiana National Guard’s Camp Atterbury training post nearly six weeks ago are awaiting resettlement. Additional evacuees are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear how many, said Mark Howell, regional spokesman for the federal Transportation Security Administration overseeing Operation Allies Welcome. Officials said they’re also uncertain if the refugees will be permanently resettled by early November, as hoped. Howell said Friday that many Afghans are still completing medical and security screening checks. Once cleared, they’ll work with nongovernmental organizations to determine housing assignments, sponsor families and work authorizations before they can leave the post. Camp Atterbury, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, is one of eight sites in the U.S. that the Department of Defense is using for Afghan special immigrant visa applicants, their families and other Afghan personnel. Exodus Refugee Immigration, an Indianapolis agency, has helped at least four Afghan families resettle in the city in the past month, Executive Director Cole Varga said. They were all U.S. citizens or had visas and family ties to the area. It’s unclear how many Afghans have resettled in Indiana, but the state is projected to take 490, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has found a local activist guilty of a felony theft count for taking a police flyer used to identify protesters from an officer’s back pocket during a protest last year. Alexandria Dea, 27, was found guilty of first-degree theft Monday by Judge David Porter after she waived her right to a jury trial and consented to allow the judge to base his decision on facts already on the record. Dea is expected to seek a deferred judgment when she’s sentenced Dec. 7. Prosecutors have said Dea picked up and threw a police radio that fell to the ground as the officer scuffled with a protester July 1, 2020. She was also accused of taking the intelligence bulletin from an officer’s back pocket during the confrontation, then giving it to another Black Lives Matter activist who gave it to a television reporter. Dea and the other activist had also initially been charged with a rarely used count of leaking intelligence data, but the charge was dismissed in July after a judge ruled that the bulletin did not count as “intelligence data.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has facilitated donations totaling $1 million for an effort to investigate wrongful convictions in Wyandotte County. The money was raised by Team Roc, which is the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation, the Kansas City Star reports. Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, called it “a huge investment,” adding that the ability to look at these cases is going to shine a light on what the group needs to do to provide a just criminal legal system in Wyandotte County. Among those injustices is the wrongful conviction of Lamonte McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for two murders he did not commit in Kansas City, Kansas. Another is the case of Olin “Pete” Coones Jr., who spent 12 years in prison before he was exonerated of a Wyandotte County murder – only to die from cancer that went undiagnosed 108 days after he was freed. About 40 others have asked the innocence project to investigate their convictions in Wyandotte County, Rojo Bushnell said Monday. In September, Team Roc filed a petition seeking records from the Kansas City, Kansas, police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city has agreed to pay $75,000 to a couple who say police removed them from their car and frisked them because they were Black and driving a nice vehicle. But in an unusual condition of the payment, the couple and their lawyers are forbidden from criticizing the Louisville Metro Government or the police officers involved. The prohibition includes criticisms in statements to the media or on social media, according to a copy of the settlement obtained under open records laws. Michael Abate, a lawyer for the Louisville Courier Journal and the Kentucky Press Association, said the stipulations are “totally improper.” “The city is paying to silence its critics,” he said. “It is paying them off. And it seems designed to impede reform. It is bad policy and really troubling.” In a statement, First Assistant County Attorney Ingrid Geiser said the couple “are not prohibited from talking truthfully about what happened during their traffic stop,” though she said the language “should have more accurately reflected the agreement of the parties.” In their federal lawsuit, Anthony Parker Sr. and Demetria Firman, who are now married, say they were pulled over in 2018 for failing to use a turn signal, but body camera footage from one of the officers showed their turn signal was on.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s problem of wasted COVID-19 vaccine shots continues to balloon, with about 224,000 doses thrown out across Louisiana as health providers can’t find enough residents willing to roll up their sleeves. The number of trashed doses has nearly tripled since the end of July, even as the state grappled with a fourth, deadly surge of the coronavirus pandemic during that time that led to increased interest in the vaccines. The latest data provided by the Louisiana Department of Health showed 223,918 doses of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been thrown out. That’s relatively small compared to the 4.4 million vaccine doses administered around the state. But while waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, the throwing away of doses in the United States comes as millions of people around the globe still are waiting for the opportunity to get inoculated against COVID-19. Most of Louisiana’s wasted vaccine doses happened because vials containing the shots were opened, but hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other providers couldn’t find someone to take the doses, health department spokesperson Kevin Litten said. More than 21,500 shots simply weren’t used before their expiration dates. Louisiana has one of the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmental regulators will soon undertake a statewide investigation to find concentrations of long-lasting environmental pollutants. The investigation stems from the state’s efforts to mitigate a class of chemicals known as PFAS, also called “forever chemicals.” The substances are a problem in some parts of Maine because of the long-standing use of municipal sludge and paper mill waste as farm fertilizer, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state set aside $30 million to test for the chemicals and install filtration systems in areas with contaminated water. Maine officials also plan to help farmers and start cleaning up sites, the Press Herald reports. Maine is hiring and training 17 new staff members for the effort. The state needs to decide which of more than 500 sludge application sites should be prioritized for testing. Sewage sludge as farm fertilizer has caused environmental problems in other parts of the country as well. The chemicals also carry human health risks.\n\nMaryland\n\nGaithersburg: Four police officers will not be charged for fatally shooting a Black man they said fired first during a late-night foot chase in January. A grand jury declined to charge the officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department due to lack of evidence in a decision announced last week. The officers, members of a plainclothes street crimes unit, told investigators they saw a “muzzle flash” from a gun aimed at them by Kwamena Ocran, 24, according to their recorded statements released by Montgomery County prosecutors. One officer said he heard a round pass by his head. All four fired on Ocran, who was running away from them. He was hit eight times, according to a report from prosecutors. The shooting happened outside an apartment complex after officers said they received a tip that Ocran was illegally carrying a gun he intended to sell, according to the report. The incident was not recorded on video. Another officer arrived at the scene moments later and recorded footage of a gun next to Ocran’s body, but investigators could not find evidence he had fired it. Crime scene technicians failed to find shell casings from Ocran’s gun – only the 23 shell casings from the officers’ guns, prosecutors said. Howard County Deputy State’s Attorney Christopher Sandmann told The Washington Post that investigators had prepped Ocran’s hands for gunshot reside analysis, but there was a “mistake or miscommunication,” and his hands were never swabbed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by founding father Alexander Hamilton during the Revolutionary War and believed stolen decades ago from the state archives has been returned following a federal appeals court decision, officials said Tuesday. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin hailed the homecoming, after last week’s decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a previous ruling by a district court judge. The letter was reputedly stolen between 1938 and 1945 by a “kleptomaniacal cataloguer” who worked at the archives, according to the court decision. Hamilton wrote the letter to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army. Dated July 21, 1780, the letter resulted in Massachusetts sending troops to Rhode Island “to bolster the embattled French forces,” the appeals court wrote. Galvin, whose office oversees the archives and the Commonwealth Museum, said he was pleased the court ruled “that this historical treasure belongs to the people.” The letter is expected to be put on display at the museum for special events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, Galvin said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCenter Line: An employee at a suburban Detroit nursing home filled out absentee ballot applications for two dozen residents without consulting them before the 2020 election, authorities said Monday. The case was one of three cases of alleged fraud announced by the state. “Our election system is secure, and today’s charges demonstrate that in the rare circumstances when fraud occurs, we catch it and hold the perpetrators accountable,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. A woman who worked at the Father Murray home in Center Line was charged with election forgery and signature forgery. In another case, a Detroit woman was accused of signing her grandson’s name on an absentee ballot and returning it, even though he had decided to vote at a polling place. In a third investigation, a woman who served as a guardian was charged in several communities after authorities said she fraudulently submitted 26 absentee ballot applications and sought to have ballots mailed directly to her. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel praised local election officials for noticing irregularities. “We will not hesitate to prosecute anyone who attempts to undermine our elections,” Nessel said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBeaver Bay: A Lake Superior lighthouse plans to welcome visitors back for an annual memorial honoring the sailors who died when the Edmund Fitzgerald sank. Every Nov. 10, the day the ship sank in a gale in 1975, the Split Rock Lighthouse just south of Beaver Bay holds a beacon lighting. Lighthouse officials announce the names of all 29 sailors who died as a bell tolls, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The lighthouse didn’t allow visitors to attend last year’s ceremony because of COVID-19 concerns. People had to listen through an online livestream. Lighthouse officials say this year’s ceremony will be a hybrid, with the lighthouse grounds open to the public and a livestream on the Minnesota Historical Society’s Facebook and YouTube pages for those who can’t attend. The ceremony will begin at 4:30 p.m. “There’s something about being here on site and hearing the bell ring and the names being read off and then seeing the beacon turned on right after that. There’s just something very special about that,” said Hayes Scriven, the lighthouse site manager. “It’s just a way to connect with the past and remember that Lake Superior is a fickle animal, and you’ve got to respect the power and not take it for granted.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Book Festival is being shown online after the in-person event was canceled because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers say videos of 31 panel discussions have been recorded in the past month. Those became available Tuesday on the festival’s website, msbookfestival.com. “We’ve got an amazing group of authors and moderators who have rallied to record more than 35 hours of great conversations about books and writing,” Executive Director Ellen Daniels said in a news release. “Honoring these writers and continuing to engage our loyal and growing community of book lovers is what the festival is all about.” Among the authors speaking are Curtis Wilkie, Kiese Laymon, Nic Stone, W. Ralph Eubanks, Jerry Mitchell, Catherine Pierce, Beth Ann Fennelly, Mitch Landrieu, William Ferris, Angie Thomas, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Robert Khayat and Kai Bird. The festival originally was scheduled for Aug. 21 at the Mississippi Capitol and nearby Galloway United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson. Organizers switched to the online format because the state was experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases at the time.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Data shows that most of the people who participated in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine lottery were already immunized before the program started. The incentive program was started in July as Missouri struggled to control a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the more transmissible delta variant in less-vaccinated communities. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted the last of the drawings in the program Friday. Among the participants, 57,117 adults got the shot after the program was announced, while nearly 600,000 got the shot beforehand, The Kansas City Star reports. The program also had more than 39,000 entries from children 12 and up. In total, the state will pay out $9 million to 900 prizewinners, who will each receive $10,000 in either cash or, for the youth winners, scholarship accounts. Anyone who had gotten at least one dose of a vaccine was eligible to enter, but separate drawings were conducted for those who had already gotten a shot, making the odds of winning higher for the newly vaccinated. Just over 48% of Missouri’s total population is fully vaccinated now, up from about 40% when the incentive program was announced.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: All local calls in the state must be dialed with the 406 area code to connect beginning Oct. 24 due to changing federal regulations. Montana’s 406 area code currently allows seven-digit dialing to complete local calls. That will change this month due to a Federal Communications Commission order designating 988 as the new nationwide number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Some seven-digit phone numbers in Montana’s 406 area code begin with 988. To prevent misdialing the 988 Lifeline, all local calls in Montana must be dialed with the area code. Calls that are currently considered local for billing purposes will continue to be billed as local calls. Existing seven-digit phone numbers will not change but will require the 406 area code to connect. Three-digit dialing services, such as the 911 emergency number, will continue to work as a three-digit number with no need to dial an area code. Along with manually dialed calls, all services that use automated dialing will need to be updated to include 10-digit phone numbers. The 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will be available beginning July 16, 2022.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police are investigating after downtown pedestrians were forced to dodge deck chairs, tables and bricks thrown from a rooftop. The Omaha World-Herald reports the incident happened Saturday night when items were thrown from the roof of the nine-story Old Market Lofts apartments. Omaha resident Lisa Brauer told the newspaper she was nearly struck by several objects. Brauer, who works for Park Omaha, was checking parking meters when she was nearly hit by a rock. That was followed by a metal table, a metal chair and a grill rack, all landing within inches of her. A police report said a pickup truck was hit by something and sustained $2,000 in damage. No arrests have been made.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Two historic locomotives that were part of the pioneering shift from steam-powered to diesel-electric trains in the mid-1900s are coming back to their home in a northeast Nevada railyard. Built in 1951, Locomotive 201 is the last survivor among 38 experimental models manufactured by the American Locomotive Company. It is scheduled to be loaded onto a truck Nov. 2 at the Northwest Railway Museum in Snoqualmie, Washington, where it still sometimes pulls excursion trains on the museum’s Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. The truck hauling the 286,000-pound engine will take four or five days at a top speed of about 35 mph to make the 900-mile trip back to Ely at the Nevada Northern Railway Museum near the Nevada-Utah line, railway President Mark Bassett said. Details are still pending for the return from Delta, Utah, of the No. 401, the first special-duty model General Motors built in 1952 in its Electro-Motive Division. It was the only one painted in the “Desert War Bonnet” scheme, a cream, scarlet and black design that remains on it today. It became known as the “Last Empress of Ely.” “These both are one-of-a-kind locomotives,” Bassett said. “Both have a story to tell, and they are both tied into the early days of dieselization of the Nevada Northern Railway.” The museum plans to restore each and eventually return them to operation for tour rides.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: For the first time, New Hampshire’s only state-run psychiatric treatment facility has negotiated contracts with all major insurance carriers in the state. Carriers now under contract with New Hampshire Hospital include Aetna, Ambetter, Anthem, Cigna, Harvard Pilgrim and United Health Care, state officials said. “Over the past few years, we have made significant strides to rebuild New Hampshire’s mental health system, and those critical efforts will continue,” Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. “Having insurer contracts in place is an important step and will help alleviate the financial uncertainty that has been a challenge for patients at New Hampshire Hospital for decades.” Previously, special case agreements were negotiated on a patient-by-patient basis. However, some care was uncompensated. The practice of New Hampshire Hospital is to accept all patients regardless of insurance coverage. New Hampshire Hospital is currently the only inpatient institute for adults with serious mental illnesses in the state.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: No one understands the stress a nurse faces on the job better than another nurse. And nothing has caused more stress for nurses than the COVID pandemic, as front-line caregivers guard against exposure to the coronavirus, witness patient deaths, and worry about family members and friends becoming infected. A confidential mental health help line, staffed by current and retired nurses, was launched Monday for nurses and their family members in the state. The Nurse2Nurse help line – at 844-687-7301 – is based at Rutgers Behavioral Health Services and available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. “It’s in our hearts to help the healers,” said Barbara Brilliantine, one of the nurses staffing the help line. “We’ve walked in their shoes.” The counselors include active and retired nurses who receive training in reciprocal peer support and wellness principles and are mental health and peer support specialists. Services are also available through virtual support groups, wellness webinars and other resources at nurse2nursenj.com. Information provided on the calls is confidential, the sponsors say. The website says the project is not affiliated with any health care system or nursing organization, and no information from the calls will be shared with employers, co-workers or peers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The final price tag for a settlement reached by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a former campaign spokesman to settle accusations of harassment is now $150,000. The latest round of payments was disclosed in a mandatory campaign finance report that the Democrat’s campaign filed Monday. The twice-annual report on spending and contributions shows the incumbent has raised $2.5 million since April for her reelection bid as several Republicans are vying to take back the office. GOP state Rep. Rebecca Dow raised more than $440,500 since announcing her candidacy in early July. Her campaign said she has received contributions from more than 1,300 donors. In the settlement involving Lujan Grisham, former campaign staffer James Hallinan had accused Lujan Grisham of dropping water on his crotch and then grabbing his crotch in the midst of a campaign staff meeting prior to the election – accusations that the governor denies. Lujan Grisham said earlier this year that she decided to resolve the matter because she wanted to focus her attention on the pandemic. At the time, the governor said there hadn’t been any other financial settlements and nondisclosure agreements of a similar nature.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recreational marijuana legalization is moving into a new phase. After stifling staff delays brought on by political infighting, newly minted members of the state Cannabis Control Board are now interpreting and shaping the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the cannabis law approved by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers last spring. Much of what the redefined medical cannabis program and the implementation of the potentially lucrative legal market will look like in the Empire State is in the purview of the five-person panel, which had its first meeting last week. The board must do that work while putting particular emphasis on social equity and repairing the harms done during the substance’s prohibition. Already, language in the law has legalized possession of 3 ounces of cannabis for people 21 and over. However, some of the regulations for localities, as well as the licensing process and social equity provisions, have yet to materialize. Kristin Jordan of Park Jordan, a commercial real estate brokerage and cannabis industry advisory firm, said the cannabis regulators don’t have a model in other states in how to legalize while accentuating social equity. “So I think more than anything we’ve got a roadmap of what didn’t work,” said Jordan, the firm’s founder and CEO.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is facing calls to resign from elected officials and LGBTQ advocacy groups over comments he made criticizing sexual education and likening gay and transgender people to “filth.” “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth,” Robinson said at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove. The state’s highest Republican executive officeholder, already the focus of criticism for trying to influence how racism can be discussed in public schools, is getting more pushback since Right Wing Watch, a project of the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, posted the video on social media last week. The Human Rights Campaign, Equality North Carolina, prominent Democratic lawmakers and the White House have condemned the remarks, with some demanding the lieutenant governor’s resignation. In a video posted on his Facebook page Saturday, Robinson narrated over images depicting gay sex that were taken from “Gender Queer,” an illustrated book he claimed “is currently in North Carolina schools,” though it wasn’t mentioned in the 831-page report he released in August highlighting cases of alleged “indoctrination.” In 2017, Robinson wrote: “You CAN NOT love God and support the homosexual agenda.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials are urging people to keep an eye out for migrating whooping cranes. The North Dakota Fish and Game Department says a portion of a population of 500 cranes is crossing the state on a 2,500-mile migration from nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada to wintering grounds in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. The agency says anyone who spots cranes should leave them alone but record the date, time and location along with the birds’ activities and report the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The reports help biologists locate crane habitat areas, monitor marked birds, and determine population numbers and migration routes.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: Thanks to a long-forgotten state law from 1953 and a community dinner, the city has challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. census. The results of last year’s count had downgraded the Athens County community from a city to a village after counting 4,612 residents – a 780-person drop from the 2010 census. Under Ohio law, the 5,000-resident level demarcates the difference between a city and a village. “We knew it was wrong,” City Auditor Taylor Sappington said. On Tuesday morning, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose agreed, restoring Nelsonville’s city status. Sappington set out to prove the city’s case by collecting census information and signatures from the town’s 5,373 residents. After a preliminary federal census report demotes a city to a village, state law gives a city auditor the authority to conduct a re-enumeration if the municipality’s governing body passes a resolution directing the auditor to do so, according to a statute in the Ohio Revised Code. After the City Council took that action, Sappington appointed five enumerators, who canvassed each block of Nelsonville over 10 days. Last week, volunteers served ham, green beans, cheesy potatoes, salad and rolls donated by Texas Roadhouse at a free community dinner where residents could come down to the town square to be counted, Sappington told council members Monday night. “I’m so proud of this community,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city and Tulsa County have each announced they will officially recognize Juneteenth as a holiday. June 19 will be an additional paid holiday for city and county employees beginning in 2022. June 19, 1865, is the day Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas – some 21/ 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves in Southern states. “Juneteenth is an important day in our country’s history, and I’m glad we are able to celebrate freedom for all Americans in this way by joining Tulsa County in adding Juneteenth to our official holiday schedule,” Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement Monday announcing the holiday. A 1921 massacre in Tulsa left an estimated 300 Black people dead at the hands of white mobs. Then-President Donald Trump scheduled his first campaign rally amid the coronavirus pandemic for June 19, 2020, in Tulsa but later rescheduled the rally for the following day amid widespread criticism from Black leaders. In June, President Joe Biden signed legislation officially recognizing the day as a federal holiday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Former Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno and three other Republicans have filed a lawsuit to challenge new congressional districts recently passed by state lawmakers. They say the new maps are partisan gerrymandering, unconstitutional and contrary to state law. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the suit, filed Monday in Marion County Circuit Court, is the first such attempt to alter the six-district map that Democrats pushed through during a contentious special legislative session last month. That session nearly ended in a Republican walkout after House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, reneged on a deal to grant the GOP an equal say in new congressional and legislative maps. Instead, Republican lawmakers showed up on the last possible day and allowed Democrats to pass a map that could lead to Democratic control of five of the state’s now-six seats in Congress. Oregon picked up an additional U.S. House seat because of population gains recorded by the recent U.S. census. The suit notes that four of the state’s six new congressional districts include part of the Portland metro area, which the Republicans say is a sign Democrats improperly stocked the districts with left-leaning voters. They have asked the court to block the plan and draw its own.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Total enrollment at Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities has declined to the lowest level in decades, according to data released Monday. The State System of Higher Education figures indicate loss of another 5,000-plus students this fall, dropping the universities’ total enrollment below 89,000 students – a level not seen in more than three decades, dating nearly to the system’s founding, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. PennLive.com reports the percentage drop in enrollment was the highest in well over two decades. System officials earlier warned state lawmakers and others that the 2021-22 year would be a “very challenging” one for enrollment, citing factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The system, founded in 1983, saw its enrollment peak at about 119,500 students in 2010 but saw the total drop to 94,000 last year. A review of system data indicates that the current total below 89,000 is lower than in any year since 1989, the Post-Gazette reports. Chancellor Dan Greenstein said the drop likely stems from the pandemic finally catching up with the system, which had avoided the declines other institutions saw last year. He said anecdotal accounts point to the pandemic’s impact on family incomes and students taking advantage of $15 and $20 per hour wages some firms are offering.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza wants to spend up to $1.6 million in federal coronavirus relief funding to establish nonviolence training and youth mentorship programs to address an increase in violence in the city. Providence recently opened requests for proposals for both initiatives, planning to allocate up to $500,000 in American Rescue Plan funds for training and up to $1.1 million for mentorship. Elorza said the idea began taking shape in May when nine people were injured in a shooting. “I reached out to some community leaders, sort of on the front line of things, and I asked them to put me in contact with families, mothers who had lost children, people who were either on parole or on probation, but were trying to turn their life around, and other folks who are on the front lines of living and working with these issues,” Elorza said. It became clear that the city was in need of more opportunities for youth, he said. There have been 20 homicides in the city this year. The five-year average for this point in the year is 11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair returns Wednesday after a hiatus brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year’s event was drive-thru only due to a high number of COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Department of Health and Environmental Control officials reported that such cases have dropped below 1,000 for the first time since July. More than 50% of South Carolinians are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the virus. State fair officials have instituted new protocols to prevent the virus’s spread, including increased cleaning, hygiene signage, hand sanitizer stations and reminding guests that in Columbia they must wear a face covering, WIS-TV reports. Guests are also encouraged to socially distance, use card and touchless methods for payments, and not come to the fair if they aren’t feeling well. The event, which runs through Oct. 24, includes rides, food, agriculture and livestock shows, crafts, art and a cookie kitchen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers redrawing the state’s political boundaries kicked off a three-day tour of public input meetings Monday amid intraparty Republican bickering and competing proposals for new legislative districts. The House and Senate committees, both dominated by Republicans, had previously sought accord in the once-in-a-decade process. But at a public input meeting in Box Elder, the schism between the House and Senate was on full display during the tour, dubbed “the redistricting roadshow” by lawmakers. The Legislature will convene Nov. 8 to consider new political boundaries, which must also be approved by Gov. Kristi Noem. If they can’t reach a consensus by Dec. 1, redistricting would be determined by the state Supreme Court. As Republicans accused each other of gerrymandering and “D.C. political tactics,” members of Native American communities used the meetings to press for greater representation in the Legislature. At the first meeting Monday, advocates pushed for compact political boundaries around northern Rapid City, which has a large number of Native Americans, that would allow the community to elect someone who represents its interests. The lawmakers are making seven stops this week, culminating with two meetings in Sioux Falls on Wednesday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday slightly tweaked his order requiring Knox County schools to implement a school mask mandate, saying officials would be allowed to approve exemptions on a case-by-case basis. In his 14-page ruling, however, U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer warned school officials – who had previously refused to adopt a mask mandate amid the COVID-19 outbreak – that the new mask exemption policy must not be abused. “The court reminds the Knox County Board of Education that its school system is no longer under a voluntary mask mandate; rather, it is under a court-ordered mask mandate,” Greer wrote. “The record evidence supports the need for – and the court ordered – a universal mask mandate, and the court fully expects its mask mandate to be exactly that: universal, to every possible extent, with ‘very few’ medical exemptions.” The Knox County Board of Education must file monthly status reports that identify not only the number of exemptions for students, employees and visitors but also the specific reasons for the exemptions. Greer said he would impose “considerable sanctions” if the education board did not comply with his latest order.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state’s child welfare agency is being accused of removing a webpage that provided information about a suicide prevention hotline and other resources for young LGBTQ people, following criticism by one of Gov. Greg Abbott’s primary challengers. The Houston Chronicle reports Abbott challenger Don Huffines posted a video on Twitter in August accusing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services of “promoting transgender sexual policies to Texas youth.” Within hours of the video being posted, the webpage was removed. The page appeared in a section of the agency’s website called “Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation.” Also gone was the entire website for the Texas Youth Connection, a division of Family and Protective Services that steers young people in foster care to various resources, including education, housing and those on its LGBTQ page. “These are not Texas values, these are not Republican Party values, but these are obviously Greg Abbott’s values,” Huffines said in his video. Abbott, who appoints the department’s commissioner and nine-member council, didn’t respond to the newspaper’s request for comment. Agency communications obtained through a public records request show that employees discussed removing the page in response to Huffines’ tweet.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Lawyers for Gov. Spencer Cox’s former campaign manager, who resigned last week after an investigation substantiated claims of sexual misconduct made against him by a female campaign employee, are calling the accusations baseless. In a statement Friday, lawyers representing Austin Cox said the relationship in question was a long-term one between two young adults that he ended earlier this year, KUTV reports. “Our client unequivocally and emphatically denies any allegations to the contrary,” the statement said. The Republican governor said Thursday that an independent investigation found cause to terminate Austin Cox, his 2020 campaign manager, but he resigned before its completion. The investigation also revealed previously unreported “hostile conduct” toward other members of the team. Austin Cox’s attorneys on Friday additionally criticized a joint statement from the governor and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson on Thursday that condemned the former campaign manager’s behavior. KUTV requested to speak with Austin Cox on Friday, but his attorney declined their request for an interview. The governor and former campaign manager are not related.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: An Abraham Lincoln statue at a museum was vandalized with the number “38,” which police say they believe is a reference to the execution of 38 Native Americans ordered by the former president in 1862. Police said an employee at the Bennington Museum arrived Sunday morning to find a large “LAND BACK” banner had been put up between two light poles at the entrance to the museum’s courtyard. The Lincoln statue in the courtyard had reddish spray paint on its face and hands, along with the number “38” painted on its chest, police said. Officials said it is expected to cost several thousand dollars to repair the statue and remove the paint. Police said they believe the vandalism is a reference to the Dakota 38, who were executed after the 1862 Dakota War, also known as the Sioux Uprising of 1862. A military commission sentenced 303 Sioux fighters to be executed. Lincoln reviewed the cases and decided there was evidence that 39 Sioux were guilty of murder or rape during the uprising and ordered their execution. The remaining 264 sentences were commuted. One of those sentenced to be executed received a reprieve. The Bennington Museum describes itself as a museum of art, history and innovation.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Former President Barack Obama will campaign with fellow Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the final stretch of the gubernatorial race. “The stakes could not be greater,” McAuliffe said as he announced the news Tuesday morning on MSNBC. McAuliffe’s race against the GOP nominee, first-time political candidate Glenn Youngkin, is tightening, according to the latest polls. His effort to win a second, nonconsecutive term in office is one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races in the country this year and is being closely watched for indications of voter sentiment ahead of next year’s midterms. McAuliffe’s campaign announced that Obama will join him in Richmond on Oct. 23 to mobilize Virginians during early voting, which began weeks ago and runs in person through Oct. 30. Obama rallied Democrats in Virginia’s capital city in 2017 before Ralph Northam beat Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie by nearly 9 percentage points. He’ll follow other high-profile Democrats visiting the commonwealth to support McAuliffe. First lady Jill Biden is set to visit on Friday. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist, grassroots organizer and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, will campaign with McAuliffe in Norfolk and northern Virginia on Sunday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Rewards totaling $2.5 million are now being offered for information that helps solve the killing of federal prosecutor Thomas C. Wales in Seattle 20 years ago. Nicholas Brown, newly sworn in as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington, announced Monday at a ceremony marking the anniversary of Wales’ death that the Justice Department had doubled its reward to $2 million, in addition to about $500,000 being offered by the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys. Brown also said his office – long recused from the case – is taking on leadership of the investigation, as there are few remaining assistant U.S. attorneys in Seattle who worked with Wales. The investigation had been overseen by a special prosecutor in New York, Steve Clymer; transferring the oversight to Seattle will allow for fresh eyes and additional resources, Brown said. “Twenty years is far too long for this crime – this attack on the American justice system – to go unresolved,” Brown said. Wales was an 18-year veteran of the U.S. attorney’s office who focused on white-collar crime and also served as president of a gun-control group called Washington CeaseFire.

West Virginia lost one of its three U.S. House seats after the 2020 census, and lawmakers are trying to redraw the state into two congressional districts. In the proposed map, Rep. David McKinley and Rep. Alex Mooney would be in the same district. All three current U.S. House members from West Virginia are Republicans. The state Senate redistricting committee forwarded its versions of congressional and state Senate maps Monday. Earlier in the day, a map that reconfigures all 100 House of Delegates seats into separate, single-member districts was endorsed by a House committee. The maps now go before the committees’ respective full chambers. The congressional redistricting map endorsed by the House committee would split the state roughly into north and south sections. The 1st District would include both panhandles and much of the northern part of the state along with Wood County on the western edge. The 2nd District would include the southern coalfields and the Greenbrier Valley, extending north into Ritchie County.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s Democratic attorney general, who represents the state elections commission, on Monday called for a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election to be shut down, saying it is a partisan political effort that lacks credibility, wastes taxpayer money and is not serious. “This investigation suffers from glaring flaws that destroy any credibility its results could have had,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said at a news conference. “Shut this fake investigation down.” Kaul’s comments came after the Republican leader of the Assembly election committee said she’s been kept out of the loop and doesn’t agree with moves being made by the leader of the probe. The latest twists comes after Michael Gableman, the retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading the investigation, issued a video over the weekend taking aim at Gov. Tony Evers. The Democratic governor told local election officials they should be “lawyered up” and called the taxpayer-funded investigation a “$700,000 boondoggle.” Gableman called that “an incomplete and misguided view” of the probe. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ordered the investigation under pressure from Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Rapper, music producer and clothing entrepreneur Kanye West has put his ranch and business properties in northwestern Wyoming up for sale. The West Ranch, formerly known as Monster Lake Ranch, went on the market Monday for $11 million. The property sprawls across 6 square miles of open land and tree-studded hills and outcrops about 6 miles south of Cody. The property features lakes, a lodge, a commercial kitchen, equipment sheds, a horse facility, corrals and a go-kart track, according to the DBW Realty listing. The listing came days after West listed his seven commercial properties in Cody for more than $3.2 million, the Cody Enterprise reports. The ranch, which leases additional land owned by the U.S. government, was listed for $13.3 million before West bought it in 2019, though it’s unknown how much he paid for the property. Wyoming law does not provide for public disclosure of real estate sale amounts. West moved from California to Wyoming in 2019 and set about basing at least some of his clothing business in Cody, a city of about 10,000 on the eastern approach to Yellowstone National Park. It wasn’t clear if the property sales mean West is leaving Wyoming or just reorganizing his business there.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/21/slavery-reckonings-radio-citys-return-marijuana-movements-news-around-states/117129826/", "title": "Slavery reckonings, Radio City's return: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the white Alabama businessman who financed the voyage of the last slave ship to land in the United States more than 160 years ago have agreed to sell a building that will become a hub for Africatown USA, the community settled by the freed Africans after the Civil War. A long-closed credit union building owned by relatives of Timothy Meaher will open within weeks as a food bank and as home of the Africatown Redevelopment Corp., officials told a news conference Thursday. The family sold the brick building to the city for $50,000, well below its appraised value of $300,000. The family, which tax records show owns millions of dollars’ worth of land around Mobile, issued a statement that described selling the building as a way “to give back to the community.” Mayor Sandy Stimpson said he contacted a representative of the family about acquiring the property in Africatown, located just a few miles north of downtown Mobile. Large parts of the once-vibrant community are blighted, but the area has received new attention since the wreckage of the slave ship, Clotilda, was found in 2018. Community leaders are now trying to revitalize the area with a museum and other attractions that could bring visitors and an infusion of money into the area.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A special legislative session limped toward a bitter end Friday, with the threat of a partial government shutdown looming and Gov. Mike Dunleavy and House majority leaders sharply disagreeing over the adequacy of the budget passed by lawmakers last week. Dunleavy called the budget “defective,” pointing in particular to the House’s failure to get the two-thirds support for a procedural effective-date vote. His office said notices were sent to thousands of state workers warning of possible layoffs with the new fiscal year beginning July 1. He called another special session, set to begin Wednesday and again focus on the budget, shortly after the House held a brief floor session for which attendance was not mandatory Friday afternoon. House majority leaders were among those who criticized Dunleavy’s stance on the budget. House Speaker Louise Stutes characterized it as a needless choice and said Dunleavy has tools available to prevent shutting down parts of the government, including asking minority Republicans to change their votes to support the effective-date clause. Minority Republicans, who say they have felt marginalized and want to be included in talks on what pieces should be considered as part of a broader fiscal plan, take responsibility for their votes, House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Researchers at the University of Arizona will be launching a study of how prone Hispanic children are to asthma in Tucson compared with their peers on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Sonora. The study will follow 500 pregnant women of Mexican descent in both cities and their newborns for the next five years to see how prevalent asthma is. Dr. Fernando Martinez, a principal investigator of the project and director of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, said there is four times less asthma in Nogales, Sonora, than in Tucson, which is about an hour’s drive away. A study of teenagers in Nogales, Arizona, showed 16% had asthma compared with 4% to 6% of teens in the same age range just across the border in Nogales, Sonora. Mexicans who come to the United States also have less asthma than Mexican Americans, researchers have found. The Arizona Daily Star reports the University of Arizona study will look into how the risk of asthma is affected by the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that a child’s reduced exposure to germs stunts the immune system’s ability to fight infectious organisms. The study was delayed due to COVID-19, but researchers plan to begin enrolling pregnant women in August and finish by August 2023.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge Friday refused to allow a man arrested after he was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot to travel for a classic-car swap meet. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper rejected the request by Richard Barnett to loosen the 50-mile restriction on how far he can travel from his residence while he’s on home detention awaiting trial. Barnett’s attorney said the Gravette, Arkansas, man needed to be able to travel to make a living buying and selling classic cars. Petit Jean Mountain, where the car show was being held over the weekend, is 200 miles from Gravette. “The Court is not persuaded that the defendant cannot pursue gainful employment within a 50-mile radius of his home as permitted by the current conditions,” Cooper’s order said. Barnett, 61, was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol as lawmakers assembled to certify Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Prosecutors say Barnett was carrying a stun gun when he entered the building. Federal prosecutors opposed Barnett’s request and said his conduct while awaiting trial – including an interview with Russian State Television – indicated more conditions, not fewer, were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Attorney General Rob Bonta launched new anti-human trafficking teams to apprehend perpetrators and support survivors Friday amid an alarming increase in labor and sexual exploitation statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic. California’s lockdown exacerbated problems with human trafficking, officials said Friday, and made it much harder for victims to escape and find housing and other services. Kay Buck, the chief executive officer for Los Angeles-based nonprofit Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, called it “the most unforgettable and heart-wrenching year” as advocates saw a huge demand in services combined with a shortage of resources. In LA alone, the nonprofit saw a spike of 185% in urgent human trafficking cases during the pandemic, Buck said. Advocates in LA County see victims – many who come from Mexico and the Philippines – who were duped into thinking they would have a job in the U.S. but are instead sold into “modern-day slavery.” Actors and activists Mira Sorvino and Alyssa Milano; state Assemblyman Miguel Santiago; and Angela Guanzon, who escaped her trafficker and aided law enforcement in their prosecution, joined Bonta on Friday to implore Newsom and lawmakers to approve another $30 million in new grants over the next three years, doubling the funding level for the efforts.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited a mobile vaccine clinic near the city Friday to promote COVID-19 shots among underserved communities of color that have some of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. He also met with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, getting briefly interrupted by the governor’s dog, Gia, and another dog dashing through their closed-door session, giving the two a laugh. They discussed the state’s pandemic response and a new law creating a state-administered health insurance plan designed to reduce premiums and costs of care as well as get more people covered. Later, Becerra, the agency’s first Latino leader, and Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation toured a mobile vaccine clinic focused on underserved communities in the Denver suburb of Aurora, which is nearly 30% Hispanic. It’s one of nine mobile units made from converted buses. While Hispanic people make up 20% of Colorado’s population, less than 10% have been vaccinated, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow said many minorities and immigrants have trouble finding the time to get vaccinated while working multiple jobs, highlighting the need for the mobile resources. “Where you are, we will go. Donde tú estás, iremos nosotros,” Becerra said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has become the first in the nation to make all prison phone calls free, addressing one of the biggest emotional and financial burdens faced by incarcerated men and women and their families as they try to stay in touch. The state has a prison contract with phone vendor Securus Technologies, which charges up to $5 for a 15-minute call – some of the highest phone rates in the country. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill into law Wednesday that allows incarcerated men, women and juveniles a minimum of 90 minutes a day of free calls. Supports said the change could go into effect as early as next month. “We’re on the right side of history,” said Democratic state Rep. Josh Elliott, one of the legislation’s supporters. “Corporations can no longer be allowed to exploit the love between incarcerated people and their families – not in our state, not on our watch.” Several more local jurisdictions in the U.S. have also taken steps to make prison and jail phone calls free, including New York City, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. “This historic legislation will change lives,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which has been working with local advocates to slash prison phone costs. “It will keep food on the table for struggling families, children in contact with their parents, and our communities safer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden announced Saturday that Champ, the older of the family’s two dogs, had died “peacefully at home.” The German shepherd was 13. “He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family,” Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement posted to the president’s official Twitter account. The Bidens, who were spending the weekend at their home in Wilmington, got Champ from a breeder after Joe Biden was elected vice president in 2008. Champ was a fixture both at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory and at the White House. In their statement, the Bidens said when Champ was young, “he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory,” and more recently he enjoyed “joining us as a comforting presence in meetings or sunning himself in the White House garden.” “In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion,” the Bidens said. Champ’s passing leaves the Bidens with their younger German shepherd, Major, whom the family adopted from the Delaware Humane Society in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents getting their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at select sites through the end of July will receive $51 gift cards and be entered for a chance to win free flights and other incentives, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Washington has reached 70% of adults having received at least one dose. While anyone can get a COVID-19 shot at district vaccination sites, the gift cards are only available to D.C. residents. Those between the ages of 12 and 17 must be accompanied by a guardian. Residents will receive the gift card after getting their shot. Additionally, Washingtonians getting their shots at Anacostia High School, Ron Brown High School or RISE Demonstration Center will be entered to win two round-trip American Airlines tickets to anywhere the airline flies, including international locations. Other prizes offered in a series of drawings starting Saturday include a new car, a year’s worth of groceries, and a one-year Metro pass. More information about the giveaways can be found at coronavirus.dc.gov/incentives. A full schedule of the days and hours of the current walk-up sites can be found at taketheshotdc.com.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A federal judge on Friday ruled for the state in a lawsuit challenging a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order making it difficult for cruise ships to resume sailing due to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday wrote in a 124-page decision that Florida would be harmed if the CDC order, which the state said effectively blocked most cruises, were to continue. The Tampa-based judge granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the CDC from enforcing the order pending further legal action on a broader lawsuit. “This order finds that Florida is highly likely to prevail on the merits of the claim that CDC’s conditional sailing order and the implementing orders exceed the authority delegated to the CDC,” Merryday wrote. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody praised the decision in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a victory for the hardworking Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the cruise industry,” said Moody, a Republican. “The federal government does not, nor should it ever, have the authority to single out and lock down an entire industry indefinitely.” While the CDC could appeal, Merryday ordered both sides to return to mediation to attempt to work out a full solution – a previous attempt failed – and said the CDC could fashion a modification in which it would retain some public health authority.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia’s secretary of state is making public a list of nearly 102,000 voters who will be removed from the rolls unless they act to preserve their registration. Republican Brad Raffensperger announced the list Friday, part of an every-other-year bid to remove voters who may have died or moved away. The state has about 7.8 million voters, and his office said the removals include about 67,000 voters who submitted a change-of-address form to the U.S. Postal Service, plus about 34,000 voters who had election mail returned. Voter purges in Georgia became a hot-button issue during the 2018 governor’s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. As secretary of state before being elected governor, Kemp oversaw aggressive voter purges during his tenure. More than 1.4 million voter registrations were canceled in Georgia between 2012 and 2018. In the current purge, election officials said, cancellation notices will be mailed, and those who respond within 40 days will have their registration switched back to active. Anyone who is removed could register again. On a monthly basis, the secretary of state been removing voters who were convicted of felonies or who died.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton is condemning the Honolulu Police Department for the fatal shooting of a Black man as various versions of what led to the death continue to emerge. “Lindani Myeni’s killing is yet another sensational racialization and criminalization of an innocent, unarmed black man at the hands of police not following the law and proper police procedures,” Sharpton said in a statement Thursday. Interim Honolulu Police Chief Rade Vanic said the police department is committed to public service, and these “are challenging times for police departments everywhere.” Sharpton weighed in on the April 14 shooting of Myeni after lawyers representing his widow in a wrongful-death lawsuit made public last week a doorbell video showing the 29-year-old arriving at a house, taking off his shoes and quickly leaving after his presence confused the occupants. Myeni repeatedly apologized to the couple. The lawsuit said he likely mistook the home for a temple next door that’s open to the public. Police responding to a 911 call shot him a short time later outside the house, with body camera footage showing an officer fired several gunshots before saying, “Police!” An attorney representing the homeowner and the tourists who were staying in the house said Myeni’s presence wasn’t as innocuous as lawyers for his wife portrayed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is suing Gov. Brad Little and state wildlife officials in federal court, contending Idaho has wrongly denied the tribe hunting rights guaranteed by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Bridger. The lawsuit, filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court last week, asks a judge to declare that the Northwestern Band is protected under the treaty. On its surface, the legal case could come down to whether one of the Native American leaders who signed the treaty was representing the Northwestern Band along with other bands of the Shoshone Nation and whether the Northwestern Band itself has remained a cohesive unit in the time since. But at the heart of the dispute is a dilemma faced by many Native American governments across the U.S. who sometimes find themselves at odds with game wardens, mining companies, water users or other groups as they try to preserve their use of the land they were promised in treaties signed centuries ago. Some Northwestern Band tribal members have faced criminal convictions after Idaho game wardens said they were hunting without tags. In 1997, two brothers were found guilty for hunting out of season in Idaho, though they had hunting tags issued by the Northwestern Band. Shane and Wayde Warner appealed their convictions, claiming rights under the Fort Bridger treaty.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is dangling millions of dollars in cash prizes and scholarships to encourage residents to get vaccinated, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday. Illinois will offer $7 million in cash prizes and $3 million in scholarships through a new lottery open to all residents who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Pritzker made the announcement at a community health center in Chicago’s Back of Yards neighborhood. Prizes will range from $100,000 to $1 million, and children can win a college savings plan worth $150,000. Names in Illinois’ vaccination database will be automatically eligible for the lottery. Participants will be required to have a shot by July 1. Weekly drawings will begin July 8. “ ‘All In For The Win’ is yet another way we’re working to ensure every single resident is protected from COVID-19,” Pritzker said. Nearly 67% of Illinois’ residents have received at least one vaccination dose, and a little over 50% have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A grain mill that opened more than 180 years ago in northern Indiana saw a sales boom during the pandemic after it opened a drive-thru for customers eager to buy freshly milled grains. The historic Bonneyville Mill was closed to visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, like many Indiana businesses. But staff at the 1830s mill converted its original horse and wagon bay that farmers once used to deliver freshly harvested grain into a drive-thru for automobiles, which helped the mill along the Little Elkhart River rack up its most profitable year on record for grain sales, said Ronda DeCaire, director of the Elkhart County Parks system. “This was one of the few places in the Midwest where you could still buy flour and other freshly milled grains,” she told The Elkhart Truth. To prevent spreading the coronavirus, the mill’s staff used a pole with a bucket on its end to accept payments from drive-thru customers. Packages of flour and other milled grains were then handed to those customers through their car windows. “For the first time in over a hundred years, that wagon bay was busy again,” said Courtney Franke, the mill’s manager. DeCaire said the Bonneyville Mill is the oldest continuously operating grist mill in Indiana. It’s located just south of the Michigan border about 25 miles east of South Bend.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A divided state Supreme Court on Friday banned police from searching people’s uncollected trash without a warrant, outlawing an investigative technique that had been used for decades. The court ruled 4-3 that officers commit an unreasonable search and seizure under the Iowa Constitution when they look for evidence of crimes in trash left for collection outside homes. The tactic amounts to an unconstitutional trespass on private property and violates citizens’ expectations of privacy, especially in cities that have ordinances barring residents from accessing others’ trash, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote for the majority. “We do not question the utility of warrantless trash grabs for the purposes of law enforcement, but the utility of warrantless activity is not the issue under our constitution,” he wrote, adding that “garbage contains intimate and private details of life.” The ruling overturned Iowa courts’ long adherence to a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the search of garbage outside one’s home. Just a small number of other states have limited trash searches by holding that their state constitutions provide greater protections than the U.S. Constitution against warrantless searches.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: A judge is beginning to evict tenants who are behind on rent in advance of the expiration of a federal moratorium that some experts predict will bring a tide of people being forced from homes nationwide. Johnson County Magistrate Judge Daniel Vokins said during a Zoom eviction hearing last week that he doesn’t think the moratorium, which was issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and expires at the end of the month, is enforceable. Eric Dunn, director of litigation for the National Housing Law Project, said he has heard of judges elsewhere – including in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina – ignoring the CDC moratorium but couldn’t say whether it’s been a widespread practice. The federal moratorium has kept many tenants owing back rent housed. More than 4 million people nationally say they fear being evicted or foreclosed upon in the months following its expiration, census data shows. Making matters worse, the tens of billions of dollars in federal emergency rental assistance that was supposed to solve the problem has not reached most tenants. “We thought 2021 was going to be better, and it is turning out to be just as bad,” said Denise Wall, 31, of the Kansas City suburb of Shawnee, who applied for rental aid in March but is still trying to find out whether she qualifies.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: With tourists flocking to distilleries, concerns about a pandemic hangover for the state’s world-famous bourbon industry are quickly evaporating. A $19 million tourist center that Heaven Hill Distillery opened just days ago in the heart of the state’s bourbon country is already overflowing, with reservations filling up quickly to learn about whiskey-making and sample its spirits, including its flagship Evan Williams whiskey. It’s a similar story for the numerous other distilleries in the region that last spring were temporarily closed to visitors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year later, the businesses are facing such overwhelming demand for tours that one industry official has started encouraging people to call ahead or check tour availability online before pulling off the highway. Starting last summer, some distilleries began allowing limited numbers of visitors in accordance with coronavirus restrictions. With capacity limits now lifted, the attractions are gearing up for a full resurgence of guests, many from outside Kentucky. “We saw it coming, but I don’t think we saw it coming this quick,” said Kentucky Distillers’ Association President Eric Gregory, who predicted bourbon tourism will quickly rebound to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The iconic bald cypress trees will be protected on state-owned property, after Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a new law banning the trees’ harvesting on more than 1million acres of state land. Rep. Neil Riser said he sponsored the bill – which won unanimous passage in the state House and Senate – to give nature time to reestablish dense stands of cypress that once covered vast tracts of land. “The cypress tree symbolizes Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta,” said Riser, R-Columbia. “I hope this new law will help people have a true appreciation of these trees’ majesty.” The new law doesn’t apply to cypress trees growing on privately owned land. Cypress trees grow throughout Louisiana’s swamps and can have lifespans of more than 1,000 years. The bald cypress was named the official Louisiana state tree in 1963. Riser said the forests will return on state-owned lands with protection, though it will take almost a century for the slow-growth trees to mature. “They will come back with Mother Nature as the manager and forester,” he said. In a twist, Riser was involved in harvesting the trees as a teenage logger in the 1970s when forests were being cleared for farmland. “I remember my dad telling me, ‘Take a look at this forest; one day it will all be gone,’ and it was,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature has approved an initial proposal that would allow four Native American tribes to build gambling businesses on their lands, in a reversal from years of resistance and laws that opposed Native ownership of casinos in the state. Breaking years of opposition against the bill, the House and Senate approved it with an overwhelming majority Thursday, the Portland Press Herald reports. Rep. Rena Newell, a nonvoting member of the Legislature who represents the Passamaquoddy Tribe, gave a speech following the approval of the bill, which she had pushed legislators to advance. The bill was only a small part of what the state could do for the tribes in Maine, she said. “Our ancestors watched from inside the bounds of our reservation as nontribal members got rich from cutting down our trees on our land, leaving us with little,” Newell said. The gambling legislation is one part of a series of changes the Legislature wants to amend the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. If these amendments are enacted, the revisions would restore some of the sovereignty that tribal leaders say they lost years ago, according to the Press Herald. Maine voters have rejected tribes’ past proposals but approved referendum questions that led to the establishment of two corporate-owned casinos.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is awarding $10million to entertainment venues that struggled during the pandemic, including the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Maryland Theatre and the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, among others. The money will help stabilize businesses that had to shut down or drastically reduce their capacity as COVID-19 surged. As the state begins to emerge from the pandemic, the money will also help venues prepare for the busier fall arts season, said Nicholas Cohen, the executive director of Maryland Citizens for the Arts. “The arts season is a little quiet in the summer. It comes back in the fall,” Cohen said. “What this does is it helps float these venues until then, to really be like, ‘Here we are; we’re back; we’re maybe close to full capacity.’ ” The additional $10 million in state grants will go to more than 60 venues and organizations. For the nearly century-old Potomac Playmakers, the money will help maintain the nonprofit’s new home, which volunteer grant writer Greg Berezuk said the group moved into just before the pandemic shut everything down. “We got in there just before COVID. It’s a wonderful facility for an audience to enjoy a live performance, and we couldn’t use it,” Berezuk said. Fixed costs, such as the mortgage and utilities, had to be paid even without shows, he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A union that represents about 800 city employees who have been working remotely during the pandemic has filed an unfair labor practices claim against acting Mayor Kim Janey’s administration for unilaterally ordering them back to the office. The Service Employees International Union Local 888 filed the complaint with the state Thursday, the Boston Herald reports. “The City refused in good faith to bargain about health and safety issues, family and childcare issues (especially single and low wage employees), and productivity issues (as the evidence will show that many of the job tasks have been accomplished at a higher rate due to the use of virtual meetings and technology),” the union wrote in the complaint. Janey this month ordered remote workers back in phases in late June and early July. “The city did not explain why the return to physical work locations was necessitated on the dates picked for reopening other than they have the right to do it,” the SEIU wrote. In response to the complaint, a city spokesperson said in a statement: “Mayor Janey remains committed to flexibility, as we fully restore vital services to Boston residents. We do not have further comment at this time on the pending litigation.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People with a disability or a positive HIV test could not be discriminated against during the organ transplant process under legislation passed by the state House. Though the federal Americans with Disabilities Act bans discrimination on the basis of disability during the organ transplant process, organizations such as the National Down Syndrome Society say certain disability designations affect where a person sits on a transplant list, if they even get on a list at all. One bill passed by the House puts Michigan on the same path several states have taken, outlawing the denial of a transplant or lowering a person’s place on an organ waiting list because of their disability. However, no penalty for discrimination is listed in the bill. The other bill would allow patients with HIV to donate their organs to HIV-positive recipients. Both bills must be passed by the state Senate and signed by the governor in order to become law. Nationally, in 2013 the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act lifted a decades­long ban on transplanting HIV-infected organs into recipients. Current state law doesn’t allow Michigan residents to receive organs from individuals who test positive for HIV, so organs that test positive get shipped off to out-of-state recipients.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Staunch conservatives and advocates of legal marijuana have formed an unlikely alliance to pressure the Legislature to allow medical cannabis patients to own guns. The more than 35,000 patients in Minnesota’s program can’t own guns as the law now stands because the federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug, on par with heroin, and prohibits anyone who uses an “unlawful” substance from purchasing a firearm. So some gun-rights supporters and pro-legalization groups and legislators are lobbying during the special session to allow the Minnesota Department of Health to petition the federal government for an exemption. The change is being debated as part of the state’s public safety and health and human services budget bills. If their effort is successful, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports, Minnesota would be the first of 36 states that allow medical marijuana in some form to appeal directly to the federal government on behalf of its enrollees. The ranks of the state’s medical marijuana patients are expected to triple or quadruple over the next few years under a new law that liberalizes the state’s restrictive program to allow smokable marijuana instead of more expensive pills or liquid extracts.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The National Park Service on Friday accepted the city’s donation of land at a site that was once one of the largest slave markets in the United States. The federal agency eventually will develop exhibits that tell the history of Forks of the Road, where Black people were sold to work in slavery in Southern plantations from 1833 to 1863. The site in Natchez has had a sign and a small monument made of concrete and shackles. Officials have been working since 2005 on proposals to create a detailed memorial. More than 100 people watched Friday as the city donated nearly 3 acres to the park service in a ceremony that took place a day after President Joe Biden signed legislation to create a federal holiday for Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. on the date when enslaved people in Texas got word of the Emancipation Proclamation. “As we commemorate the celebration of liberty, Juneteenth, and we gather to remember the system of enslavement and the oppression the proceeded this freedom, we acknowledge the tragic story of what happened here at Forks of the Road and within the city of Natchez,” said Lance Hatten, deputy regional director for the National Park Service. “When that truth is told and heard, the journey to healing and unity begins.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated health officials in the area are imploring residents to get COVID-19 vaccinations as the faster-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus pushes case numbers and hospitalizations higher. Random testing of virus samples has determined that the delta variant, which is more infectious and potentially more deadly than other strains, has become dominant around Springfield and in much of southwest Missouri, said Kendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology with Greene County. Administrators at the two largest hospitals serving the state’s southwestern region – Mercy and CoxHealth – are pleading with residents to get inoculated because COVID-19 patient loads are increasing at a rate they have not previously seen during the pandemic, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. In Greene County, 36% of the population has begun the vaccination process. In most surrounding counties, the figure is below 30%. Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield, said hospitalizations averaged in the teens a month ago but reached 72 by Thursday. CoxHealth has seen similar numbers. Many of the new patients are young, healthy adults and pregnant women, he said. The delta variant “has become prevalent” across Missouri, state health officials said last week.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Wildlife officials are seeking feedback on a proposal to expand fishing restrictions to protect declining brown trout populations. Biologists with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Geological Survey have tracked declining numbers of juvenile brown trout in southwest Montana rivers, including the Big Hole, Ruby, Boulder, Beaverhead, upper Yellowstone and upper Stillwater rivers, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Eric Roberts, fish management bureau chief with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the trend is concerning because low numbers of younger fish indicate that older fish are not being replaced. Biologists are now gathering public comments on the proposed changes, which include seasonal fishing closures from September to May, catch-and-release requirements, and evening fishing restrictions from 2 p.m. to midnight daily. The changes could also apply to the rivers’ tributaries. Residents can submit comment online, by mail or by attending public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. Department officials will then develop proposals to be considered in August. Roberts attributed the trout population decline, in part, to changing water temperatures and habitat alterations. He said there are long-term plans in place to address stream flows and enhance habitat.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Amtrak trains are once again rumbling through the state capital on a daily basis. The California Zephyr, which runs from Chicago to San Francisco, has resumed its pre-pandemic schedule of one eastbound and one westbound train stopping in Lincoln in the early hours of each day. ProRail Nebraska, a group of citizens that supports the continuation of passenger train service in the state, met the westbound train at the Lincoln Amtrak station on the first day of resumed daily service, May 24. According to ProRail’s District 1 director, Richard Schmeling, ProRail opposed the pause in daily service, lobbying Nebraska’s federal representatives to support Amtrak through the pandemic. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said daily service was halted on many routes after the Senate declined to pass funding for the service during the pandemic. Now that legislation providing the funding has been passed and signed by the president, he said, Amtrak has resumed service at full capacity. “It enables us to be a better service in the 500 places we serve,” he told the Lincoln Journal Star. It also enabled Amtrak to recall more than 2,000 workers nationally that it put on furlough while service was decreased, Magliari said, including conductors, engineers and service people.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new kind of jackpot is coming to the Silver State, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday, but only for residents who’ve gotten a COVID-19 shot. The Democratic governor announced a broad effort to encourage reluctant or forgetful residents to get shots, adding his state to a growing list offering unconventional incentives to revive flatlining vaccination programs amid waning demand. Sisolak didn’t call it a lottery, instead terming the “Vax Nevada Days” prize program a raffle because entrants aren’t paying to participate, and vaccines are free. The program makes all residents who have received at least one dose of vaccine since December – along with military members and their dependents – automatically eligible to receive part of $5 million in prize money. Winners will be announced every Thursday for eight weeks beginning July 8. Students ages 12 to 17 can get college tuition credits worth $5,000 to $50,000. People 18 and up are eligible for prizes from $1,000 to $250,000. Among almost 2,000 winners, a $1 million grand prize winner will be announced Aug. 26. “If people are looking for reasons not to get vaccinated, they’re going to come up with one. I’m trying to give people 5 million reasons to get vaccinated,” Sisolak said, referencing the total cash prizes being offered.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is providing up to $1 million to encourage students to move off campus to ease a housing crunch this fall. Students can opt to have their names included in a one-time lottery for $5,000 to encourage as many as 200 returning students to live off campus, Mike Wooten, associate dean of residential life, said in an email to students who are on a housing waitlist. Dartmouth is shifting some of its larger doubles to triples and converting lounges to student rooms where possible, but that isn’t enough to alleviate the housing crunch, Wooten said in the email. “As expected, demand has exceeded our capacity,” he wrote. “Although this has been the case in prior years, interest in living on campus has understandably surged following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.” Some students said the school should be trying harder to house them – or at least better communicate why it can’t. “It hasn’t been made clear of what actions they’ve taken to mitigate this other than the lottery,” David Millman, a sophomore, told WMUR-TV.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Landlords won’t be able to inquire about potential renters’ criminal histories under a new law Gov. Phil Murphy signed Friday. The Democratic governor signed the Fair Chance in Housing Act on what was the state’s first official celebration of Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state workers. “We must commit to both remembering the past and continuing to take action to ensure communities of color, especially Black Americans, achieve the full equity they deserve,” Murphy said in a statement. He also signed legislation making the third Friday in June a state holiday. June 19 – or Juneteenth – commemorates when word reached enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, that slavery had been abolished. President Joe Biden signed similar nationwide legislation Thursday. The new housing measure aims to eliminate housing instability that contributes to recidivism, according to the governor. The new law won’t apply in cases where federal law permits landlords to ask about certain criminal convictions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday that all remaining pandemic-related public health restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activity in the state will be lifted July 1, clearing the way for restaurants and other venues to operate without any capacity limits and for cities to plan in-person Fourth of July celebrations and other summer festivals. The Democratic governor made the declaration as state health officials continued to crunch the vaccination numbers following a push that included a multimillion-dollar sweepstakes, other cash incentives and offers that included free child care for those who needed it in order to get their shot. Lujan Grisham wanted at least 60% of residents 16 and up to be vaccinated two weeks ahead of the reopening. Her office said that vaccinations stood at 59.4% on Thursday but that health officials were waiting for more federal data to come in that would push the state closer to its goal. Still, the governor said in a statement that she had hoped the numbers would be higher by now. “The variants across the globe and in the U.S. present very serious risks to unvaccinated people, even young people,” she said. “We all, each of us, have the power to stop the serious illnesses and deaths: Get your shot. It’s safe. It works. It’s that simple.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Fifteen months after shuttering for the pandemic, Radio City Music Hall reopened its doors Saturday for the Tribeca Festival premiere of a new Dave Chappelle documentary for a full-capacity, fully vaccinated audience. The debut of “Dave Chappelle: This Time This Place,” which chronicles Chappelle’s pandemic stand-up series held in rural Ohio cornfields, marked the first time the hallowed hall was packed since closing in March 2020. The premiere Saturday evening, the closing night gala for the 20th Tribeca Festival, was seen as a symbolic reawakening of the arts in New York, where many of the world’s most famous stages – Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Broadway theaters – remain dark. On Sunday, Madison Square Garden hosted its first full-capacity concert with the Foo Fighters. “Springsteen on Broadway” is set to resume performances June 26. After the Tribeca screening, Chappelle took the stage and paused for a moment to apologize for those who lost someone during the pandemic before signaling a note of revival. “But, man, let’s get up,” he said, before introducing a New York feast of hip-hop acts who performed according to their native borough, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Fat Joe, A$AP Ferg, Redman, Ghostface Killah and De La Soul.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed gun-rights legislation Friday that would allow parishioners at more churches to be armed, marking the second year in a row that he’s blocked the idea. The legislation affirms that people going to religious services at a location where private schools or some charter schools also meet can carry handguns in full view or under clothing if they have a concealed weapons permit. There would be other limits. The Democratic governor said the measure, which cleared the Legislature this month, would endanger educators and children. State law otherwise prohibits guns on educational property for nearly everyone. “For the safety of students and teachers, North Carolina should keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. The bill’s supporters contend these houses of worship where K-12 schools also are located are at a security disadvantage for their congregants compared to stand-alone churches. There are no such blanket prohibitions in these churches on carrying a pistol, provided the person has a purchase permit or concealed weapons permit. The bill also contains another provision that allows additional law enforcement employees – such as a civilian front desk worker at a police station – to carry a concealed weapon on the job if the police chief or sheriff allows.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators have again extended a deadline for Meridian Energy Group to begin construction on its $1 billion oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park or risk losing its permit. Meridian’s permit from the state Department of Environmental Quality was set to expire June 12 unless construction had begun on the Davis Refinery. Earlier this month the company asked for an extension on that deadline, citing delays related to the coronavirus pandemic and litigation. Recent lawsuits against Meridian have called into question the company’s ability to pay workers, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators granted an extension until Sept. 12 to start construction, a month short of what Meridian had requested. “The reasons seemed to make sense, and we thought, ‘We’ll give you guys the summer to hopefully work out your stuff and then start construction,’ ” state Environmental Engineer David Stroh said. “We requested an update from them in a little over a month so we could get a better feel for how things are progressing out there, knowing there’s a lot of attention to this facility.” Refinery opponents are concerned in part about its proximity to the national park. The North Dakota Supreme Court issued a pair of rulings last year clearing the way for the refinery to move forward.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Some casinos and racinos could be left with losing tickets if the state Senate’s sports betting legislation giving professional teams priority for obtaining brick-and mortar sports book licenses is ultimately enacted. A bill approved Wednesday by the Senate and sent to the House for consideration assigns the 30 total sports books to counties based on population. If professional sports teams in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati all decided to apply for licenses, casinos and racinos in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties would be shut out at the sports betting window of opportunity in the Senate’s bill. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, for example, has three professional sports teams as well as a downtown casino and a racino in the suburbs. Dan Reinhard, a senior vice president for the JACK Cleveland casino and a spokesperson for the casino and racino group Get Gaming Right Ohio, said Friday that the Senate bill “disrespects” casino employees. “An artificial cap that locks out gaming companies in the biggest, most populous counties doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “We know how to do this. This is the business we’re in. We’re going to work with all parties to make sure this cap is dealt with.” The original Senate bill introduced in May excluded casinos and racinos altogether.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Electric vehicle company Canoo announced Thursday it has selected Pryor for its U.S. manufacturing facility, which is expected to employ 2,000 people. The Los Angeles-based company plans to build its factory on a 400-acre campus at the MidAmerica Industrial Park near Tulsa. It will include a paint and body shop, along with a general assembly plant, and is targeted to open in 2023. “Oklahoma has always been a pioneer in the energy industry, and this partnership with Canoo shows that our state is an innovation leader in electric vehicle technology,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo and Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila to provide high-paying jobs for Oklahomans and position America as the global leader for vehicle manufacturing for decades to come.” Aquila cited Oklahoma’s strategic location and business-friendly policies as reasons Oklahoma was selected. Tulsa was in the running last year for a Tesla electric vehicle manufacturing facility that ultimately went to Austin, Texas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A second Republican in the state Senate is facing a recall effort after showing up to oppose a gun-control bill earlier this year. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports a Mount Vernon resident named Patrick Kopke-Hales has initiated a petition process that, if successful, could force a recall election against state Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale. Findley was one of six Republicans to attend a March 25 floor session, granting quorum to supermajority Democrats against the wishes of many gun-rights supporters. Though Findley spoke forcefully against Senate Bill 554 that day, Democrats passed the proposal to create new gun storage laws, ban guns in the Capitol and Portland International Airport, and allow Oregon schools and universities to implement their own bans. Senate Majority Leader Fred Girod is also facing a prospective recall because of SB 554’s passage, reflecting increasing pressure on Republicans to flee the Capitol over controversial bills after doing so to block climate change legislation in 2019 and 2020. The gun-control bill is currently the subject of a referendum effort that could give voters a final say on the law in November 2022. Findley said in a statement that “fighting for conservative values in Salem is my priority, not playing political games.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Consuewella Dotson Africa, a longtime member of the Black organization MOVE and mother of two children killed in the 1985 bombing of the group’s home, has died at age 67. A member of the MOVE family, Janine Africa, said Consuewella Africa had tested positive for the coronavirus when she went to a hospital around the beginning of the month but had largely recovered when doctors said last week that she was not getting enough oxygen. “Through the stress with everything that was happening, her body just could not fight to get the air in her lungs because she was too burnt out and tore down from the stress,” Janine Africa said. Africa’s death follows painful revelations in the past few months about the treatment of the remains of her two daughters who were killed in the police bombing of the organization’s Philadelphia home, where 11 members – including five children – were killed, and more than 60 homes were burnt to the ground. Her daughters, 14-year-old Katricia “Tree” and 12-year-old Zanetta “Netta,” died in the bombing while Consuewella Africa was in prison serving a 16-year-sentence for simple assault related to the city’s 1978 attempt to evict the group during which a police officer was killed. Consuewella Africa held the title “Minister of Confrontation” for MOVE, which identifies as both a family and an organization.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A town that was a center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade commemorated Juneteenth by unveiling a new marker recognizing its role in slavery. Officials on Saturday placed the first of two planned slavery markers in town at the Linden Place Museum, a mansion built in the 1800s by General George DeWolf, a prominent merchant and slave trader. Another medallion will be placed later this month at DeWolf Tavern. The markers are being installed at sites around the state connected to the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the Rhode Island Slave History Medallion project. They’ve been placed at Smith’s Castle in North Kingstown, Bowen’s Wharf in Newport, and Patriot’s Park in Portsmouth, according to organizers. Students and faculty from Roger Williams University planned to discuss their original research into the town’s slavery legacy. University officials say the work includes new information about the town’s lesser-known slave-trading families, as well as stories of enslaved Africans who lived and worked in town, such as Bristol Finney, a 19-year-old enslaved African who ran away from his owners. Saturday’s ceremony featured music and dance from a local African performance group, and the museum offered tours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDarlington: Historians are trying to shed light on five forgotten cemeteries in the state’s Pee Dee region. WMBF-TV reports the Darlington County Historical Commission and Clemson Professor Jim Frederick located the five graveyards near Dargan’s Pond on current Clemson property. The experts identified two African American cemeteries, two Native American burial grounds and a graveyard that dates back to the Revolutionary War. One of the sites is the cemetery of Cpt. William Standard, who was deeded land in Darlington County for his heroic service during the Revolutionary War. The pair of Native American burial grounds could date back more than 500 years. And one of the African American cemeteries is linked to one of the county’s oldest African American church congregations, the historians said. It started shortly after emancipation and was connected to the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, where it was active until the church moved locations in the 1950s. “It relates to an African American congregation that is one of the oldest congregations in Darlington County,” he said. “They lost their connection in a very unique way, and I believe there’s three factors to that.” The historians say they are now working to identify individuals in the old church cemetery.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union representing workers at a Smithfield Foods plant said Friday that its members have voted in favor of a new contract. Union leaders say the deal sends a message to the meatpacking industry that companies need to recognize the sacrifices its employees made during the coronavirus pandemic. The Smithfield plant was the nation’s most active hot spot for COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. Nearly 1,300 workers at the Sioux Falls pork processing plant tested positive for the virus, and four workers died. B.J. Motley, president of the Union Food and Commercial Workers Local 304A, said in a statement that the new contract includes fair pay, benefits and safety protections that workers have earned and deserve. “Ensuring these jobs continue to provide the good pay and benefits working families need is the best way for us to honor our country’s essential workers,” Motley said. The contract includes a base rate of $18.75 an hour, up from $17, and a $520 bonus. The union had voted earlier this month to authorize a strike after Motley said that Smithfield wanted the workers to pay more for health care and refused to increase pay to comparable rates of other meatpacking plants in the region.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A development that organizers say “is poised to become the second-largest Black-owned film studio in the United States” moved one step closer to fruition this month when the Land Use Control Board approved the zoning adjustments necessary to build BLP Film Studios, an 85-acre production facility in the Whitehaven neighborhood. “Our goal is to make Memphis the international epicenter for producing films and projects led by Black and brown creators on the production and directing side of those projects,” said Jason A. Farmer, 52, a former Marine and business executive who for the past few several years has been working to launch BLP, which he said would be eclipsed only by Tyler Perry’s facilities in Atlanta. Farmer said he believes BLP – the name is an acronym for Black Lens Productions – will attract investors as film and TV companies work to address the “diversity, equality and inclusion” concerns that have sparked debate within the entertainment industry. “Black and brown consumers are becoming more savvy,” he said, “and we find ourselves with none of the legacy production companies” that produce most of the high-profile content that brings customers to move theaters, cable channels and streaming service. He said groundbreaking is scheduled to begin in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on a threat Friday and vetoed the new state budget’s line item providing for legislative staff pay. The Republican governor had threatened the veto after a walkout by House Democrats in the final hours of the regular legislative session. The walkout denied a House quorum to vote on controversial voting restrictions that Abbott had prioritized. “Texans don’t run from a legislative fight, and they don’t walk away from unfinished business,” Abbott said in Friday’s veto message. “Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early, leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session.” However, a summer special session already was expected so that the Legislature can redraw district lines for congressional, legislative and other government offices. The budget is to take effect Sept. 1. Abbott is expected to push the voting-restrictions bill again during the summer special session. Rep. Chris Turner, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, engineered the walkout. In a statement Friday, he called Abbott’s veto “tyrannical” and the latest indication the Republican governor “is out of control.” The caucus is considering all of its options, Turner said, “including immediate legal options.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Home prices around the capital city jumped a staggering 31% over the past year in the latest sign of Utah’s housing crisis. Wasatch Front real estate agents have decried the dire lack of homes on the market as prices climb and sales bog down, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake County’s median price on a single-family home inched past the eye-catching $500,000 mark sometime in March and then reached $535,000 last month, new data shows. Average new home listings now draw 30 to 40 offers and sell in five days, the Salt Lake Board of Realtors said. The group said more construction is desperately needed to fill the gap. Nationwide, there’s a housing deficit of roughly 5.5 million units, according to an industry study that calls for ramping up the rate of U.S. homebuilding to add 2 million homes yearly over the next decade, compared with last year’s 1.3 million units built. In Utah, the shortfall is between 45,000 and 50,000 single-family homes, apartments and other housing types, with an especially serious need for more affordable homes accessible to residents making average wages.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont Food Systems Research Center is getting $11 million in federal funding to support its work researching the regional food system, from production agriculture to food security, UVM and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy announced Friday. The center is a collaboration between the university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, officials said. Vermonters turned to their local farms for food security when the pandemic struck, Leahy said in a statement. “Farms are an economic driver for our rural communities and local food is a defining feature of Vermont,” Leahy said. “We must continue to cultivate our food systems so our state can thrive and weather future emergencies.” USDA scientists are now being picked to work on campus with university researchers. “This is the first and only ARS research unit designed specifically to study diversified food systems and the smaller farms that contribute to those systems,” said UVM College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Leslie Parise. “We are proud to be leading this work at UVM and believe there is much the rest of the world can learn from the successful small- and medium-sized farms that characterize Vermont agriculture.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: After twists and turns on the road to legalizing simple possession of marijuana, advocacy groups have been flooded with calls from people trying to understand exactly what will be allowed under state law as of July 1. Legislators initially voted in February to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis for adult recreational use – but not until 2024, when retail sales would begin. An outcry ensued over the three-year wait before ending pot possession penalties, so in April the Legislature voted to move up legalization to this July 1. Adding to the confusion: Lawmakers included a “reenactment clause,” which means the General Assembly will have to vote again next year on major portions of the law, mainly to establish a regulatory framework for the legal pot marketplace. The process has resulted in some contradictions that may not get resolved until years after legalization begins. Sen. Adam Ebbin, one of the lead sponsors, said people “still need to be careful.” Possession of up to one ounce with no intent to distribute will become legal for those 21 and older. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four plants per household. But not much else will change. Buying and selling marijuana will remain illegal until 2024, when retail sales are expected to begin. Smoking marijuana in public also remains against the law.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing a bird found in the North Cascades as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to the likelihood that climate change will shrink its high-elevation habitat throughout the state. The Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan is found in the Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia to southern Washington, the Skagit Valley Herald reports. It is one of few animals that spend their entire lives on mountaintops. White-tailed ptarmigans move seasonally between snow-covered habitat and summer alpine meadows. As temperatures continue to warm, the region’s snowpack will decline. Alpine meadows may also be at risk as conditions move tree lines to higher elevations. “As the iconic alpine meadows of Washington diminish with climate change, this alpine bird … will be pushed out of the home it is specially adapted to,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Andrew LaValle said. The state Department of Fish & Wildlife lists the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan as a species of greatest concern and as highly vulnerable to climate change. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposal includes rules to protect the birds from types of intentional and unintentional harm and says a species recovery plan will be written after the listing becomes official.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice declared an end to the state’s indoor mask requirement Sunday as a $1 million winner was revealed in a drawing for residents who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Karen Foley of Mineral Wells won the top prize announced on a sweltering Father’s Day at the Capitol Complex during a celebration of the state’s 158th birthday. “Now we’re going to probably change somebody’s life in lots of ways,” Justice said before Foley’s name was announced. Prizes in separate drawings also held Sunday included custom pickup trucks, state park weekend trips, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, and hunting rifles and shotguns. Two younger vaccinated residents won college scholarships, including tuition, room and board, and books. Justice announced a series of random drawings May 27. The deadline for Sunday’s drawing was last Wednesday, and the winners were drawn Thursday. More than 246,000 West Virginians had registered. The names of entrants who don’t win will be carried over week to week. Residents can still sign up for six other drawings, which will be held on Wednesdays from June 30 to Aug. 4. The final drawing will include a $1.588 million grand prize and a $588,000 second prize.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson joined in a Juneteenth Day celebration in his home state only to see his speech drowned out by a chorus of boos. Johnson made an appearance Saturday at a Republican Party booth in Milwaukee, where he drew a growing crowd once people recognized him. Some people swore at him and said: “We don’t want you here.” Last year Johnson blocked legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Last week he relented while saying that “it still seems strange” that taxpayers should fund time off for federal employees to celebrate the end of slavery. The bill was quickly passed and signed by President Joe Biden. When asked what he thought of the boos Saturday, Johnson said: “This is unusual for Wisconsin. Most people in Wisconsin say, ‘You are in our prayers; we are praying for you.’ … But you got some people here that are just sort of nasty at some points.” One attendee, Robert Agnew, said he thought the reason for the taunting was that “Ron Johnson’s politics are not for us.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Supporters of two new marijuana ballot petitions say they’re optimistic about getting pot questions before voters next year, especially with growing support from conservatives in the deep-red state. Even so, they face daunting odds because of the difficulty of getting such initiatives on the ballot and failing to do so four years ago. The Legislature legalized hemp and hemp oil in 2019, but Wyoming is among a dwindling number of states that haven’t approved marijuana in some form. Thirty-six states now allow medical marijuana, and 17 have approved recreational marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This time around, some Republicans are finding common cause with Democrats and others on marijuana. “It’s well past due,” state Rep. Mark Baker said. “If they’re successful in reaching the ballot and putting the question to the people, I do think it is going to be successful.” Baker, R-Green River, stepped down as director of the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws after being elected last year. Other outspoken supporters include a state representative who last year became the first Libertarian Party candidate elected to a U.S. statehouse in 20 years. One petition would seek to legalize marijuana for medical use. The other would decriminalize it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}]}
