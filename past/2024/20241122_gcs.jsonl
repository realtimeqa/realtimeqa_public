The group traditionally meets around economic issues, which this year were directly linked to sanctions on Russia and rising global energy costs.\n\nTo finish up his time in Asia, the U.S. president had planned to plant a mangrove tree with G-20 leaders and meet with the U.K. prime minister before an afternoon return to Washington for his granddaughter's weekend wedding.\n\nBut overnight, reports began circulating that two civilians in a rural Polish town near the Ukrainian border had been killed by a missile.\n\nU.S. officials scrambled to determine whether the missile strike was an intentional Russian attack on a NATO ally, which would warrant a military response, or the result of an errant Russian missile that had veered off target, possibly because of Ukrainian air defense systems.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda said Wednesday that there was no evidence of an intentional attack on his country. The missile, which killed two people in a rural area, appeared to be Russian-made, Duda said. Ukraine's weaponry includes Russian-made missiles.\n\nThe scenario that played out in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time was one of chaos and confusion as Biden and the leaders of the world's most powerful economies would have been fast asleep.\n\nUS, NATO INVESTIGATE BLAST IN POLAND:Biden says missile unlikely to have been fired from Russia\n\nItaly, Germany, France, the U.K., Japan and Canada, which make up the G-7 alongside the U.S., had been meeting formally and informally for two days in Indonesia. They had concluded their evening with a gala.\n\nBiden did not attend the dinner. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not at the G-20 summit.\n\nRussia's foreign minister was captured leaving Bali on Tuesday evening in video taken by AFP as Moscow launched its attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine.\n\nInstead, the president was up before dawn and fielding phone calls from his Bali hotel.\n\nBiden spoke to his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, then to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nHe hustled shortly thereafter to an emergency roundtable with G-7 countries attending the summit, plus the heads of the European Commission, the European Council, the Netherlands and Spain.\n\nThe press was ushered into the ballroom decorated with Balinese umbrellas, where Biden and other leaders posed for a solemn photo – a departure from the customary “family photo” of heads of government that is a standard in these global summits.\n\nAfter their discussion, Biden said in remarks: \"We agreed to support Poland’s investigation into the explosion in rural Poland near the Ukrainian border. And I’m going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened.\"\n\nBiden has long promised that America would fight alongside its allies to defend NATO territory if Russia takes its war beyond Ukraine's borders.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member nation. Poland is. And an attack on one NATO nation, according to the security organization's charter, is considered an attack on all.\n\nThe United States has provided roughly $20 billion to Ukraine for its defense to keep the fight from moving into other parts of Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nYet, in addressing reporters just after G-7 leaders met for crisis talks, Biden said preliminary information indicated that the missile responsible for the strike was not fired from Russia.\n\n\"We’re going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed. There was total unanimity among the folks at the table,\" Biden said.\n\nUkraine's advanced air defense weaponry could have driven the missile off course or exploded it near Poland, a U.S. official told USA TODAY.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the missile that landed in Poland was an intercept missile fired by Ukraine as it defended itself. The exact cause of the fatalities are still under investigation.\n\nRussia's latest military assault on Ukraine came just hours after its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, delivered a forceful speech about sovereignty to G-20 leaders and referred to the group, which still includes Russia, as the G-19 during an appearance at the summit by video link.\n\n\"Ukraine should not be offered to conclude compromises with its conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We respect the rules, and we are people of our word.\n\n\"Ukraine has always been a leader in peacekeeping efforts, and the world has witnessed it. And if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions.\"\n\nBiden, who will be in the air until late Thursday evening, had not been in contact with Zelenskyy from Bali or Air Force One since the Polish missile strike, a White House official said.\n\nBIDEN IN BALI: At G-20 summit, Biden to push nations to enforce oil and gas limits on Russia\n\nBiden's dilemma and NATO\n\nA potential escalation of the Ukraine conflict of this magnitude presented a myriad of challenges for Biden – even as the United States has pledged unwavering support of the European nation.\n\nIn a joint statement after their early-morning conference, G-7 leaders reaffirmed their \"steadfast support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the face of ongoing Russian aggression\" and pledged \"continued readiness to hold Russia accountable for its brazen attacks on Ukrainian communities, even as the G-20 meets to deal with the wider impacts of the war.\"\n\nPoland, which is not a part of the G-7 or G-20 and was not at the the Bali conference, said it was considering activating Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. That would trigger a discussion within NATO about the security of the country, which shares a more than 300-mile border with Ukraine.\n\nBiden said in his remarks that the consensus of nations that took part in the emergency meeting was the next step was a meeting of ambassadors.\n\nFormer officials at the State Department and Defense Department were skeptical that Russia would intentionally target Poland, knowing a provocative attack could spark a world war.\n\n\"It's possible that they were trying to test NATO,\" said Matthew Koenig, director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at that Atlantic Council and a former senior policy adviser at the Pentagon.\n\nKoenig said he doubted Russia deliberately attacked Poland. But if it did, he said, that would \"come as a real dilemma for the United States and for Biden.\"\n\n\"I think there will be pressure, if this is indeed a Russian missile, for the United States to do something,\" he said. \"This is a really hard spot for the president to be in.\"\n\nIn Washington at a State Department briefing, deputy spokesman Vedant Patel declined to say how the missile strike, if it was determined to have come from Russia, would fit into Biden's repeated pledges to defend every inch of NATO territory.\n\nBiden said in remarks on the strike later that NATO and G-7 leaders collectively determined an investigation was the appropriate next step.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former speechwriter to John Kerry at the State Department, said that even if it was an inadvertent strike, \"it is still the actions of the Russian government that caused the deaths of two NATO citizens, of two Poles. So I think this requires a response.\"\n\n\"No matter what Russia is the culprit and is to blame here\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/asia/apec-summit-china-xi-center-stage-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "With Biden and Putin absent from APEC, China's Xi takes center ...", "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping arrived in Bangkok Thursday for the last of three back-to-back international summits held over the past week in Asia – this time for a gathering where the leaders of the United States and Russia will both be absent.\n\nThat leaves Xi primed to enter the two-day Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ meeting in the Thai capital without needing to face US President Joe Biden at an economic summit focused on a region at the heart of the US-China contest.\n\nThe expected absence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Bangkok, as in Bali for the Group of 20 (G20) summit earlier this week, will also leave Xi unencumbered by the optics of meeting a counterpart he’s described as a bosom friend, who has become a pariah in the West following his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nInstead, Xi will be a key figure among a list of participants from a region where Washington and Beijing have long vied for influence, leaving him well-placed to promote China’s economic vision as leaders gather to discuss issues including inflation, climate change, rising food prices and energy insecurity, building on discussions at separate summits in Phnom Penh and Bali in recent days.\n\nXi laid out that vision in a written statement released Thursday evening to a convention of top business leaders meeting alongside the APEC summit, in which he decried “Cold War mentality, hegemonism, unilateralism and protectionism” – echoing Beijing’s typical criticisms of the US, without mentioning it by name.\n\n“The Asia Pacific is no one’s backyard and should not become an area for big power contest. No attempt to wage a new cold war will ever be allowed by the people or by our times!” Xi said in the statement.\n\n“Any attempt to disrupt or even dismantle the industrial supply chains … will only lead Asia Pacific economic cooperation to a dead end,” he said in a veiled reference to economic decoupling.\n\nNo peer?\n\nXi enters the APEC leaders’ summit, which officially begins Friday, having already hit his diplomatic stride in the G20 meeting in Bali earlier this week – where his aim was to cast China as an integral part of a global arena alongside Western powers after an absence from the world stage.\n\nThe G20 marked Xi’s first major international summit since he broke norms to claim a third term atop China’s Communist Party last month, and his first time meeting multiple Group of Seven (G7) leaders together and face-to-face since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThat meeting saw Xi holding seemingly constructive talks and grinning in photos with leaders who have recently raised alarms about China as a global threat. He was also captured in video footage chiding Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a smile.\n\nWhile tensions with the West remain acute, the diplomacy has placed Xi on a strong footing entering this next summit, where the Chinese leader is expected to address business leaders and continue his string of bilateral talks, including with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\n“Xi’s outreach is successful so far. The world has accepted his third term by default, and he is able to demonstrate that he can command both domestic and foreign audiences,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center.\n\n“For APEC, China was going to be the center of attention with or without Biden and Putin. But without them, Xi has no peer in the room … It will be his show.\n\n“The implied message is also important in that it illustrates how the US and Russia are not as engaged as China.”\n\nHarris in Asia\n\nBut the US has other ideas. While Biden flew back to the US Wednesday to be at his granddaughter’s wedding, Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the APEC forum before traveling to the Philippines.\n\nA senior White House official told reporters that Harris would address a meeting of business leaders happening alongside the summit and express there was “no better partner” than the US in the region.\n\nThe US escalated its economic competition with China last month with the launch of unprecedented measures from Washington to limit the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment China – a move likely to have knock-on effects on APEC member economies.\n\nEarlier this year, Washington launched its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework – the economic centerpiece for Biden’s plan for engaging with the region as it competes with China – which includes a number of APEC member economies, but not China or Russia. The US will host APEC next year.\n\nAlso at stake is how APEC leaders choose to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the G20, with Biden and the wealthy G7 leaders in attendance, the summit concluded with a joint declaration strongly condemning the war in Ukraine. As at the G20, Russia will be represented by a lower-level official, with First Deputy Prime Minister Andrey Belousov speaking for Moscow in Bangkok, according to Russian state media.\n\nWhile the economic fallout of the war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda, how or whether participating leaders choose to implicate Russia over those effects could impact any concluding agreements from the summit.\n\nEconomic stress\n\nAnd while Xi may project power on the guest list, China’s own economic woes in recent months have loomed over the region and are likely to be another area of attention. Late last month, the IMF listed China’s “sharp and uncharacteristic” economic slowdown as a key headwind facing the Asia Pacific region, as its slashed it growth projections by nearly a percentage point.\n\nIn his written statement to business leaders on Thursday – a day before Harris is scheduled to address the same conference – Xi called for “openness” in the regional economy and accelerating scientific and technological advancement there.\n\n“I hope that all of you, as business leaders, will … actively involve yourselves in economic cooperation and China’s reform, opening-up and modernization endeavors,” he said.\n\nBut observers will also be looking to the Chinese leader for clarity on Beijing’s economic agenda, in particular as its borders – and supply chains – remain heavily impacted by ongoing Covid-19 controls, despite a policy easing last month. A sweeping regulatory crackdown on its tech industry last year has also caused concerns.\n\n“This is the big question mark on the minds of many of us,” former Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon told CNN, referring to how long China will maintain its zero-Covid policy and tight border controls, which have dragged on Thailand’s crucial tourism industry.\n\n“It’s important for (APEC) participants to talk to the Chinese President about this,” he said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/india/modi-india-g20-influence-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "G20's criticism of Russia shows the rise of a new Asian power.

Willy Kurniawan/Reuters\n\nThe declaration came as Indonesian President Joko Widodo handed over the G20 presidency to Modi, who will host the next leaders’ summit in the Indian capital New Delhi in September 2023 – about six months before he is expected to head to the polls in a general election and contest the country’s top seat for a third time.\n\nAs New Delhi deftly balances its ties to Russia and the West, Modi, analysts say, is emerging as a leader who has been courted by all sides, winning him support at home, while cementing India as an international power broker.\n\n“The domestic narrative is that the G20 summit is being used as a big banner in Modi’s election campaign to show he’s a great global statesmen,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at New Delhi-based think tank Center for Policy Research. “And the current Indian leadership now sees themselves as a powerful country seated at the high table.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Modi tells Putin: Now is not the time for war (September 2022) 02:53 - Source: CNN\n\nIndia bridges ‘multiple antagonists’\n\nOn some accounts, India’s presence at the G20 was overshadowed by the much anticipated meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, and the scramble to investigate the killing of two Polish citizens after what Warsaw said was a “Russian-made missile” landed in a village near the NATO-member’s border with Ukraine.\n\nGlobal headlines covered in detail how Biden and Xi met for three hours on Monday, in an attempt to prevent their rivalry from spilling into open conflict. And on Wednesday, leaders from the G7 and NATO convened an emergency meeting in Bali to discuss the explosion in Poland.\n\nModi, on the other hand, held a series of discussions with several world leaders, including newly appointed British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, ranging from food security and environment, to health and economic revival – steering largely clear of condemning Putin’s aggression outright, while continuing to distance his country from Russia.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hold a bilateral meeting on November 16, 2022 in Nusa Dua, Indonesia. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nWhile India had a “modest agenda” for the G20 revolving around the issues of energy, climate, and economic turmoil as a result of the war, Western leaders “are listening to India as a major stakeholder in the region, because India is a country that is close to both the West and Russia,” said Happymon Jacob, associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi.\n\nNew Delhi has strong ties with Moscow dating back to the Cold War, and India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for military equipment – a vital link given India’s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with an increasingly assertive China.\n\nAt the same time, New Delhi has been growing closer to the West as leaders attempt to counter the rise of Beijing, placing India in a strategically comfortable position.\n\n“One of the ways in which India had an impact at the G20 is that it seems to be one of the few countries that can engage all sides,” said Harsh V. Pant, professor in international relations at King’s College London. “It’s a role that India has been able to bridge between multiple antagonists.”\n\n‘Voice of the developing world’\n\nSince the start of the war, India has repeatedly called for a cessation of violence in Ukraine, falling short of condemning Russia’s invasion outright.\n\nBut as Putin’s aggression has intensified, killing thousands of people and throwing the global economy into chaos, analysts say India’s limits are being put to the test.\n\nObservers point out Modi’s stronger language to Putin in recent months was made in the context of rising food, fuel and fertilizer prices, and the hardships that was creating for other countries. And while this year’s G20 was looked at through the lens of the war, India could bring its own agenda to the table next year.\n\n“India’s taking over the presidency comes at a time when the world is placing a lot of focus on renewable energy, rising prices and inflation,” Jacob from JNU said. “And there is a feeling that India is seen as a key country that can provide for the needs of the region in South Asia and beyond.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and China's leader Xi Jinping attend the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, on November 15.

And if that remains strong, then the international audience is bound to respect him.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/biden-bali-g20-summit-final-day/index.html", "title": "Biden says allies working in 'total unanimity' after Russian-made ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden emerged from an emergency meeting with top allies during his final day at the G20 in Indonesia promising to “figure out exactly what happened” after a Russian-made missile fell inside the borders of a NATO ally.\n\n“We agreed to support Poland’s investigations into the explosion in rural Poland near the Ukrainian border and we’re gonna make sure we figure out exactly what happened,” Biden told reporters following his emergency roundtable with leaders at the G20 Summit.\n\nBiden added, “Then we’re gonna collectively determine next step as we investigate.”\n\nThe president had just exited the meeting in Bali on Wednesday morning local time. The talks came after Poland’s foreign ministry said late Tuesday that the “Russian-made missile” fell on the village of Przewodów. On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday was “probably an accident” from the Ukrainian side while intercepting incoming Russian missiles.\n\nThe statement appeared to confirm something that Biden alluded to earlier when speaking to the press after being asked if the missile was fired from Russia.\n\n“There is preliminary information that contests that,” he answered.\n\nHe added, “I don’t want to say that until we completely investigate. It’s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we’ll see.”\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry had denied that there were strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border.\n\nBiden and leaders from the G7 and NATO were in the roundtable. The meeting included Biden and leaders from Canada, the European Union, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan, the officials said.\n\nThe president said that there was “total unanimity among folks at the table” about how to respond to the incident. He did not provide other information about the source of the missile.\n\nDuring a call with Duda earlier, Biden “expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening,” the White House said in a readout.\n\n“President Duda described Poland’s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. President Biden offered full US support for and assistance with Poland’s investigation,” the readout continued.\n\nBiden “reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to NATO” and the leaders agreed to have their teams “remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.”\n\nAt the summit, Biden and most G20 members have been slated to sign onto a statement condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine “and the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,” according to a senior administration official previewing the statement. Such an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it’s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration.\n\nBefore beginning a long journey back to Washington, Biden participated in a mangrove tree planting with other G20 leaders. He also met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom for the first time since Sunak took office last month.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Netherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and European Council President Charles Michel attend an emergency meeting of global leaders after an alleged Russian missile blast in Poland, in Bali, Indonesia, November 16, 2022.

Truss resigned six weeks into a term that plunged Britain into political and economic turmoil. Sunak is the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead the UK. He is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nSplit screen moment\n\nWhite House officials were expecting a split screen moment this week as Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment his predecessor was announcing a third presidential run.\n\nBut the dynamic was amplified as Biden convened the emergency talks at the same hour Trump loyalists filled the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for former President Donald Trump’s announcement.\n\nBiden was leading the crisis talks with members of the G7 and NATO in Bali – two groupings Trump questioned the usefulness of when he was in office.\n\nLess than 10 minutes after he finished speaking to reporters, Trump walked on stage at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHeading into the trip, Biden’s advisers were not particularly concerned about the split-screen and, after Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm elections, were even less wary of Trump announcing a third bid for president while Biden was in Asia.\n\nFor one, Biden officials are happy to take the comparison between the current president and the former on the foreign stage, given the general chaos that often trailed Trump as he traveled abroad.\n\nBiden’s team also believe the president’s newfound acclaim among Democrats compares favorably to Trump’s post-midterms status within the Republican Party — still an evolving picture, but showing signs of erosion.\n\nTrump’s announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Biden’s on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention.\n\nThroughout the course of his meetings in Asia this week, Biden has been approached by fellow leaders bearing congratulations following the midterm results, a signal the American political contests were being closely monitored by leaders on the opposite side of the world.\n\nIt was a phenomenon that surprised some of his aides, particularly the specificity with which many of the leaders were watching. It was a sign, according to one senior administration official, that the stakes of the midterm elections extended well beyond US borders. Biden himself had framed the contest as putting democracy on the ballot — stakes that leaders in foreign capitals were highly attuned to as they work to determine which way the political winds are blowing in the United States.\n\nAhead of the elections, foreign diplomats posted to Washington traveled the country working to suss out the political temperature, all with the goal of determining whether Trump could be poised for a political comeback.\n\nIf the collection of election deniers and Trump acolytes vying for office amounted to a signal that the former president’s influence was still alive within Republican politics – and that his return to the White House remained a distinct possibility – the widespread rejection of those candidates last week sent an alternate signal abroad.\n\nFor Biden, the timing could not have been more opportune. The prospect of a midterm wipeout loomed over preparations for his around-the-world trip over the last several weeks. Widespread Republican wins – including by election deniers – would badly complicate the president’s bedrock message that Democracies will win out against autocracies.\n\nTrump’s tease of a campaign announcement at the very moment Biden would be rallying the world behind democratic ideals only elevated the stakes.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/asia/china-xi-jinping-canada-justin-trudeau-g20-intl/index.html", "title": "China's Xi Jinping lectures Justin Trudeau over alleged leaks | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping was captured by Canadian broadcasters in a rare candid moment on Wednesday, where he was filmed chiding his Canadian counterpart, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, over what he described as “leaked” discussions.\n\nOn the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia, Xi chatted with Trudeau in Mandarin with a smile. But the English translation of what he said was a little less friendly.\n\n“Everything we’ve discussed has been leaked to the papers and that is not appropriate,” Xi’s translator said.\n\nTrudeau nods and Xi spoke again. “And that was not how the conversation was conducted,” the translator said.\n\n“If there was sincerity on your part, than we shall conduct our discussion with an attitude of mutual respect, otherwise there might be unpredictable consequences,” Xi tells the Canadian leader in Mandarin.\n\nXi’s translator attempts to translate what was said, only getting to “If there was sincerity on your part,” before being cut off by Trudeau.\n\n“In Canada we believe in a free and open and frank dialogue,” Trudeau said, adding “we will continue to work constructively together, but there will be things that we will disagree on.”\n\n“Let’s create the conditions first,” the translator said on behalf of Xi in the video. The Chinese leader then shakes Trudeau’s hand and walked away with his entourage.\n\nThe exchange offers a rare glimpse of how Xi, whose public appearances are highly choreographed, interacts with other leaders.\n\nNot every conversation will be “easy,” Trudeau said Wednesday, according to a statement he gave to the press after the exchange.\n\n“But it’s extremely important we continue to stand up for the things that are important for Canadians. This is something we always do and we will continue to,” Trudeau said.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, China’s foreign ministry said Canada should “create conditions with concrete actions” to improve ties with Beijing.\n\n“China has no problem with candid conversations, but we would like these conversations to be carried out equally and with mutual respect, instead of pointing fingers condescendingly,” ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said Thursday. “As far as difficulties in recent China-Canada bilateral relations are concerned, it is clear that the responsibilities lie not with China.”\n\nMao also rejected characterizations of Xi’s remark as a threat, adding that the video should not be construed as Xi criticizing anyone.\n\nThe exchange between the two leaders comes as Xi looks to reassert China’s global influence at the summit in the island of Bali after a nearly three-year absence from the world stage.\n\nChina’s relations with United States allies have deteriorated to varying degrees in recent years, due to rising geopolitical tensions, disputes over trade and the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow – despite Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nXi has sought to restore relationships at the summit, meeting with US President Joe Biden on Monday. He also held formal talks with the leaders of Australia, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Senegal, Argentina, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nCanada was not afforded such a meeting, and the snub might relate to the countries choppy relationship since senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was detained in Canada in 2018.

Sign up here.\n\nBali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nXi Jinping may have rejected US President Joe Biden’s description of the 21st century as a battle between democracies and autocracies, but as the G20 and APEC summits showed, the Chinese leader remains intent on pushing back at American influence overseas.\n\nStill basking in the afterglow of a Communist Party Congress that last month saw him consolidate and extend his grip on power at home, the strongman leader emerged from China’s zero-Covid isolation with a flurry of in-person meetings in Bali and Bangkok last week.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping attends the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia on Wednesday. Willy Kurniawan/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nIn contrast to his self-cultivated image as an ideological hardliner, Xi attempted to portray himself as a broad-minded statesman, telling Biden in their meeting last Monday that leaders “should think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThis sweeping diplomatic outreach appeared specifically targeted at US allies and regional leaders caught in an intensifying rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Since taking office, Biden has shored up relations with allies and partners to counter China’s growing influence.\n\n“Asia Pacific is no one’s backyard and should not become an area for big power contest,” Xi said Friday at the opening of the APEC summit, in the absence of Biden, who had already flown back to the US.\n\nThe whirlwind of face-to-face diplomacy represents something of a victory for Xi, whose self-imposed international isolation had proved extremely costly as China’s relations plummeted with the West and many of its neighbors during the pandemic. Tensions have flared over the origins of the coronavirus, trade, territorial claims, Beijing’s human rights record and its close partnership with Russia despite the devastating war in Ukraine.\n\n“Judging from the sheer volume of international heads of states wanting to have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, I think it’s safe to say that (the trip) has been successful on Xi’s part,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program.\n\nWith broad smiles and handshakes, the Chinese leader held exchanges with his counterparts from the US, Australia, France, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, among others – including leaders whose governments had openly criticized Beijing.\n\nAnd in multiple speeches, Xi, who earlier this year had joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in proclaiming plans to create a “new world order,” attempted to now present himself as a leader for international unity. In a thinly veiled dig at the US, he decried “ideological division,” “block politics,” “cold war mentality,” and attempts to “politicize and weaponize economic and trade relations.”\n\nOver the two summits, Xi held a total of 20 bilateral meetings in a schedule so packed it sometimes stretched late into the night. He also made a point of holding most of the meetings in his hotel.\n\nThe optics speak for themselves.\n\n“All the leaders were lining up patiently to meet the ‘emperor’ of China,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nBut despite the apparent outreach, Xi also showed he was ready to confront perceived slights.\n\nIn a rare, candid moment caught on camera, Xi chided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him of leaking details of a brief conversation between them. As they parted ways, Xi could be heard off camera describing Trudeau as “very naive.”\n\n“It reminded the whole world that there are limits to this smiling diplomacy – as soon as you cross upon China’s interest you can get into trouble,” Cabestan said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's Xi confronts Canadian prime minister in hot mic moment 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nXi’s goal\n\nFor Xi, the diplomatic flurry with Western leaders is a crucial first step toward normalizing relations – which had been severely strained by his assertive foreign policy and the “wolf-warrior” diplomacy of Chinese diplomats.\n\nDespite its often aggressive stance, Beijing is increasingly worried about economic decoupling with the West. The poor state of the Chinese economy – thanks to unrelenting zero-Covid lockdowns and the recent US ban on the export of advanced semiconductor chips to China – have added to Beijing’s urgency to reverse the trend.\n\nNotably, among the leaders Xi met in Bali was Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, home to semiconductor giant ASML – which is under increasing pressure from the US to stop selling its products to China.\n\nDuring their meeting, Xi urged Rutte to avoid “decoupling” and the “politicization of economic and trade issues,” and invited him to visit Beijing next year.\n\n“While Biden may be trying to build a so-called values based alignment against China, Xi is trying to find ways to weaken the cohesion of that alignment by pursuing top-level diplomacy one on one with those countries,” said Sung, the political scientist.\n\nXi’s numerous meetings with US allies are all the more remarkable given recent tensions with Beijing over trade, geopolitics and China’s human rights crackdown on Xinjiang and Hong Kong. In other multilateral settings, such as the Group of Seven summit, Western nations had issued strongly worded statements expressing concerns about China’s human rights record and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Amidst all that, Xi has proven that China still has enough lure and stature to attract all these countries to find ways to work with China. So in that sense, it’s successful diplomacy on Xi’s part,” Sung said.\n\nDomestic message\n\nThe international posturing is also intended for the Chinese domestic audience.\n\nFor Xi, the key message he wanted to send home was already set at the start of the trip, when he met Biden face-to-face for the first time as national leaders.\n\n“The fact that Xi was talking with Biden in a one-on-one setting, with confidence and smiles throughout, generates this image that the era of ‘G2’ has arrived,” Sung said.\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has touted the “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation – his vision of restoring China to its past glory and reclaiming its rightful place as a world leader. In recent years, he has also pushed the notion that the East is rising, and the West is in decline.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden describes what he discussed with Xi Jinping in G20 meeting 03:43 - Source: CNN\n\nTo Xi’s domestic audience, the image of a superpower “G2” – China and the United States – served as a vivid visual representation of both narratives. “China now can talk with the US like a true equal,” Sung said.\n\nBut Chinese people who followed glowing state media coverage of Xi’s trip would have also noticed a striking image: their top leader attending indoor gatherings and mingling with world leaders without a face mask.\n\nThat was a far cry from Xi’s caution for Covid during his first trip abroad since the pandemic. When he visited Central Asia in September, Xi wore a mask to disembark from his plane and skipped a mask-free group dinner where leaders ate and talked around the table.\n\nThis time around, Xi appeared much more comfortable being maskless. He also attended the Group of 20 dinner, where he shook hands and chatted with leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBack home in China, however, snap lockdowns and mass testing edicts continue to torment residents, despite the government’s recent announcement of limited easing of its zero-Covid policy.\n\nIn the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, residents revolted against a Covid lockdown, tearing down barriers and marching down streets. In the central city of Zhengzhou, the death of a 4-month-old girl in hotel quarantine stoked nationwide outcry – the second death of a child under Covid restrictions this month.\n\nHaving had a taste of what living with Covid could look like in Bali and Bangkok, Xi returned Saturday to a China under siege from rising infections and tightening restrictions in many cities.\n\nApart from the Dutch Prime Minister, Xi also invited US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s newly elected Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to visit Beijing early next year.\n\nWhether they will visit a China free of Covid restrictions – and potential travel quarantines – remains to be seen.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/opinions/g7-boys-club-leaders-women-ghitis/index.html", "title": "Opinion: 'Show them our pecs!'

For the first time in 16 years, the G7 summit, the gathering of leaders of some of the planet’s seven wealthiest democracies, doesn’t have a single nationally elected woman among the principals.\n\nFrida Ghitis CNN\n\nThe moment is particularly jarring because it comes as women in the United States have suffered one of the most grievous reversals to their freedom in recent memory. The G7 boys gathered while the streets of the US were seething with rage, teeming with women and their allies incensed, infuriated after the Supreme Court rescinded Roe v. Wade, the ruling that guaranteed women the freedom to choose what they can do with their bodies – their lives – when they become pregnant; one of most fundamental of women’s rights. One of the most basic of human rights.\n\nFrom the formal G7 gatherings high in the Bavarian mountains to the judicial rulings down in Washington, it almost looks as if the Earth is spinning backward.\n\nDoes the arc of the moral universe, as has become almost cliché, really bend toward justice? Does history move toward more freedom, more equality, more democracy, more peace? One could be forgiven for thinking those ideas are the product of naively optimistic minds. But is that the right conclusion? Back to that in a moment.\n\nUp in Bavaria, it might have been sheer coincidence, but the banter was high in macho content. Apparently discussing whether to take off their jackets for a group photo, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked, “Jackets on? Jackets off? Shall we take our clothes off?” All, of course, for geostrategic purposes. “We have to show that we’re tougher than Putin,” added Johnson. Canada’s Justin Trudeau jokingly suggested doing the Putinesque “bare-chested horseback riding display.” Johnson liked the idea, “There you go! We’ve got to show them our pecs!”\n\nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin rides a horse during his vacation in Siberia, 2009. Alexey Druzhinin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeated around the table with the seven leaders was Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission and a “non-enumerated member” of the G7 club; the only woman. She gamely muttered, “Horseback riding is the best.” Was she cringing inside?\n\n(The EU, not a country but a “supranational organization,” has a special place in the G7).\n\nWhen it comes to G7 summits, one of the most iconic images came in 2018. You remember then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel standing, her arms pushed down against the table, staring down, confronting former President Donald Trump, who was seated below her, looking up at her, arms crossed.\n\nThat was the summit where Trump undermined the alliance, arrived late and left early, refusing to sign the joint communique and unsuccessfully pressuring the group to readmit Russia and President Vladimir Putin, who had been expelled for invading Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel deliberates with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Charlevoix, Canada, 2018. Jesco Denzel/Bundesregierung/Getty Images\n\nThe last time the G7 had no women, in 2005, it was actually the G8, with Russia on board. A photograph from that summit, in Scotland, shows Putin in his tuxedo along with the others leaders and Queen Elizabeth II, their ceremonial host.\n\nFor a decade and a half, Merkel was a key player in the G7, always the only woman except for the two years when the UK’s Theresa May joined her. The reality is that the grouping, like most powerful institutions around the world, has been overwhelmingly male all along.\n\nEvery once in a while, it looked like a trend might be starting. Merkel joined in 2006, May in 2018, and for a time it seemed the US might get a woman president. Now we’re back to 100 % of the G7 national members led by men.\n\nThere are many reasons why the struggle for women to have a seat at the table – many seats – is so difficult. Decisions by a US Supreme Court whose members have all been chosen by male presidents and confirmed by male-dominated Senates are illustrative. (Though the most recent addition to the court is a woman.) After the Court overturned Roe, the United Nations women’s agency warned, “The ability of women to control what happens to their bodies is also associated with the other roles women are able to play in society, whether as a member of the family, the workforce, or government.”\n\nCenturies of imbalance cannot be easily reversed, as is now excruciatingly obvious.\n\nOur view of history, however, is limited. And history is long.\n\nThe battle is tough, frustrating, and it includes crushing – temporary – defeats. But the story does not end there. And the reverses, significant as they are, are not happening everywhere.\n\nA look beyond the front seat at the G7 reveals something interesting. Of the seven countries, a majority – France, Canada, Germany and the UK – have women foreign ministers. The US has reverted to having men at the State Department after Madeline Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. But around the world, the battle for women shows that what’s happening in the US despite the display at the G7, looks more like an anomaly than a trend.\n\nIn fact, worldwide condemnation of the US abortion decision extended to G7 leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his support for American women “whose liberties are being undermined” by the Court, as lawmakers in his party proposed securing abortion rights in the French constitution. Canada’s Trudeau called the ruling, “horrific,” and Johnson branded it “a big step backwards.”\n\nThe US is in a tiny minority in adding restrictions to abortion rights. Dozens of countries have rewritten their laws in recent years, almost all of them have made reproductive choices more easily available to women. That’s true even in devoutly Catholic Latin America and Ireland. In Israel, in reaction to the shock from the US, the government eased access to abortion, which the health minister described as setting back women’s rights by “100 years.”\n\nA dear friend, a highly successful woman, told me a couple of days ago that without abortion rights, “I would be living in a trailer.” The stakes are simply too high to allow the usurpation of rights to stand.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEventually – I don’t know when – the US WILL restore the nationwide right to abortion. History doesn’t move in a straight line but it ultimately does move forward. Freedoms are gained and they are lost. Democracies moves forward and sometimes they take ugly detours. Sometimes, catastrophe strikes in places that looked promising. That’s one of the frightening lessons of history.\n\nAnother lesson of history is that positive change doesn’t come without a relentless effort by people committed to doing the work it requires. The G7 picture will include women national leaders in the not-too-distant future. And in the US, women will regain the rights now being taken away from them.", "authors": ["Frida Ghitis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959217/unlikely-political-friendships-through-the-years", "title": "Unlikely political friendships through the years | The Week", "text": "A former Conservative minister threw her support behind Labour leader Keir Starmer this week after quitting her own party and branding it ridden with “ideology and self-obsession”.\n\nClaire Perry O’Neill, who was a Tory MP from 2010 to 2019 and served as a member of Theresa May’s cabinet as well as briefly under Boris Johnson, said in an article for The Times that she had quit the Conservative Party earlier this month, before lavishing praise on the Labour leader.\n\nIn an article on the growth of renewable energy, she said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his chancellor Jeremy Hunt are “too beholden to a party dominated now by ideology and self-obsession to deliver the big changes we need in a fact-based, competent way”.

Labour List reported that a catalyst behind the switch had been Wakeford’s friendship with Labour MP Barry Gardiner, following their work together in support of Gardiner’s anti “fire and rehire” bill.\n\nFriendships across the political divide are “always surprising to outside observers” within the walls of Westminster but “they are so common that they are rarely commented upon”, wrote former Labour MP Tom Harris in The Telegraph. Nevertheless, such friendships are frequently a “love that dare not speak its name” in the public eye, he said.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the more surprising political friendships within Westminster and across the world.\n\nAlastair Campbell and Charles Kennedy\n\nFormer New Labour spin doctor and journalist Alastair Campell wrote movingly about his close friendship with the late Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy in an article for the i news site in 2021.\n\nBecoming close during the New Labour years – despite significant disagreement on the Iraq War – Campbell wrote that he was “taken aback by just how deeply grief-stricken” he was when the Lib Dem politician died in 2015. He paid tribute to a friendship that “taught me it is possible to be on different sides in politics, but the same side when it comes to basic humanity”.\n\nIan Paisley and Martin McGuinness\n\nSinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness and the DUP’s Ian Paisley formed an unlikely political friendship after the two parties came to a power-sharing agreement in 2007 (Image credit: Paul Faith/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nLong-standing and often bitter political rivals in Northern Irish politics, Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness and the DUP’s Ian Paisley formed an unlikely political friendship after the two parties came to a power-sharing agreement in 2007.\n\nAfter Paisley and McGuinness became First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the pair would frequently travel together, albeit discreetly, sharing the same aircraft but disembarking separately to avoid being seen together. Their close bond quickly became evident, however, earning them the nickname “The Chuckle Brothers”.\n\n“Our relationship confounded many. Of course, our political differences continued; his allegiance was to Britain and mine to Ireland. But we were able to work effectively together in the interests of all our people,” said McGuinness after Paisley’s death, according to the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nMargaret Thatcher and Augusto Pinochet\n\nThe friendship between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was “widely criticised” at the time, said MSN.com. The unlikely alliance began in 1982 when Chile assisted Britain in regaining the Falkland Islands, which had been invaded by Argentina.\n\nThatcher, who never forgot the debt of gratitude, later, spoke out against the “callous and unjust” decision to place her “true friend” under house arrest in England for human rights violations in 1998.\n\nJoe Biden and John McCain\n\n(Image credit: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)\n\nThe late Republican senator John McCain shared a close friendship with President Joe Biden while they served together in the US Senate. Their close friendship over party lines was evident at McCain’s funeral where Biden paid a loving tribute to the late politician, stating: “I’m a Democrat. And I loved John McCain.”\n\nTheir friendship “seems to have affected policymaking” too, said CNN. Biden and McCain were seen to be in an “emotional discussion” before McCain cast a critical vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2017, one of three Republicans to do so.\n\nBill Clinton and George Bush Snr\n\n“If anyone had a right to despise Bill Clinton,” it was “the man he kicked out of the White House”, wrote Jacob Hess for Deseret News.\n\nInstead, the two formed an unlikely friendship sparked by a generous note left by George Bush Snr to his successor on entering the White House. It read: “You will be our president when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck, George.”\n\nClinton would later call their friendship “one of the great joys of my life” and upon the death of the former Republican president said: “I just loved him.”\n\nBill Clinton and George Bush Snr\n\n(Image credit: Bettmann/Getty Images)\n\nThe friendship between Canada’s former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro was one that was “marred” by the Western world’s isolationist policies towards communist Cuba, said MSN.com.\n\nIn 1976, Trudeau visited Havana with the aim of normalising relations with the island nation, despite the meeting drawing criticism from members of the Canadian public. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were never severed, with Castro attending Trudeau’s funeral in 2000.\n\nUpon Castro’s death in 2016, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau warmly recalled his late father’s friendship with the Cuban leader and paid tribute to a “remarkable leader” in words that Reuters called “markedly more positive” than those of most Western leaders who “either condemned the revolutionary leader’s human rights record or tiptoed around the subject”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "Elliott Goat", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/opinions/boris-johnson-ukraine-eu-brexit-kiley/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Don't be fooled by Boris Johnson's backing of Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sam Kiley is CNN’s Senior International Correspondent.

Right too when he described Ukraine as being on a “knife-edge” during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit in Bavaria this week.\n\nWhich is odd. Because Johnson has two things in common with Putin that serve the Russian president’s strategic aims far more than his support for Ukraine threatens them.\n\nUkrainians are dying for the right to join the European Union – an international body Johnson fought to leave, and that Putin’s worked hard to undermine.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky walk through Kyiv during a meeting in April. Ukrainian Presidency/Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nUkrainians are also seeking the protections afforded by international law – the rules-based global order that Johnson is proudly tearing apart – not unlike the former KGB boss who now runs Russia and who illegally annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe country that has stood up to Putin’s invasion is now feeding its young into a Russian meat grinder that’s slowly chewing its way into territory in the east.\n\nSoldiers – both Ukrainians and foreign volunteers – repeat with ever more anxious voices, that Ukraine is losing its best men. That Russia’s sheer mass is prevailing and above all it needs NATO’s best weapons – and yesterday.\n\nJohnson’s been telling his own nation what “we must steel ourselves for a long war, as Putin resorts to a campaign of attrition, trying to grind down Ukraine by sheer brutality,” in a recent Sunday Times article.\n\nThe British Prime Minister has made two pilgrimages to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, where he’s promised arms, money, and unwavering diplomatic support for President Volodomyr Zelensky.\n\n“The price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his program of conquest, that price will be far, far higher. Everybody here understands that,” Johnson said in an interview on the sidelines of the G7 summit.\n\nUkrainians, he said, are facing real pressures, they’re having to source energy from elsewhere, but they’re doing it and making the effort and making the sacrifice. That’s because they see that the “price for the freedom is worth paying,” he added.\n\nJohnson has long sought to channel Second World War-era British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. But he’s convincing very few, no matter how welcome he’s made in Kyiv, that he understands that many of the freedoms Ukrainians seek lie within the EU.\n\nIn 2016, Johnson galvanized support for leaving the EU with a mendacious campaign that pledged, erroneously, that £350 billion ($425 billion) of money sent to Europe would come back into the Bank of England.\n\nJohnson promised “sunlit uplands” for the green and pleasant land. But today the sceptered isle is more septic island. The freedom to work anywhere in the bloc – one now lost to Britons. The freedom of access to a market of half a billion people, now also lost to Britons.\n\nFor years Johnson, the disheveled political magus, was the golden boy of Britain’s Conservative Party. A favorite of comedy shows; the faux bumbling of Johnson delivered Brexit and a landslide general election win.\n\nAccording to his sister, Rachel, a young Johnson said he wanted to be “world king.” As an adult he’s had to settle his ambitions at being Britain’s head of government. And he stopped at very little to achieve that aim.\n\nBut in June Johnson’s political crown slipped over face when his Conservative party was wiped out in two by-elections.\n\nHe has survived one vote within his party to unseat him. But may soon face another as Tory back benchers are reportedly trying to change the rules – meaning he could be kicked out in another confidence vote inside 12 months.\n\nThese domestic travails may explain his passionate interest in Ukraine. But he’s studiously avoided any mention of the essence of its fight with Russia which is, deep down, Ukraine’s desire to join the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile Britain is struggling with the near implosion of an airline industry facing cancellations of international flights and luggage mountains at Heathrow Airport. The legal system is in disarray as barristers go on strike over claims that their net earnings are below the UK’s minimum wage. Railway workers have staged walk outs and threatened more. Teachers too are on the verge of taking action as inflation surges ahead of wage increases.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says the UK economy will grow at 3.6% this year and not at all next year. Only Russia will do worse, the 38-country organization says in its latest report. It’s shrinking at 4.1%. But it has the expenses of invading Ukraine and the consequences of punitive international sanctions to blame.\n\nBritain’s economic malaise can’t all be blamed on Brexit. Global growth has slowed due to Russia’s “unprovoked aggression” the OECD says. It’s slumped to 3% this year and is expected to dwindle to 2.8% in 2023. Covid-19 has taken its toll too.\n\nBut the UK’s GDP growth was the highest in the G7 a little over a year ago.\n\nIts slide to 19 out of 20 in the OECD rankings of G20 countries must be partly attributable to the supply chain chaos, slowed trade, shortage of labor across the board and decline in investment which has followed Brexit.\n\nFor all his crowing about being the prime minister to break the political deadlock and “Get Brexit Done,” Johnson’s government has failed to secure a trade deal with Brussels.\n\nOn top of that his government has published a bill that will tear up the one deal it has managed to do with the EU, the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Johnson himself negotiated and signed.\n\nDoing so will almost certainly breach international law. Plans to impose tariffs on steel imports to the UK risk breaking World Trade Organization Rules. And risks a trade war with steel-producing China, India and Turkey.\n\nIncensed by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which stopped Britain sending asylum seekers from England to Rwanda, Johnson’s government is now threatening to leave its jurisdiction.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO), the child of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was a very British vision. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a British-EU treaty intended to secure the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to Northern Ireland.\n\nRipping into the fabric of these contracts undermines Britain’s standing in the world.\n\nA British Prime Minister’s threat to leave the ECHR, a court the British helped set up to establish a pan-European legal system to prevent atrocities in Europe in the wake of the Second World War, must seem bizarre to Ukrainians.\n\nThey’d no doubt love a bit of ECHR right now.\n\nUkrainian investigators will seek the help of international organizations to pursue alleged war criminals. It’s as committed to joining international organizations like the EU as Johnson is to leaving them.\n\nIndeed it’s Ukraine’s desire to join the EU that provoked the revolution against pro-Putin anti-EU president Victor Yanukovich in 2014.\n\nThat same desire is probably the biggest reason for Putin’s invasion. Though his stated excuse for a brazen abuse of international law was to “de-Nazify” Ukraine and stop the country joining NATO.\n\nBut a democratic, free, EU member state on Putin’s doorstep with a substantial Russian-speaking population is the sort of personal existential threat that must conjure up the images of Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Gadhafi’s ignominious demise. No dictator wants to end their rule with a bayonet up the backside.\n\n“We all know the Ukrainians are willing to die for the European perspective.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave an impassioned, history-making speech, casting the war in Ukraine as part of an epochal struggle between democracy and autocracy. “This is the task of our time, the task of this generation.” It was the culmination of a trip in which he built up the West’s response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault. He linked Putin’s attack on a democratic neighbor to events we have seen elsewhere, as “the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe.” Strikingly, he concluded his speech declaring, “For God’s sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power!”\n\nBiden’s mission in Europe this week had one overarching purpose: prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from winning his war in Ukraine. And do it without triggering Putin’s worst instincts, which could turn the war in Ukraine into the prelude to something even more catastrophic. But Biden’s Warsaw speech showed he believes Putin’s defeat can reverse the autocratic tide washing across the world in recent years.\n\nFrida Ghitis CNN\n\nIt’s a tightrope walk requiring exquisite balance. We will not know if Biden has succeeded immediately, but what is clear is that Biden is moving forward – something that cannot be said about Putin’s forces stuck in Ukraine. And as Biden explains his plan and enlists European support for it, his tone has been light on arrogance and unwavering in conviction.\n\nFor months, Biden has maintained that the right approach to handling this crisis is to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, rally America’s allies and the international community and call out Putin’s violations. He has done all this while trying to keep the United States and NATO out of direct combat with Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s military machine is bombing and killing civilians by the hundreds, striking hospitals and health care facilities, residential buildings and civilian shelters. The suffering of the Ukrainian people is unimaginable. But Putin, so far, is not achieving his objectives.\n\nWhat Putin wanted was evident in a Russian state-owned news agency editorial declaring victory, published seemingly by accident and then quickly taken down. A few days after the war started, it announced that the West’s “global domination” is over, and “Ukraine has returned to Russia.” No such thing has happened.\n\nThe challenges for Biden and the West are not getting any easier. The worse Putin’s forces perform, the more dangerous the Russian leader becomes. Strongmen cannot survive if they look weak. Putin’s two decades in power were built on his brutal crushing of a rebellion in Chechnya – followed by other muscular displays at home and abroad. His very legitimacy depends on achieving victory.\n\nNow, US intelligence believes a frustrated Putin may be planning to use chemical or biological weapons. Worse, the Kremlin’s spokesman refused to deny that Russia would use nuclear weapons if the nation faced an existential threat. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nRemember, Louis XIV’s “L’etat, c’est moi” (“the state, it is me”)? Hyper-powerful dictators think they are the state. If Putin feels an existential threat against himself, how far would he go?\n\nIn meetings in Brussels with NATO, the G-7 and European Union officials, and later in Poland, where US troops are deployed near the Ukraine border, Biden built on his multi-pronged strategy – more and better weapons for Ukraine; stronger and larger military forces on NATO soil; tighter, more effective economic sanctions against Russia; and expanded support for Ukrainians fleeing the fighting. As the veteran writer George Will described it, Biden “has orchestrated a symphony of sanctions and weapons deliveries.”\n\nThe most recent instrument is a plan to wean Europe off Russian oil and gas, which as Biden said, Russia uses to “coerce and manipulate its neighbors” and to “drive his war machine.” Any US effort to help Europe reduce its dependence on Russia is not only right “from a moral standpoint,” he said, but “it’s going to put us on a stronger strategic footing.”\n\nOf course, Biden could have said the same thing about the entire effort to defeat Russia’s campaign against Ukraine and the West.\n\nRussia’s neighbors, those in and out of NATO, are justifiably nervous. Putin’s aim is almost cosmic. He wants to turn back time, restore former Soviet territories to Moscow’s control and reinstate Russia’s sphere of influence. His neighbors have experienced life under the Kremlin’s boot. They want to keep their independence.\n\nFor now, instead of capturing Ukraine, Russia is bogged down in what looks like a strategic disaster of historic proportions. Many of us warned Putin was miscalculating, that his plans could go awry. But one month is not a long time. Wars that appeared to be won in the early days were later lost (ask anyone who fought in Afghanistan, for the Soviets or later for NATO).\n\nAnd yet, there’s something that is unquestionably going well for those who want to stop Putin. One month into the war, Russian forces are losing troops at a rapid pace and are struggling to maintain their gains in Ukraine.\n\nThe credit, above all, goes to Ukrainians; their fighters, their leaders – President Volodymyr Zelensky’s rallying of his nation and the international community – and everyday people who have worked to defend their country and support those who have left.\n\nBut Ukraine has been able to push back against one of the world’s biggest military forces in large part because it has received such massive resources from the West, led by the United States. It was US intelligence that displayed for the world Russia’s preparations to invade, and its designs to create a pretext for an attack. It is America, and its NATO allies, that have sent rivers of weapons to help Ukrainians strike their attackers. Ukraine needs more, of course, as Zelensky relentlessly, understandably, demands.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBiden’s strategy has not only helped in Ukraine’s defense, it has also helped turn this debacle into a geopolitical catastrophe for Putin by showing without ambiguity that Russia, led by a dictator, is clearly the aggressor against a fledgling democratic country trying to remain free.\n\nAmerican presidents have traveled to Europe for decades with the purpose – with one notorious exception – of touting the strength and unity of the Western alliance. This trip was different. Biden arrived during a raging war on the European continent, amid threats of nuclear attacks and with millions of refugees flooding out of Ukraine.\n\nStriding gingerly, Biden showed the US is still, or again, the unquestioned leader of the free world. That very term, “free world,” which only recently seemed an anachronism, has now been revived by an aggressive Russian leader bent on restoring a fallen empire. His megalomania may well be thwarted with crucial help from an American President who remembers the old days well enough to know it has to be stopped.", "authors": ["Frida Ghitis"], "publish_date": "2022/03/25"}]}

The resulting “kilonova” explosion sent ripples through space-time and hurtled heavy metals like platinum and gold into space. Now, astronomers have detected the signals from that long-ago collision, in the form of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals.\n\n“So first, on Aug. 17, early on, we heard more than a hundred seconds of gravitational waves coming from the end spiral, the death spiral of a pair of neutron stars,” says Vicky Kalogera, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. “They were going one around the other until they came so close that they actually collided.”\n\nFirst came the gravitational waves, she explains. Then, just two seconds later, scientists detected a flood of waves arriving from across the electromagnetic spectrum. “It started with gamma rays, the most energetic light we have, and continued with optical light,” she adds, “also later X-rays and eventually radio waves that continued over hours, days and weeks.”\n\nOther science and space news:\n\nA galaxy almost as old as the Big Bang itself was just discovered\n\nRats!? Fossils of mankind's earliest ancestor discovered in England\n\nThe U.S. is now the only country not part of Paris climate agreement after Syria signs on\n\nThe discovery was announced in October alongside a flurry of scientific papers documenting the findings. In the past, LIGO scientists have recorded gravitational waves from merging black holes, but this is the first time gravitational waves have been detected alongside electromagnetic signals from the same source. “There is an incredible range of new science here and it's really hard to pick out what's most exciting,” says University of Chicago astrophysicist Daniel Holz, also a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.Scientific Collaboration.\n\n“I mean, we learn about the speed of gravitational waves, we've now learned that the speed of gravity is the same as the speed of light,” he says. “We've learned where the gold and the platinum in the universe is made, or at least a good fraction of it. We've also been able to measure the scale of the universe in a whole new way.”\n\nAs he explains, scientists have long theorized that gravitational waves move at the speed of light, but the waves from this collision finally confirmed it. “We showed that gamma rays and gravitational waves … after traveling for over 100 million years, they arrived at Earth within two seconds of each other,” he says.\n\nLikewise, take a hard look at any jewelry you’re wearing and consider that for a long time, we haven’t had a good explanation for where heavy metals like gold and platinum come from. According to Holz, the Big Bang explains the creation of some lighter elements like hydrogen and helium. “And then those elements form stars, and the stars burn and produce heavier elements, and that story works all the way to iron … but not past iron,” he says.\n\nBut when scientists measured the light from the neutron star collision, Holz says they found the “signatures” of heavier elements like gold and platinum being produced and spewed into the cosmos. “And so we’re actually watching the movie of the formation of that gold and platinum,” he adds. That means the gold in your wedding band or necklace chain may have been forged by a long-ago neutron star collision in our own Milky Way. “That gold exists in the gas that surrounds the sun,” Kalogera says. “It becomes planets, it goes into our mountains and we get it in the mines and we make our jewelry and our watches. But it's not made in the Earth. It pre-exists.”\n\nIn fact, scientists estimate the recently discovered neutron star collision spewed out 200 times the mass of Earth — just in gold. But collectors, fear not: The metal is still precious, as is the event that made it. “In a galaxy like our own, these collisions maybe happen a dozen times, maybe a few dozen times per millions of years,” Kalogera says.\n\nBut beyond gold, there’s another aspect of the discovery that has Holz particularly excited. He says information gleaned from the collision is giving scientists a new way of measuring the expansion of the universe.\n\n“By using this event, by the fact that we've detected it both in gravitational waves and in light, we can do an absolutely unique sort of measurement that we've talked about and we've wanted to do for a long time, but we've never been able to do before,” he says. “And now we've done it, and we can measure this expansion, how quickly the universe is expanding around us right now. And by doing that, we get an overall sense of the scale of the universe and the age of the universe. And it's just, it's beautiful.”\n\nThe measurement still has some errors, but Holz is undeterred. “It's the very first time we've done it, but it's consistent with what we've known before and the whole picture just kind of fits together. And that's remarkable because we've never been able to do this before. And yet, it all kind of works.”\n\nThis article is based on an interview that aired on PRI’s Science Friday with Ira Flatow.\n\nThis article originally appeared on PRI.org.

But outside of our home galaxy? The number of stars is near unfathomable.\n\nYet getting a handle on observing stars, which form in large molecular clouds of gas and dust, is crucial to better understand not only how they evolve, but how our universe grows and changes with them, astronomers say.\n\nTo do that, what's the harm of adding just one more \"star\" to the mix – even if it's a humanmade one?\n\nIn a $19.5 million NASA-funded mission, researchers at George Mason University are heading a project to construct and eventually launch a small satellite into space. Once in orbit, the contraption will be far enough away to look like a star to telescopes back on Earth.\n\nThe satellite will then begin the work of helping researchers study star brightness to gain more precise estimates of their size, scale and age. By doing so, the researchers hope to uncover fresh clues about how fast the universe is expanding and, just maybe, whether life could exist anywhere else in the universe.\n\n“It might impact and change the way we measure or understand the properties of stars, surface temperatures and the habitability of exoplanets,\" said Eliad Peretz of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who is the mission's deputy principal investigator.\n\nHere's a look inside NASA's plan to launch an \"artificial star\" over the U.S. before the end of the decade.\n\nArtificial star will be visible to ground telescopes\n\nThe purpose of the so-named Landolt NASA Space Mission is to place a calibrated light source into orbit at a distance of 22,236 miles from the Earth.\n\nThe satellite, or \"artificial star,\" that the astronomers shoot into orbit won't be big enough, bright enough or close enough for skygazers to detect with the naked eye, but it should be visible to anyone with a telescope. Named for late astronomer Arlo Landolt, who created a renowned star catalog, the satellite will then spend its inaugural year in space moving at the same speed as Earth's rotation, keeping it positioned over the United States.\n\nIn technical terms, the small satellite is what's called a CubeSat, which is a a class of nanosatellites. Equipping the device with a cache of eight lasers will allow it to provide consistent observations on brightness levels of millions of stars to mission control on George Mason's campus in Fairfax, Virginia and other observatories.\n\nBy providing data that ground-based telescopes cannot, the artificial star should be able to refine the accuracy of measuring stellar brightness levels of nearby stars and even distant supernovae in far-away galaxies, Peter Plavchan, an astronomer at George Mason University, explained in a paper on the project.\n\n\"The Landolt mission will allow us to re-calibrate the brightnesses of millions of stars,\" Plavchan, the mission's primary investigator, wrote. \"Such measurements can only be achieved by a space-based orbiting artificial star.\"\n\nGeorge Mason leading $19.5 million Landolt NASA Space Mission\n\nNASA, which recently approved the mission for deployment as part of the space agency's Pioneers program, is providing the funding.\n\nWhile $19.5 million is relatively low-cost in terms of space missions, the green light represents a major first for George Mason, which will build and operate the mission for NASA.\n\nBut the university won't be doing it alone.\n\nAlong with NASA, George Mason will also partner with the National Institute of Standards and Technology – a U.S. Department of Commerce agency – as well as 10 other universities to develop the satellite.\n\n“This is an incredibly exciting opportunity for George Mason and our students,\" said Peter Pachowicz, an engineering associate professor at George Mason who is part of the Landolt mission, in a statement. \"Our team will design, build, and integrate the payload, which, because it’s going very high into geostationary orbit, must handle incredible challenges.”\n\nNASA will provide management and oversight of Landolt, which is already part of the space agency's fleet chart, by hosting reviews in the coming years amid key decision points, Plavchan told USA TODAY. He added that he and other mission operators will also provide monthly briefings to NASA.\n\nA specific launch vehicle will not be selected for another two-and-a-half years, Plavchan said. And because the Landolt satellite will be relatively small, the craft will have to hitch a ride to orbit via a private space company with the launch of either a bigger satellite or a set of small satellites, he added.\n\nUnderstanding more about habitable planets\n\nThe Landolt mission is not just one of a characterizing the brightness of stars. As the satellite gazes into the endless expanse of outer space, astronomers hope to learn about distant terrestrial worlds that could harbor life.\n\nAstronomers have long been interested in so-called habitable zones and the abundance of ocean worlds theorized to exist throughout the cosmos. Next month, NASA is on the cusp of launching its own largest planetary craft to date to study Jupiter's moon Europa to see if the vast ocean beneath its surface hold clues to how life could exist beyond our own planet.\n\nBy gathering data on stellar evolution, the Landolt mission may play a vital role in helping identify habitable zones where planets could have water, providing a key ingredient for life to flourish. In a nod to the classic fairy tale, astronomers even refer to these regions as \"Goldilocks\" zones because conditions have to be just right – neither too hot nor too cold – for water to remain in liquid form and pool on planetary surfaces.\n\nWhile finding evidence of life on another planet would be monumental, it's a tricky business: One that requires diligence and an abundance of evidence to determine, for instance, if a star gives off enough energy or if a planet is close enough to support life, explained Jamie Tayar, an astronomer at the University of Florida, a partner on the Landolt mission.\n\n“There are so many big questions in astronomy: How did we get here? Are there other planets like ours? Do aliens exist?” Tayar said in a statement. “But those are really hard questions, and so to answer them the measurements have to be really good, and they have to be right.”\n\nThe team hopes to launch the \"artificial star\" into orbit by 2029.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMeasuring the expansion rate of the universe was one of the Hubble Space Telescope’s main goals when it was launched in 1990.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the space observatory has helped scientists discover and refine that accelerating rate – as well as uncover a mysterious wrinkle that only brand-new physics may solve.\n\nHubble has observed more than 40 galaxies that include pulsating stars as well as exploding stars called supernovae to measure even greater cosmic distances. Both of these phenomena help astronomers to mark astronomical distances like mile markers, which have pointed to the expansion rate.\n\nIn the quest to understand how quickly our universe expands, astronomers already made one unexpected discovery in 1998: “dark energy.” This phenomenon acts as a mysterious repulsive force that accelerates the expansion rate.\n\nAnd there is another twist: an unexplained difference between the expansion rate of the local universe versus that of the distant universe right after the big bang.\n\nScientists don’t understand the discrepancy, but acknowledge that it’s weird and could require new physics.\n\n“You are getting the most precise measure of the expansion rate for the universe from the gold standard of telescopes and cosmic mile markers,” said Nobel Laureate Adam Riess at the Space Telescope Science Institute and a distinguished professor at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in a statement.\n\n“This is what the Hubble Space Telescope was built to do, using the best techniques we know to do it. This is likely Hubble’s magnum opus, because it would take another 30 years of Hubble’s life to even double this sample size.”\n\nDecades of observation\n\nThe telescope was named for pioneering astronomer Edwin Hubble, who discovered in the 1920s that distant clouds in the universe were actually galaxies. (He died in 1953.)\n\nHubble relied on the work of astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt’s 1912 discovery of the periods of brightness in pulsating stars called Cepheid variables. Cepheids act like cosmic mile markers as they brighten and dim periodically within our galaxy and others.\n\nHubble’s work led to the revelation that our galaxy was one of many, forever changing our perspective and place in the universe. The astronomer continued his work and discovered that distant galaxies appeared to be moving rapidly, suggesting that we live in an expanding universe that started with a big bang.\n\nThe detection of the universe’s expansion rate helped lead to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt and Riess “for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant supernovae.”\n\nRiess continues to lead SHOES, short for Supernova, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark Energy, a scientific collaboration investigating the universe’s expansion rate. His team is publishing a paper in The Astrophysical Journal that provides the latest update on the Hubble constant, as the expansion rate is known.\n\nAn unresolved discrepancy\n\nMeasuring distant objects has created a “cosmic distance ladder” that can help scientists better estimate the age of the universe and understand its foundations.\n\nMultiple teams of astronomers using the Hubble telescope have arrived at a Hubble constant value that equals 73 plus or minus 1 kilometer per second per megaparsec. (A megaparsec is one million parsecs, or 3.26 million light years.)\n\n“The Hubble constant is a very special number. It can be used to thread a needle from the past to the present for an end-to-end test of our understanding of the universe. This took a phenomenal amount of detailed work,” said Licia Verde, a cosmologist at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies and the Institute of Cosmos Science at the University of Barcelona, in a statement.\n\nBut the actual predicted expansion rate of the universe is slower than what the Hubble telescope has observed, according to astronomers utilizing the standard cosmological model of the universe (a theory suggesting the components of the big bang) and measurements taken by the European Space Agency’s Planck mission between 2009 and 2013.\n\nPlanck, another space observatory, was used to measure the cosmic microwave background, or the leftover radiation from the big bang 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nPlanck mission scientists arrived at a Hubble constant of 67.5 plus or minus 0.5 kilometers per second per megaparsec.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in December, will be able to observe Hubble’s mile markers in sharper resolution and at greater distances, which could contribute to understanding the discrepancy between the two numbers.\n\nIt makes for an exciting challenge to cosmologists who were once determined to measure the Hubble constant – and now find themselves questioning what additional physics may help them unlock a new mystery about the universe.\n\n“Actually, I don’t care what the expansion value is specifically, but I like to use it to learn about the universe,” Riess said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/theme-parks/2024/08/01/universal-epic-universe-theme-park-guide/74631803007/", "title": "Epic Universe guide: What we know about Universal's new theme park", "text": "Think of an event you’re excited about.

Universal is creating five incredibly detailed, fully immersive worlds at Epic Universe, which promise to make even casual park goers forget about the reality they left behind in the parking lot.\n\nHere’s everything you should know about Epic Universe.\n\nWhat is confirmed for Epic Universe?\n\nUniversal says there will be more than 50 unique experiences across the park’s five worlds. Here are some highlights of each.\n\nCelestial Park will be the first world guests encounter at Epic Universe as well as the gateway to the park’s other four worlds. “It’s where we put the park back into theme park,” Universal Destinations and Experiences President and CEO Mark Woodbury said in the same video as Spielberg. It will feature tranquil gardens, dancing fountains guests can splash in, a heavenly Constellation Carousel, and a dual-launch racing roller coaster boasting 5,000 feet of track and speeds up to 62 miles per hour.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk will invite guests into the world of its namesake DreamWorks Animation franchise. Set between the events of the second and third films, “We call this the golden age of harmony between Vikings and dragons,” a Universal Creative team member said in a video introducing the world. Guests will be able to meet Toothless and ride three attractions, including high-flying Dragon Racer’s Rally, which lets guests control how wild they want their swooping and spinning ride to be. There will be an interactive play area for Junior Vikings and a highly anticipated live show called “The Untrainable Dragon,” inspired by the wildly popular “Untrainable” show at Universal Beijing Resort.\n\nSuper Nintendo World will not be a carbon copy of its sister land at Universal Studios Hollywood. In addition to the augmented reality-infused Mario Kart: Bowser’s Challenge, its Super Mario Land will feature the family ride Yoshi’s Adventure for the first time in the U.S. In another domestic first, there will also be a Donkey Kong Country with a roller coaster that appears to jump the track.\n\nDark Universe will lean into Universal’s legacy of classic monsters like Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. There are two rides planned for the land. Universal is calling Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment its “most terrifying attraction yet.” It will also be one of the most high tech. “We literally use every technology I could possibly think of, and then we realized we needed to invent new technology,” Gregory Hall, Assistant Director, Creative Design for Universal Creative said in a Dark Universe video.\n\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic will bridge 1920s wizarding Paris from the Fantastic Beasts movie franchise and the British Ministry of Magic from the Harry Potter films. “You’re going to see what you saw in the films at full scale,” Anisha Vyas Burgos, Assistant Director, Projects for Universal Creative, said in a video on the Ministry of Magic. Guests can also see Universal's first full scale theater show within the Wizarding World, Le Cirque Arcanus, before riding Harrry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, a cutting-edge attraction that pits Harry, Ron and Hermione against Dolores Umbridge and Death Eaters once again.\n\nWhere is Epic Universe located?\n\nEpic Universe will be located off Sand Lake Road, which Universal describes as a 10 to 15-minute trip away from its existing theme parks. Free resort transportation will be provided between the parks. It will also be available between Epic Universe and Universal hotels.\n\nOrlando vs. Hollywood:What's the difference between Universal theme parks?\n\nIs Epic Universe bigger than Universal’s other parks?\n\nYes. It will be the largest theme park at Universal Orlando.\n\n“Epic Universe represents a tremendous addition, almost doubling the size of Universal Orlando Resort,” Woodbury said. “This gives us the opportunity to bring people to Universal Orlando for an entire week of the most incredible experiences they can imagine.”\n\nWhat month does Epic Universe open?\n\nEpic Universe will open on May 22, 2025.\n\nGuests who can’t wait can get a sneak peek at the Epic Universe Preview Center in Universal Orlando’s CityWalk shopping, dining and entertainment complex. It’s open to the public and doesn’t require a park ticket.\n\nThere’s a sprawling model of the park and an accompanying augmented reality app that lets you interact with the model and learn more about the park through your smartphone. There are also a few photo opportunities and Epic Universe souvenirs available.\n\nEpic Universe tickets\n\nUniversal has not yet revealed the pricing for single-day Epic Universe tickets for the general public, nor what annual passes will look like with the new park.\n\nCurrently, only annual pass members may purchase specially priced single-day tickets, which, for them, start at $122 and vary by date.\n\nFor now, the general public may only purchase multi-day tickets with only one of those days at Epic Universe.\n\nWill there be a hotel at Epic Universe?\n\nThere will be three Universal hotels near the park, all part of Loews, like the other hotels on property.\n\nUniversal Stella Nova Resort will open on Jan. 21, 2025. Its sister property Universal Terra Luna Resort will open on March 25. They’ll both be Prime Value Hotels, like Universal Cabana Bay Beach Resort and Universal Aventura Hotel.\n\nA third resort called Universal Helios Grand Hotel will be adjacent to Epic Universe's Celestial Park and have its own special entrance. It will be a Signature Collection hotel, like Hard Rock Hotel and Loews Sapphire Falls Resort. Reservations are open for Helios Grand stays beginning May 22, 2025.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information and to clarify the new park's size.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2018/06/02/non-binary-gender-meaning-column/659244002/", "title": "I am the parent of a non-binary child. Here's what that means.", "text": "Susan Knoppow\n\nDetroit Free Press Opinion\n\nThe first time my oldest child told me that gender existed on a spectrum, we were parked in the driveway, sitting in our old Honda minivan with the engine idling and the radio off. Miriam had just returned from a youth group weekend and we were catching up.\n\n“No, sweetheart,” I said to my precocious 14-year-old. “Sexuality is on a spectrum; you can be straight, gay or lots of things in between. Gender is either male or female.”\n\nMiriam corrected me. “No, Mom. Gender is on a spectrum, too.”\n\nAt the end of high school, Miriam came out as non-binary. That, too, was a confusing surprise. My husband David and I listened intently, nodded in all the right places, and said we would do everything we could to be supportive. We had no idea what that meant. I would be lying if I pretended it has been easy.\n\nChanging pronouns\n\nFor the first 18 years of Miriam’s life, I was sure I was raising a daughter. And I was. Until that daughter told me they were neither female or male, and that I should switch to “they/them/their” pronouns when referring to them in the third person.\n\nMore:Trump cannot hold back progress with a tweet: Transgender Veteran\n\nMore:Gender is reality: Chicks on the Right\n\nPronouns need their own discussion. We’ll save that for another day. But in the meantime, here’s the short version: People who are non-binary use a variety of pronouns, but they/them/their are the most common today. The English language is still figuring this one out. My child (and many other non-binary folks) use they instead of she or he, them instead of her or him, and their instead of hers or his.\n\nAfter lots of practice, my ear is getting tuned to this change. The distinctions may seem like a clumsy trick of the English language, but the implications run deep.\n\nThe pronouns we use reflect our level of respect for the person we are speaking with or about. When someone tells me, “I’ll just call Miriam ‘she’ because that’s what I’m used to,” they are passing judgment on my child. They are saying, “My comfort is more important than your child’s comfort.” Whether or not they intend to be dismissive they are telling me, “Miriam’s identity is not valid because I don’t understand it.” Being mis-gendered — or mistaken for the wrong gender — stings. Hearing “she/her/hers” instead of “they/them/theirs” causes my child pain.\n\nDoes that sound harsh? Does it sound like I’m asking friends, family and strangers to engage in an issue that doesn’t involve them? I can assure you that whether or not you think you know someone who is non-binary, you do. The more people I talk to and the more I write about this, the more I realize that David and I are experiencing something that is both utterly unique and increasingly common. You know someone who is non-binary. They just might not have told you yet.\n\nAs a parent, I am doing everything I can to expand the universe in which my child and other non-binary people can feel comfortable. That’s what an ally does. I’ve had conversations about gender identity with my parents and with cab drivers, with my closest friends and with checkout clerks. When someone I haven’t seen for months asks, “How’s Miriam?” I say, “They’re fine, thanks.” When a business associate asks, “You have three kids? Boys or girls?” I tell them, “I have two sons, and my oldest is non-binary.” Some people nod because they get it. Most of the time, I have to explain further.\n\nMore:Dear America, if I can adapt to my transgender child, you can too\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nHere’s a peek into the types of questions and reactions I've heard from friends, relatives and strangers when I mention Miriam or talk about what’s been going on in our lives, along with my responses.\n\nDo you think it’s a phase?\n\nNo. And even if it were, what difference would that make? I want to keep the lines of communication open and help my child find a comfortable home in the world — with or without me. If I deny their reality, I will be shutting that door.\n\nWhat you are describing is scientifically impossible. There are two sexes: male and female, and therefore two genders.\n\nThat’s not helpful. And anyway, I’m talking about gender, not biological sex. Gender has always been a social construct (which changes by era and culture.) Some say sex is constructed, too.\n\nThis is just kids’ latest way to try to be unique. They’ll grow out of it.\n\nThe fact that many of the people who (publicly) identify as non-binary happen to be under 25 does not mean this gender identity doesn’t exist for older people. They may not have had the language or the need for it, or they just might not be sharing it with you. Wait a few years until non-binary is more familiar to the mainstream public. You'll be hearing more of this.\n\nMy child says the same thing. I think it’s because she’s depressed.\n\nIf you think your child is depressed, I encourage you to get them help to deal with that directly. Please don’t deny your child’s identity.\n\nI’m so sorry. I feel terrible for you.\n\nKeep your pity to yourself. It is both misguided and unwelcome. As soon as you smugly think to yourself, “Thank God it’s not my kid” you separate yourself from my family and isolate us from the larger community. Please deal with your discomfort away from me.\n\nYou are amazing (brave/courageous/etc.). I couldn’t possibly handle this.\n\nAnnoying and unhelpful. See “I’m so sorry,” above.\n\nThat’s ridiculous. “They” is a plural pronoun.\n\nLanguage is always evolving. You’ll get used to it.\n\nCan’t you just use “they” when you’re together and use the old pronoun with everyone else?\n\nLanguage matters, and I have been asked to change mine. The best way to get used to that change is to use the preferred pronouns all the time. The more others hear “they” in reference to one person, the more familiar it will become, and the more welcome and comfortable my child (and other non-binary folks) will be in our communities.\n\nI hear you. We’re having the same conversation in my house.\n\nLet’s talk.\n\nI am completely confused.\n\nThat’s OK. You don’t have to get it all at once.\n\nI love my child. They are exactly the same artsy, sensitive, insightful person they have always been – same concern for the world, same love of farming, poetry, Judaism and family, same funky sense of style. I keep exploring and sharing my experiences in my blog and in my daily encounters. It gets easier and more comfortable all the time.\n\nSusan Knoppow is CEO of Wow Writing Workshop, a communication and writing services company, and is author of the blog Writing it Down.

Maybe while you've been stuck in this rut, you have noticed the presence of repeating threes.\n\nThese repeating number sequences, or angel numbers, can be used as guides for deeper spiritual exploration as each numeral has its own significance.\n\nIn a conversation with Jenn King, cosmic numerologist, USA TODAY breaks down the number three, its angel number meaning and how it may affect your relationships and career.\n\nWhat are angel numbers? Beginner's guide to angel numbers and what they (could) mean.\n\nWhat does 333 mean?\n\nThe number three is associated with growth across the board. Whether it be spiritual, personal or financial growth, seeing the angel number 333 means this is your time to expand.\n\nIs it in the stars? Free Daily and Monthly Horoscopes\n\n\"Three encourages you to put energy into your own growth and expansion and your own journey, and where you want to be and where you'd like to be, and then encourages you to dream big,\" said King.\n\nIf you are seeing lots of repeating threes, it signals to aim high. In doing this, you can allow yourself to potentially reach all your goals.\n\n\"If you don't hit it, you'll get closer to it than if you limit yourself,\" said King. \"Try to go as far as you can go and let it become whatever it becomes.\"\n\nThe angel number 333 encourages to set plans into action and let your personal strength be the guide; to trust yourself and put thought into your choices. This angel number also is connected with optimism, creativity and intuition.\n\n\"It's a really nice reminder that you have influence, that you have agency, that you have power, and whatever you direct your energy, your thoughts, your emotions, your love into is going to grow,\" said King.\n\nWhat does 000 mean?Angel number meaning and symbolism for work, relationships and more\n\nWhat does 111 mean?Why you keep seeing it and how it will help you manifest your power.\n\nRelationships\n\nWhen it comes to the angel number 333, the energy of growth also plays a role in relationships, said King.\n\nAdditionally, the optimism associated with three calls to have positive outlook on who is in your life. This angel number is about generosity, and when you infuse this with your relationships, it can be a sign to put further effort into growing your connections.\n\n\"So that your relationships can grow, you can grow, the people you're connected with can grow and everyone grows to be great,\" said King. \"It benefits everyone.\"\n\nThe angel number 333 is not only about personal growth for your own needs or wants, but about growth to help and assist others and the world around you.\n\nWhat does 222 mean?Angel number meaning and symbolism in your life, love and career.\n\n'Phoenix energy':444 angel number meaning and its role in your life\n\nCareer\n\nWith career and the appearance of the angel number 333, think big and ask for more. \"If someone was thinking about a career move and wanting to climb the ladder, hit the top,\" said King.\n\nIf you've been working really hard and are eyeing a new promotion, put your name in the ring. Or maybe the company you've always dreamed of working for has an opening. Send in your resume and apply because you just may get an interview or the role all together.\n\n\"If you aim high, you just never know,\" said King. \"When you collaborate with that expansive growth energy, anything can happen, and anything is possible.\"\n\nWhat is your zodiac sign?Horoscopes, astrology, and what the stars says about you\n\nStrengths\n\nIn numerology, the number three is associated with Jupiter, which is considered the planet of good luck and blessings. The appearance of the angel number 333 highlights an energy of good vibes toward your journey.\n\nIf you are feeling restricted in your life and you are seeing a lot of threes, take it as a sign of encouragement, said King. Even if you are not in the best situation at this point in time, the angel number 333 is signaling growth and expansion on the horizon.\n\n\"Do what you can to grow whatever you've got going on, or whatever you'd like to have going on,\" she said. \"Having a bit of faith and having a bit of self belief goes a long way.\"\n\nA change is coming.What angel number 555 means for your relationships and work life.\n\nWhat does 777 mean?This is one angel number that means it might be time to slow down.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOn the flip side, the optimism associated with the angel number 333 has a tendency to lead to excessiveness, over-extravagance and living beyond you means, said King.\n\n\"That level of optimism can sometimes be an undoing too, if you're going too far,\" she said. As a result, be wary and mindful of your actions and \"take it as a warning to not gamble what you can't afford to lose.\"\n\nWhile the angel number 333 reminds to trust yourself and dream big, there must be a sense of balance. Set boundaries and foundations for yourself when it comes to taking risks. Do not throw complete caution to the wind.\n\nIf you take your angel number as a sign to make a big decision, such as investing or quitting your job, weigh all the implications of this choice.\n\n\"You also have to think 'Can I afford to lose this?' And if the answer is yes, then it's OK to take the risk,\" said King. \"But if the answer is no, then maybe look at growth in a way that is sustainable and not excessive.\"\n\nWhat does 888 mean?Its angel number meaning in relationships, career and life.\n\nWhat does 999 mean?Angel number meaning and symbolism for life, love and more.\n\nGet to know the angel numbers\n\n000 | 111 | 222 | 333 | 444 | 555 | 777 | 888 | 999", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/world/james-webb-space-telescope-new-images-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA reveals Webb telescope's new images of stars, galaxies and ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA stellar nursery where stars are born, interactions between galaxies and a unique view of an exoplanet are just some of the new cosmic images were shared Tuesday.\n\nAfter decades of waiting, it’s finally time for the world to see the first images taken by the most powerful space telescope ever – the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nDevelopment of the world’s premier space observatory began in 2004, and after years of delays, the telescope and its massive gold mirror finally launched on December 25.\n\nThe first glimpse of how the James Webb Space Telescope will change the way people see the universe has arrived.\n\nPresident Joe Biden released one of Webb’s first images on Monday, and it is “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” according to NASA. The rest of the high-resolution color images made their debut on Tuesday.\n\nThe space observatory can investigate the mysteries of the universe by observing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nWebb will peer into the very atmospheres of exoplanets, some of which are potentially habitable, and it could uncover clues in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth.\n\nThe telescope will also look at every phase of cosmic history, including the first glows after the big bang that created our universe and the formation of the galaxies, stars and planets that fill it today.\n\nNow, Webb is ready to help us understand the origins of the universe and begin to answer key questions about our existence, such as where we came from and if we’re alone in the cosmos.\n\nThe first images\n\nThe first image, released on Monday, shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. Called gravitational lensing, this created Webb’s first deep field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies.\n\nThe image of SMACS 0723 is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe image, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera, is composed of images taken at different wavelengths of light over a collective 12.5 hours. Deep field observations are lengthy observations of regions of the sky that can reveal faint objects.\n\nWebb’s other primary targets for the first image release included the Carina Nebula, WASP-96 b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan’s Quintet.\n\nWebb’s study of the giant gas planet WASP-96 b is the most detailed spectrum of an exoplanet to date. The spectrum includes different wavelengths of light that reveal new information about the planet and its atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96 b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured a spectrum of WASP-96 b. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nWebb’s spectrum includes “the distinct signature of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere surrounding a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a distant Sun-like star,” according to NASA.\n\nThe observation demonstrates “Webb’s unprecedented ability to analyze atmospheres hundreds of light-years away,” according to NASA.\n\nIn the future, Webb will capture actual images of known exoplanets while also searching for unknown planets, said Knicole Colón, Webb deputy project scientist for exoplanet science at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, during a news conference. And the spectrium of WASP-96 b is “barely scratching the surface of what we’re going to learn.”\n\nColón anticipates that scientists will determine just how much water is in the exoplanet’s atmosphere.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the “Eight-Burst,” is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star. Webb helped reveal previously hidden details about the nebula, which is a shell of gas and dust released by the dying star. The nebula’s second star can be seen in the Webb image, as well as how the stars shape the gas and dust cloud.\n\nNASA/ESA/STScl/Aura NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nThe second star is surrounded by dust while the brighter star, at an earlier stage of evolution, will release its own cloud of gas and dust later on. As the two stars orbit one another, they effectively “stir” the gas and dust, resulting in the patterns seen in the image.\n\nThe insights from images like this could help astronomers to unlock how stars change their environments as they evolve. Multi-colored points of light in the background represent galaxies.\n\nThe space telescope’s view of Stephan’s Quintet shows the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group “are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,” according to a NASA statement.\n\nNASA/ESA/Hubble SM4 ERO Team NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nIf you’ve ever watched “It’s a Wonderful Life,” you’ve seen Stephan’s Quintet. Now, Webb has revealed the galactic grouping in a new mosaic which is the telescope’s largest image to date.\n\n“The information from Webb provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe,” according to NASA.\n\nThe Stephan’s Quintet image provides a rare glimpse into how galaxies can trigger star formation in one another when they interact, as well as outflows driven by a black hole at a new level of detail.\n\nThe gravitational dance between these galaxies can be seen through tails of gas, dust and stars and even shock waves as one of the galaxies pushes through the cluster.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nNow, its “Cosmic Cliffs” are revealed in an incredible new Webb image.\n\nNASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nWebb’s ability to see through cosmic dust has revealed previously invisible areas of star birth within the nebula, which could provide new insight on the formation of stars. The earliest stages of star formation are harder to capture – but something Webb’s sensitivity can chronicle.\n\nWhat looks like a landscape in the image is really a massive gaseous cavity with “peaks” reaching 7 light-years high.\n\n“The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image,” according to NASA. And what looks like “steam” rising off the “mountains” is hot, energetic gas and dust.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm a little verklempt': Analyst breaks down stunning new Webb telescope images 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nA long future of observation\n\nThe mission, originally expected to last for 10 years, has enough excess fuel capability to operate for 20 years, according to NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.\n\nThese will be just the first of many images to come from Webb over the next two decades, which promises to fundamentally alter the way we understand the cosmos.\n\nWhile some of what Webb could reveal has been anticipated, the unknowns are just as exciting to scientists.\n\n“We don’t know what we don’t know yet,” said Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA Goddard. “I think it’s true that every time we launch a revolutionary instrument into space, like with Hubble, we learn things that completely surprise us but do cause us to sort of change our fundamental understanding of how the universe works.”\n\nHubble’s 31 years have yielded a wealth of discoveries that couldn’t be anticipated, and the scientific community views Webb and its capabilities in the same way.\n\nWhen comparing Webb’s first images to other breakthroughs in astronomy, Webb program scientist and NASA Astrophysics Division chief scientist Eric Smith compared it to seeing Hubble’s images after the telescope was repaired and everything snapped into focus.\n\n“A lot of people sometimes see pictures of space and they think it makes them feel small,” Smith said. “When I see these pictures, they make me feel powerful. A team of people can make this unbelievable instrument to find out things about the universe revealed here, and just seeing that pride in the team, and pride in humanity, that when we want to, we can do that.”\n\n“The universe has (always) been out there,” said Jane Rigby, Webb operations project scientist at NASA Goddard. “We just had to build a telescope to go see what was there. Yeah, very similar feeling of, maybe, people in a broken world managing to do something right and to see some of the majesty that is out there.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/02/09/hakes-how-solon-and-mount-vernon-reporters-are-adjusting-to-di-acquisition/72536404007/", "title": "Hakes: How Solon and Mount Vernon reporters are adjusting to DI ...", "text": "Richard Hakes\n\nSpecial to the Press-Citizen\n\nEditor Nathan Countryman is busier than usual, pounding a keyboard in front of twin computer screens at his desk in a back room of the downtown newspaper office in Mount Vernon.\n\nOn one wall are three walnut Iowa Newspaper Association (INA) plaques, won last year by the five-person staff at the weekly Mount Vernon-Lisbon Sun.\n\n“We’ll be getting five more awards this year,” Countryman tells me, contemplating this week’s INA convention.\n\nHe is clearly proud of this small weekly newspaper, its crew and the two communities they serve.\n\nCountryman also believes that all three entities will benefit from last week’s announcement that the University of Iowa student newspaper, the nationally prominent Daily Iowan, will purchase The Sun.\n\n“These are thriving communities,” he says. “They deserve a good newspaper.”\n\nJust 10 miles south is another thriving community, Solon, where Solon Economist Editor Chris Umscheid is likewise putting in extra hours.\n\nBoth weeklies are in the throes of transition to ownership by Student Publications, Inc. (SPI), the Iowa City non-profit that publishes the Daily Iowan, with strong support from the University of Iowa School of Journalism and Mass Communication.\n\nMore:The Daily Iowan acquires Mount Vernon, Solon weekly newspapers, expanding student opportunities\n\nAcquisition was a 'shocker'\n\nThe Dubuque-based Woodward Communications sale of these weeklies to a university student newspaper shocked many in the industry − including the two editors. It appears to be a pioneering move in the news and academics universe.\n\nShocking, also because most small-town weekly newspapers have been fighting a losing battle for two decades in the life-altering age of evolving Internet technology.\n\nIn fact, both Countryman and Umscheid feared their newspapers were shuttering when they were summoned to a recent mandatory Woodward company meeting.\n\nInstead, they found out they were being sold to a student newspaper.\n\nIt provided immediate relief, at least on the financial front. Both editors know firsthand the struggle to make a profit in a small weekly.\n\n\"You can only fund a deficit so long,” said Umscheid. “They (SPI) are saying some good things about retaining us and being committed to our communities. SPI being a non-profit might also give us a little financial cushion. We can keep the lights on and pay the staff.”\n\nCountryman agreed.\n\n“Maintaining staff here was huge,” he said. “Nobody wants to lose their job, and our staff is well known by the community.”\n\nMore:Judge orders stay in Short's legal battle, allowing downtown Iowa City location to remain open\n\nHoping for ‘cream of crop’\n\nBoth editors said little may change at first other than learning new systems to upload news, photos, and other content. Eventually, both anticipate working with an influx of UI journalism students anxious to get off-campus newspaper experience.\n\n“It will be good hands-on stuff and give them a taste of covering news in a small community,” Countryman said.\n\nUmscheid hopes to eventually tap student reporters for the stories he considers vital to small communities – such as covering governmental topics like the school board and city council.\n\n“They won’t send us the greenest of the green,” Umscheid said. “We’re hoping they send the cream of the crop.”\n\nUmscheid's main goal is objectivity in covering the news, and he is pleased to retain editorial control through the purchase.\n\n“We are not UI employees and we’re not going to print a Tigerhawk on the masthead,” he told me. “We’re still the editors and will make our own editorial decisions.”\n\nMore:Catch Early Girl, Halfloves, and Spirit Awake at this week's Englert Local Showcase\n\nSmall town dedication\n\nCountryman and Umscheid seem to enjoy the many challenges of small-town newspapering, covering everything from bake sales to ball games and dealing with trying times and tragedies. They acknowledge the work involves long hours for mediocre pay, plus plenty of life interruptions to get the news in print.\n\nSmall examples: During a tornado outbreak last spring, Umscheid watched the roof peel from a Solon hardware store on a live TV station camera feed and raced from his Cedar Rapids home to cover it. Countryman remembers dismissing his staff to enjoy a holiday weekend, then scrambling to cover a house fire for a last-minute frontpage photo.\n\nDedication to small towns comes with the territory.\n\n“My job is basically to tell Solon’s evolving story,” Umscheid said. “I’m dedicated to this community, but I could not do half of what I do if not for the teachers, parents, fire department − everybody who helps out.”\n\n“I see myself as one of the faces of the community,” said Countryman. “When you live here, you are invested. When you go to the city council meeting, you are reporting, but you are a taxpayer, too.”\n\nUmscheid says he “is 100 percent self-taught in reporting and photography.” A Cedar Rapids native, he has a degree in graphic design from Mount Mercy College and held various jobs, including a paramedic and community college instructor, before joining the Solon Economist staff in 2008.\n\n“They took a chance on me,” he said. “Now, all these years later, I’m the last man standing.”\n\nHe has been in Solon for two years alongside an advertising manager with no physical office. Umscheid mostly works from his home in Cedar Rapids. Like Countryman, he’s racked up numerous awards with the INA, many for his photography.\n\nOriginally from Tipton, Countryman is in his eighth year at Mount Vernon, the last three as The Sun’s editor. He has a communications degree from Wartburg College and spent 10 years at the paper in Algona before moving to Mount Vernon.\n\nBoth papers offer online and print editions, and the editors do not see total digital dominance on the horizon.\n\nThese papers are in the two smallest circulation categories of the INA, but unlike other rural Iowa towns, they are serving growing communities. Both say their newspaper coverage areas include 8,000 to 10,000 people each when counting nearby residential developments.\n\nBoth editors believe small-town weeklies are vital to their communities. The local stories come in multitudes, and must be told and recorded.\n\n“If you struggle to find news here,” Countryman said, “then you aren’t doing your job.”\n\nThat’s good news for UI journalism students, who will no doubt soon be prowling the streets of Solon, Mount Vernon, and Lisbon on the hunt for newsworthy options.\n\nWill the Daily Iowan’s move encourage more students choosing small-town weekly newspaper careers over the pace and glamor of big city life?\n\nUmscheid is skeptical, Countryman is more hopeful.\n\n“But both types of journalism are important in this day and age,” Countryman concludes.\n\nThose words ring true.\n\nPress-Citizen columnist Richard Hakes has a deep affection for community journalism, having enjoyed editorial positions in small town weekly newspapers in both Forest City, Iowa, and Tracy, Minnesota, in the very distant past.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2016/09/23/insider-why-cant-colts-stay-healthy/90899262/", "title": "Insider: Why can't the Colts stay healthy?", "text": "Stephen Holder\n\nstephen.holder@indystar.com\n\nINDIANAPOLIS – There are times when reality can be so inconceivable that it begins to seem that the universe is conspiring against you.\n\nAs the Indianapolis Colts bemoan their startlingly long injury list, they could be forgiven for wondering whether fate is not their friend.\n\nRecently, it’s been one frustrating, implausible injury after another. A sampling:\n\n>> Safety Clayton Geathers, simply working out to prepare for training camp, suffers a broken foot.\n\n>> Defensive end Kendall Langford, who has never missed a game in his nine seasons, develops a knee problem in training camp; surgery kept him out a month.\n\nAll things Colts: Latest Indianapolis Colts news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n>> Cornerback Darius Butler, in his first game back from a weekslong ankle injury, grabs an interception in Denver a week ago, makes a beeline toward the end zone, then crashes to the turf in pain after suffering a hamstring strain.\n\nLast week, 16 Colts made an appearance on the injury report – nearly one-third of the players on the active roster.\n\nDoyel on the Colts' CBs: Teammates don't know their names\n\nThat’s more than enough to beg a perplexing question: What are the Colts doing about this?\n\nIf you only knew.\n\nThe Colts have gone to great lengths to prevent exactly the kind of injury toll they're experiencing. They’ve been one of the NFL’s most-injured teams in recent seasons, and they’ve spent an untold amount of money and undertaken many long hours of effort to try to reverse the trend.\n\nThe team has attempted everything from expanding and restructuring its strength and conditioning staff to hiring a full-time dietitian and eliminating unhealthy food from its facility. The Colts have even created “sleep areas” and started a sleep assistance program for players to promote wellness. These are just a few examples of the team’s many efforts in this area.\n\nYet the injuries keep coming.\n\n“You go back and look at all of them,” coach Chuck Pagano said, frustration evident in his voice, “(but) when you go over the middle and you get whacked on the shoulder by a really good defensive back and something happens, that’s football. I don’t care what you are eating. We can go back to pizza, wings and cheeseburgers. When you get jacked up, that’s what happens. You go look at it and overanalyze it.”\n\nColts sticking with plan to limit Luck\n\nAs it turns out, explaining this is rather simple.\n\n“It’s human nature to see a spike in injuries and worry if it’s a trend,” said Dr. Andrew Cosgarea, director of sports medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. “And the consequences in the NFL are huge. Everything from nutrition to strength and conditioning should be analyzed. But sometimes there’s just no smoking gun. If you look at it over time, there’s almost always an evening out.\n\n“It really is just bad luck.”\n\nIn the case of the Colts, really bad luck.\n\nSince 2012, the Colts have suffered an unusually high number of key injuries. According to analysis by mangameslost.com, the Colts have consistently ranked among the hardest-hit teams in football in the site’s Injury Impact to Team Weighted Career Approximate Value. (The website factors players' previous production into its rankings so an injury to a backup lineman counts less than one to the quarterback.) The Colts were the 15th-most injured team in 2015, but were in the bottom 10 from 2012-14. Only the Patriots have suffered worse from injuries between 2012-16.\n\nCertain findings might suggest problems with a team’s habits.\n\nFor example, according to Cosgarea, a recurrence of one particular type of injury could be telling. Or, maybe players are suffering a disproportionate number of injuries in the weight room, which would point to possible overtraining. A rash of turf-related injuries would turn attention to a team’s playing surface.\n\nBut none of those factors appears to be present in the Colts’ situation, leaving them devoid of answers. In fact, the freakish nature of some of the injuries defies explanation.\n\nInsider: Relax. The Colts are fine.\n\nGeathers, for example, was doing a routine workout while preparing for camp.\n\n“I was literally just working out,” he said. “It’s just one of those things.”\n\nHis injury put him on the shelf for about six weeks, causing him to miss all of training camp, the preseason and the regular-season opener.\n\nThe secondary has been particularly hard hit, with Geathers, Butler, Pro Bowl cornerback Vontae Davis, rookie safety T.J. Green and cornerback Patrick Robinson all missing games with injuries — and it’s only Week 3. In the season opener Sept. 11, just one of the team's top five defensive backs — safety Mike Adams — finished the game.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like this, not at one position group,” Davis said.\n\nIronically, the defensive backfield includes some of the players on the team most renowned for their offseason preparation, including Davis. But when he leaped into the air to make a play in practice last month, that didn’t stop his ankle from giving way and rolling inward, causing a severe sprain.\n\n“For the guys that are dealing with these injuries,” linebacker D’Qwell Jackson said, “it’s not that they aren’t taking care of their bodies.”\n\nStill, the Colts have struggled to cope with the losses. Defensive coordinator Ted Monachino has been adapting for weeks now, still unable to field his defense as an intact unit. For the past several weeks, Monachino has been playing backups and newly signed players in key spots, something that has caused him to condense the breadth of his play calling. Some of his primary players are nearing their returns, and the effects are already obvious.\n\n“Now it opens up some other areas of the playbook, which has been helpful,” Monachino said. “It allowed us to game plan a little differently this week… This is a game about Jimmys and Joes and not X’s and O’s.”\n\nThe offense hasn’t escaped this unforgiving injury bug, either. Receiver Donte Moncrief is expected to miss four to six weeks with a shoulder injury, Pagano said. And none other than franchise quarterback Andrew Luck missed practice Wednesday with a sore shoulder, the first time he’s missed a practice since his season-ending kidney injury last November.\n\n“It’s weird,” Geathers said. “Maybe somebody has it out for us.”\n\nThen again, it should be noted that the Colts aren’t alone here. Take, for instance, their opponents on Sunday, the San Diego Chargers. They have a staggering 14 players on injured reserve, including No. 1 wide receiver Keenan Allen and running back Danny Woodhead.\n\n“To say it’s not tough would be not being honest with you,” quarterback Phillip Rivers said.\n\nAnd try walking a mile in the shoes of the Minnesota Vikings, who lost quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to a horrible knee injury and could lose All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson for the season after a torn meniscus.\n\nRest assured, those teams, like the Colts, took great pains to prevent the very injuries that are now significantly undermining their team’s chances. How could they not? The stakes are simply too high.\n\n“The amount you invest in a high-profile player is incredible,” said Cosgarea, who formerly was on the Baltimore Orioles’ medical staff. “All it takes is one high-profile injury to a key player and the season could be over.”\n\nAlong those lines, Pagano managed to find a silver lining in all of this. Maybe, just maybe, the efforts undertaken by the team are actually having an effect.\n\n“We haven’t had five or six season-ending ACLs or Achilles (tendon injuries),” he said, with a hint of optimism.\n\nBut that optimism is blunted by football’s harsh reality.\n\n“When a guy goes up in practice and comes down wrong and gets an ankle (injury)… I don’t know what diet, salad, greens and shakes are going to do for that,” Pagano said. “We are doing the right thing. Don’t get me wrong. (But) football is football, it’s a physical damn game and I think we all know that.”\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Stephen Holder on Twitter: @HolderStephen.\n\nDownload the Indystar Colts App", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/01/austin-job-recruitment-campaign-hiring-vacancies-city-departments/69856494007/", "title": "Austin campaign to fill 2,500 open city jobs. Here's what we know.", "text": "Austin city leaders say they are kicking off a job recruitment campaign aimed at trying to fill more than 2,500 vacancies in a number of departments across the city.\n\nThe hiring campaign, starting Feb. 1, is the largest the city has undertaken and will target residents through print, digital, social media, radio, billboards and bus advertisements. The city expects to spend about $33,000 a month, with that spending already accounted for in the fiscal 2023 budget, City Manager Spencer Cronk said.\n\n“While we’ve made progress in filling positions in recent months, we know there’s more work to do,” Cronk said. “With departments intensifying their efforts to fill vacancies and our new citywide hiring campaign ready to launch, we’ll continue to do everything we can to recruit and retain talented people to deliver the services our community expects.”\n\nHere's what we know about the city's recruitment campaign:\n\nMore:Will new council plan make child care more accessible, affordable in Austin?\n\nWhere does the city have openings?\n\nThere are vacancies across numerous city departments, including its public safety operations, Austin Energy and Austin Water, as well as staffing shortages for lifeguards and library staff.\n\nThe city is operating with a 16.3% job vacancy rate. The vacancy rate for public safety employees is 13.2%, according to city officials.\n\nThe city of Austin employs about 16,000 people, Cronk said.\n\nCronk said this is a trend that is being felt nationally, and it has been hard to address in a single way. But the city is working to get that rate down to about 10%, which is the norm that was seen before the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\n“Every department has their own recruiting strategies,” he said. “But this is a cohesive way to expand our universe of ways to explore jobs in the city.”\n\nMore:Travis County OKs $35 million contract to build housing units for homeless population\n\nHow does the city plan to proceed?\n\nCronk said the city has prioritized recruitment and retention efforts, including increases in pay. In August, the City Council greenlighted an across-the-board 4% increase for city staff – the largest increase in more than two decades – along with a 33% increase in the minimum wage for city employees, raising that to $20 for most workers.\n\nCronk said that increase has already led to a higher volume of applications and more hires.\n\n“The city offers competitive market salaries and provides great health, retirement and other benefits,” Cronk said. “We are also bound by the need to maintain tax- and ratepayer affordability, so we're conscious of the need to find the right balance. We're confident that our new campaign will increase awareness of the many job opportunities available.”\n\nThe hiring campaign also includes:\n\nPrioritizing critical vacancies.\n\nUsing outreach and targeted recruitment to reach underrepresented communities.\n\nExpanding reach via job fairs; professional and trade organizations; conferences; graduate programs; college campuses; citywide affinity groups; and social media.\n\nCreating recruitment videos and flyers with QR codes for quick access to job postings.\n\nSimplifying application processes, including eliminating requests for cover letters and making them more mobile-friendly.\n\nMaking preferred qualifications more flexible.\n\nMaking sure candidates are aware of benefits and vacation time as part of offers.\n\nImplementing flexible schedules and telework opportunities to support work-life balance.\n\nHaving audits and regular surveys of employees to analyze and improve hiring processes and retain employees.\n\nCreating paid internships and apprenticeship positions, with supervision opportunities for existing staff to help with career advancement.\n\nHiring and retention bonuses for employees in positions experiencing high rates of turnover.\n\nOffering incentives for employees who refer new hires.\n\nIncreasing budgets to support professional certifications, training and associations.\n\nHiring additional human resources advisers to assist hiring managers.\n\nMore:Austin unemployment rate dips to 2.7%, but there's 'no slowdown in the need for people'\n\nHow will the city measure success for the campaign?\n\nCronk told the American-Statesman that city staffers will evaluate in six months where vacancies are, and what worked and what didn’t.\n\n“We plan to learn from it and find other ways to get the information out there,” Cronk said.\n\nBut the city expects vacancy rates to remain a challenge for the rest of the year, so Cronk said the city plans to continue its efforts as long as needed.\n\nTo look at current city openings and apply, you can visit www.austincityjobs.org.

Jane Krakowski and I at the very same time said, ‘Live theater!’ I just miss it so much.”\n\nReichert, a longtime subscriber of the Broadway in Columbus series, speaks for many area residents who have been shell-shocked by the suspension of so many in-person arts events during the pandemic. In addition to live theater, countless other major concerts and performances have been postponed, moved online or flat-out canceled.\n\nAs with most facets of life in 2020, this was the year that wasn't when it came to the arts.\n\nConsider the pop music scene: Elton John and Justin Bieber were among the major acts who planned stops in Columbus this year, but neither concert took place. (Bieber is slated to return to Value City Arena in June, while John won’t set foot here until the following year.)\n\nThe Zac Brown Band and Rascal Flatts were to perform at Nationwide Arena before canceling. Other casualties of the coronavirus included the 2020 iteration of Buckeye Country Superfest, with Kenny Chesney headlining.\n\nThis is not to say that every performance was canceled in 2020. Some smaller-scale shows went on in clubs, theaters with limited capacity and even drive-ins.\n\nAnd although some annual events — such as the Nelsonville Music Festival — pivoted to a virtual format, nothing could replace the personal interaction that makes such events so special.\n\nJust ask Teri Snyder, a 54-year-old Gahanna resident who was looking forward to attending the Sonic Temple Art & Music Festival in May at Mapfre Stadium before the hard rock concert bonanza was canceled.\n\n“Especially for these big three-day, four-day festivals, it’s the whole going there each day, seeing the same people, making friends,\" she said. \"It’s that interaction with the crowd.”\n\nScrapped, too, were the long-scheduled season plans of numerous local performing arts organizations. It seemed as if almost no one was spared.\n\n“It’s kind of like the lost season — or the lost seasons, because it’s half of last and most of this (season),” said Janet Chen, CEO of the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra, which canceled the remaining concerts in its 2019-20 season early in the pandemic and never announced what would have been its usual 2020-21 season in the Southern Theatre.\n\nThe group has put on small concerts in nontraditional or outdoor venues, but nothing like what might have been. Among the most prominent cancellations for ProMusica: a visit from noted Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov, which had been scheduled for June.\n\n“It was such a coup for the organization to have him come,” Chen said. “The pandemic hit not long after that show went on sale. ... That was a hard one to swallow.”\n\nCOVID-19 upended shows in progress, too, including Broadway in Columbus’ presentation of “My Fair Lady.” The show, set to run March 11-15, was canceled after a single performance when Gov. Mike DeWine’s initial ban on gatherings went into effect. (Severe capacity restrictions in indoor theaters remain.)\n\nThe remaining shows in Broadway in Columbus’ 2019-20 season — “Miss Saigon” and “Wicked” — never made it to town, while the previously announced 2020-21 season, including “Come from Away” and the Tony award-winning “Hadestown,” now consists of a smorgasbord of postponements.\n\n“Along with a lot of Columbus, (we were) really looking forward to bringing ‘Come from Away’ here, because of the strong Columbus connection to the show,” said Lisa Minken, the Broadway in Columbus marketing manager at the Columbus Association for the Performing Arts. (The show tells of airline passengers who were temporarily stranded in Newfoundland on Sept. 11, 2001; a pregnant bonobo — a small ape — was among those rescued and eventually ended up at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.)\n\nCAPA president and CEO Chad Whittington said he feels the pain of longtime subscribers who have come to value how quickly Broadway shows have traditionally made it to Columbus: “They miss Broadway, just like we do here at CAPA.”\n\nThe pandemic did not spare offerings that had been annual favorites for years or even decades. Since 1969, “The Nutcracker” had been presented each year in the Ohio Theatre by BalletMet or predecessor organizations.\n\n“No matter how hard the year is, you have the holidays and your loved ones and ‘The Nutcracker’ to gather everyone together,” said BalletMet Artistic Director Edwaard Liang, who realized in the summer that this year’s production likely wouldn't be possible.\n\nThat early determination didn’t make the cancellation of “The Nutcracker” any less devastating — financially or emotionally.\n\n“It’s what keeps every ballet company’s lights on, and it pays for the rest of the year’s productions,” said Liang, adding that the financial toll is eclipsed by the emotional impact.\n\n“We serve over 30,000 individuals in our community with this production — that’s 30,000 people that experience ‘The Nutcracker,’” Liang said.\n\nThat includes himself.\n\n“This will be absolutely the first year I have not watched a whole production,” he said.\n\nBefore it was canceled early in the pandemic, this year’s Columbus Arts Festival was scheduled for June 12-14 on the Scioto Mile. The 59-year-old annual event, shining a spotlight on visual and performing artists, shifted to a virtual version, but that was no substitute for the half-million in-person visitors who normally would have attended.\n\n“That was the most heartbreaking part about it — knowing that people in our community would lose this opportunity to connect with the arts,” said Jami Goldstein, vice president of marketing, communications and events at the Greater Columbus Arts Council, which produces the event. “Lots of tears were shed the day that we made that decision (to cancel).”\n\nFor many central Ohioans, missing out on favorite arts events has had a personal component.\n\nFairfield County residents Lynn and Ricardo Barboza have served as a Lancaster Festival “host family” for a number of years — putting up out-of-town musicians in their home during the festival, which has presented music and other arts events each summer since 1985.\n\n“It wasn’t just being with them and finding out about them, but it was also having them play in the house for practice sessions,” Lynn Barboza said. “You get to know them; they’re like family after a while — it doesn’t take long, actually.”\n\nThis year, with the Lancaster Festival called off, Barboza had to come to terms with a summer without live music.\n\n“It felt like something was missing, for sure — not just music and all the fun, but just the camaraderie,” she said.\n\nUpper Arlington couple Marty and Gerald Worth have beaten a path to the Ohio Theatre for close to two decades, regularly taking in various classical music, dance and theater offerings.\n\n“Our lives have become so diminished because of this,” said Marty Worth, 80. “I went to the Broadway series with my sister. I went to the ballet with my sister-in-law.”\n\nThe Worths said they especially miss attending concerts of the Columbus Symphony, which has aggressively presented small-scale, outreach and virtual concerts, but whose core concerts, like those of nearly every other arts organization, were canceled. That included the popular summertime Picnic With the Pops in the John F. Wolfe Columbus Commons and the previously announced fall season, which was set to kick off in October with “Carmina Burana” in the Ohio Theatre.\n\n“We go to, for sure, four concerts a year, usually if there’s Beethoven or if there’s a specific artist that we like,” Worth said.\n\nEven the visual arts world — whose galleries and museums have been able to offer virtual exhibits while reopening to varying degrees — has not been exempt from delays and outright cancellations.\n\nThe Columbus Museum of Art has twice closed its doors just after or shortly before major exhibition openings. “Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989” opened just over a week before the museum shut down from March through June, and “Raggin’ On: The Art of Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson’s House and Journals” was a day away from opening last month before the museum closed again. (The museum has since reopened.)\n\nThe seesaw effect is not lost on Executive Director Nannette V. Maciejunes.\n\n“People have been calling it ping-ponging,” Maciejunes said. “I’m OK with ping-ponging. ... I would rather ping-pong than just do another really protracted closure for us.”\n\nThe museum also partnered with Opera Columbus — which has not presented a live performance since February — on “The Poppea Project,” an ambitious combination of music and visual arts that was slated for April at the museum’s Pizzuti Collection.\n\n“We had finished the installation. It was an installation no one ever saw,” Maciejunes said.\n\nAlthough the opera hopes to revive the collaboration in 2022, there’s a chance that it — like so much else planned to take place this year — will never be seen.\n\nMany local organizations, including CATCO, the Columbus Symphony, and the Jazz Arts Group have moved to virtual events, but Broadway in Columbus fan Reichert said that normal, in-person performances are irreplaceable.\n\n“It’s the whole evening — getting dressed up, going out to dinner beforehand, going in, just feeling the anticipation and hearing the conversations of the people around you, and then the lights dimming,” Reichert said. “There’s nothing like it.”\n\nThat’s a sentiment shared even among those in the local film scene, which, by definition, doesn’t have the same live component as theater.\n\nThe Wexner Center for the Arts’ film/video department — closed for public screenings since March — has presented several virtual cinema programs that, officials say, have reached thousands of viewers. But many in-person screenings, including a 12-film retrospective of Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini, were canceled, and even those programs that are presented online were missing a key component: live audience reactions.\n\n“There is a little bit of an emptiness to work on some of these programs, and in some cases work really hard to get these programs ready to present online, and you don’t have the normal engagement and feedback with an audience,” said Wexner Center film/video director David Filipi.\n\nIt's difficult to predict when live arts events will return, or how much of 2021 will resemble the lost year of 2020, but local leaders are certain that, whenever normalcy returns, audiences will again stand in line for their favorite singer or show.\n\n“Seeing those live people on stage, feeling the emotion that’s coming from them, sharing the sadness and the laughs with the audience around you — it’s just something you don’t recreate when you’re sitting on your couch at home,” Whittington said. “People really miss that; they crave it.”\n\nThat goes for Marty Worth and her husband, too.\n\n“We had a really active social life,” Worth said. “As soon as I feel it’s safe to go, I’ll be down there first in line.”\n\ntonguetteauthor2@aol.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/08/10/it-ends-with-us-cast-drama-explained/74740951007/", "title": "'It Ends with Us' drama: Brandon Sklenar defends Blake Lively", "text": "\"It Ends with Us,\" the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's bestseller, is in theaters now.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nFrom oddly paired press junkets and awkward red-carpet appearances to interview snubs from the cast, here's why the movie's promotional tour has the internet up in arms.\n\nWhat is the 'It Ends with Us' controversy?\n\nIt all started Aug. 6 at the New York City premiere of \"It Ends with Us,\" when fans noticed there wasn't a single shot of the entire cast together.\n\nLively was photographed with husband Ryan Reynolds (who has joined in on the press junket run for this movie as well), fellow A-lister friend Hugh Jackman, and co-stars Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar.\n\nBut what stood out the most was that Baldoni only appeared on the red carpet solo and side-by-side with his wife, Emily Baldoni, and other friends and family — but never with Lively or other co-stars.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Baldoni also allegedly didn't introduce the film ahead of the screening with Lively and Hoover, despite being the director and star of the film.\n\nBaldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, acquired the rights to the book in 2019, and Lively's casting in \"It Ends with Us\" was announced in January 2023.\n\nBlake Lively, Colleen Hoover allegedly unfollow Justin Baldoni on Instagram\n\nFollowing the premiere, internet sleuths began scrutinizing the cast's social media activity and claimed that Hoover and Lively unfollowed Baldoni on Instagram.\n\nNone of the main cast members of \"It Ends with Us\" follow Baldoni on the social media platform, as of publication. Lively follows Sklenar, Hoover and Slate.\n\n'It Ends with Us':Five major changes between the book and movie\n\nJustin Baldoni promoted 'It Ends with Us' separately from cast\n\nLively has promoted the film in joint interviews with co-stars Sklenar, Slate and Isabela Ferrer.\n\nEven Lively's husband Reynolds got in on the promo action, conducting a playful interview with Sklenar, in which he pretended to crash the actor's press junket.\n\nHowever, fans began to notice Baldoni was doing press for the film primarily in solo interviews, including appearances on the \"Today\" show, \"CBS Mornings\" and \"Access Hollywood.\"\n\nWhen asked about Lively on \"Access Hollywood,\" Baldoni gushed about the \"brilliance of Blake Lively\" and how she informed his performance as Ryle. \"She's such a wonderful listener,\" Baldoni said. \"So, having her as a scene partner made me better.\"\n\nJenny Slate avoids interview question about Justin Baldoni\n\nFans doubled down on the cast drama rumors when Slate — who plays Lively's on-screen best friend Allysa — avoided directly answering a question about Baldoni's directing chops.\n\n\"Talk to me, what was that like — having (Justin Baldoni) be director but also scene partner?\" an interviewer for Deadline asked Slate at the New York premiere.\n\nTo which Slate answered, \"I mean, what an intense job? To have to do so many things.\" She added that she \"was looking around just being like, 'I'm good with just acting, I love it.' \"\n\nAnd at no point did she mention Baldoni.\n\nWho plays Lily, Ryle and Atlasin 'It Ends with Us' movie?

It was a really pleasant environment to work in.\"\n\nJustin Baldoni suggests Blake Lively should direct 'It Ends with Us' sequel\n\nAt the movie's New York City premiere Aug. 6, Baldoni told Entertainment Tonight that he felt there were \"better people\" suited to direct the sequel to \"It Ends with Us.\"\n\nIn October 2022, Hoover picked up where \"It Ends with Us\" left off and published \"It Starts With Us,\" centering on the relationship with Lily and Atlas. It has not been confirmed whether a sequel is in the works.\n\n\"I think Blake Lively's ready to direct, that's what I think,\" Baldoni told ET. \"This isn't my night — this is a night for all the women who we made this movie for. This is a night for Blake, this is a night for Colleen. I'm just so grateful that we're here, five years in the making.\"\n\nJustin Baldoni on working with 'complex personalities' on set\n\nIn an interview published on Today.com, Baldoni said, \"Every movie is a miracle. And then, of course, you're navigating complex personalities and trying to get everybody on the same page with the same vision.\"\n\nThe actor said at times he felt as though people on set wondered \"if I know what I'm doing or if I have a point of view because I'm so willing to have my vision changed.\"\n\nIn an interview with Elle UK published Aug. 9, Baldoni addressed \"friction\" on the set of \"It Ends with Us\": \"As a filmmaker, you’re always navigating personalities.\"\n\n\"There are all these things that happen every day on set, there's always friction that happens when you make a movie like this. Then at the end of the day, it's that friction, I believe, that creates the beautiful art,\" he told Elle.\n\nBlake Lively says Ryan Reynolds rewrote 'It Ends with Us' rooftop scene\n\nWhile Baldoni served as director and producer of \"It Ends with Us,\" it's Reynolds who Lively has praised for his creative contributions.\n\n\"The iconic rooftop scene, my husband actually wrote it,\" Lively revealed to E! News. \"Nobody knows that but you now.\"\n\n\"We help each other,\" she added. \"He works on everything I do. I work on everything he does. So his wins, his celebrations are mine and mine are his. I mean, he's all over this film.\"\n\nThe film's screenwriter, Christy Hall, told People magazine she wasn't aware Reynolds had any part in writing that scene.\n\nBlake Lively posts the National Domestic Violence Hotline\n\nWhile the film adaptation of \"It Ends with Us\" doesn't shy away from tackling the book's unflinching portrayal of domestic violence, many fans have taken issue with the lighthearted tone of the film's marketing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 13, Lively addressed the film's domestic violence on her Instagram stories in a pair of posts. \"It Ends With Us is a story of the female experience,\" she wrote. \"All the highest highs, and lowest lows.

Gregory and Hyacinth are far too young, which leaves Benedict and Eloise. So, who is it going to be?\n\nHere's what we know about Season 4 of \"Bridgerton\" so far, including cast and release date.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Bridgerton' twist:Does it signal queer romance to come?\n\nWill there be 'Bridgerton' Season 4?\n\nYes. In April 2021, a few months after the Season 1, Netflix announced that \"Bridgerton\" would be renewed for Season 3 and 4.\n\n\"Esteemed members of the Ton. It seems we have a rather special announcement,\" Netflix had said in their announcement. \"'Bridgerton' shall return for seasons three and four. This author shall have to purchase more ink...\"\n\n'Bridgerton' Season 4 release date\n\nNetflix hasn't exactly been consistent as far as \"Bridgerton\" release dates are concerned.\n\nThe first season released in December 2020 and the second season landed a little more than a year after in March 2022. However, Season 3 took its sweet time, coming just over two years later and in separate parts. Part 1 of Season 3 dropped May 16, while Part 2 released on June 13. In between Seasons 2 and 3, Netflix released \"Queen Charlotte,\" a spinoff from the \"Bridgerton\" series with none of the main Bridgerton siblings.\n\nNetflix has not yet announced the details for Season 4, but showrunner Jess Brownell, speaking to The Hollywood Reporter at the U.K. premiere for Part 2 Wednesday night, said fans can expect a wait of up to two years.\n\n\"We are working to try and put the seasons out more quickly, but they do take eight months to film and then they have to be edited and then they have to be dubbed into every language,\" Brownell told THR. \"And the writing takes a very long time as well, so we're kind of on a two-year pace, we're trying to speed up, but somewhere in that range.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the Los Angeles Times, Brownell revealed that the next season will begin filming in the fall and that the next season may have a warmer vibe to it compared to the pastels and spring-like feel of the last three seasons.\n\n'Bridgerton' Season 4 lead couple\n\nNetflix and the cast and creators of \"Bridgerton\" have been rather tight-lipped over which Bridgerton sibling will be leading Season 4. Will it be the free-willed Eloise (Claudia Jessie) or the second-born son Benedict (Luke Thompson) or even Francesca, whose story is not yet complete? The producers haven't followed Quinn's chronology, switching things up to surprise audiences.\n\nWhen the first part of Season 3 released in May, Jessie, in an interview with USA TODAY, said: \"I don't know anything. But I'm going to be so brokenhearted when I have to stop playing Eloise. I just want to be here as long as I can.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party!Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nAt the end of Season 3, Eloise departs for Scotland to live with her younger sister Francesca at her husband, the Earl of Kilmartin's estate there, in order to see more of the world before she can \"attempt\" to change it. However, she tells big brother Benedict that she will return before their mother's masquerade ball, where Benedict is expected to meet his love interest Sophie Beckett, if the books are anything to go by.\n\nThompson, meanwhile, in a recent interview with USA TODAY tried to evade the question, coyly saying: \"Oh, my God, no. I don't even know if it is next season.\"\n\n\"I couldn't possibly comment. I know nothing,\" he said, adding that he's excited to eventually \"deep dive\" into Benedict's character.\n\nBenedict, at the end of Season 3, ended things with Lady Tilly Arnold, telling her that he was enjoying his freedom and wanted to explore more of the world. Tilly was hoping for a more substantial relationship with the Bridgerton brother, telling him that even \"merriment can grow tiresome.\" That conversation seemed to have resonated with Benedict and in his parting shot, he appears to be at a crossroads over his future.\n\n“I’m really excited about what we’re writing,\" Brownell told THR. \"We’re towards the end with the writers room season, with the scripts. And I feel like it’s some of my best work and my writers room’s best work. We’ve just really gelled our collaboration, and we’re firing on all cylinders so I can’t wait for fans to see what we have.”\n\nInterview:Luke Thompson talks 'Bridgerton's' next season, all things Benedict\n\nWho will play Sophie Beckett?\n\nNetflix has not yet announced if Benedict will be leading Season 4 and have also not revealed who will be playing his love interest from the books, Sophie Beckett, the illegitimate daughter of Richard Gunningworth, the Earl of Penwood, and a maid.\n\nBrownell told TVLine that “for any character’s season, we try to save all the big building blocks of their season for their season.\"\n\n\"When we start out any season, we want our protagonists to be at the very beginning of their journey in many ways and to still have a lot of room for growth so that we can really dig in,\" Brownell said.\n\n'Bridgerton' cast\n\nWhile Netflix has not yet announced cast details for Season 4 of \"Bridgerton,\" it is likely that much of the recurring cast would be returning for the new season, though some of them may have limited screentime, based on previous trends. Viewers can also expect to see new characters such as Micheala Stirling, who made a brief appearance at the end of Season 3.\n\nMeanwhile, here's a list of actors and their characters in Season 3 of \"Bridgerton\":\n\nLuke Newton as Colin Bridgerton\n\nNicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington\n\nClaudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton\n\nLuke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton\n\nJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton\n\nSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma\n\nRuth Gemmell as Violet Bridgerton\n\nHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton\n\nVictor Alli as Lord John Stirling (the Earl of Kilmartin)\n\nMasali Baduza as Michaela Stirling, Lord John's cousin\n\nFlorence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton\n\nWill Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton\n\nGolda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte\n\nAdjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\nJulie Andrews as Lady Whistledown\n\nLorraine Ashbourne as Mrs. Varley\n\nHarriet Cains as Philipa Featherington\n\nBessie Carter as Prudence Featherington\n\nJessica Madsen as Cressida Cowper\n\nMartins Imhangbe as Will Mondrich\n\nPolly Walker as Portia Featherington\n\nDaniel Francis as Marcus Anderson\n\nSam Phillips as Lord Debling\n\nWho is Michaela Stirling?\n\nAt the end of Season 3, viewers are introduced to a new character Michaela Stirling, who is the cousin of Earl of Kilmartin, Lord John. Michaela, who will be accompanying Eloise, John and Francesca to Scotland, leaves Francesca slightly flustered as she introduces herself.\n\nBrownell, in an interview with Glamour, confirmed that Michaela will be playing Francesca's love interest, and that they have planned a queer romance for the character.\n\nThe showrunner, in her interview, said when she first read Francesca's book \"When He Was Wicked,\" she \"really related to it as a queer woman,\" explaining how the book \"talks a lot about how different she feels.\"\n\n\"I think Julia Quinn's intention in the book is just that Fran feels different because she's introverted. But for many of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different is a part of our stories,\" Brownell said in the interview, adding that she felt like \"there was fertile ground thematically in her book to nod toward telling a queer story\" with a happy ending.\n\n\"It was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple,\" Brownell said.\n\nIn the books, John and Francesca have a blissful marriage, until John dies from a brain aneurysm. His best friend, Micheal, who is secretly in love with his wife, becomes the Earl and takes over the estate. However, devastated from his friend's death, Michael flees to India to grieve. However, when he returns years later, Francesca is seeking a second husband to start a family and the two end up falling in love and getting married.\n\nHow many seasons will 'Bridgerton' have?\n\n\"Bridgerton\" is slated for eight seasons, given that there are eight books in Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series.\n\nBrownell told TVLine that the producers are \"aiming for eight seasons,\" and \"want every sibling to have their own season.\"\n\nExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes also previously said they plan to adapt all eight Bridgerton books into eight seasons for Netflix.\n\nSo, stay tuned, gentle reader.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

An employee said traffic was about what he’d expect.\n\nCity Social employee Jeloni Woulard also said business was normal for a Monday.

King Dr. had four patrons inside, and down the street at Who’s On Third, the Old German Beer Hall and Brat House each had about a dozen people eating and drinking.\n\nAt Milwaukee's famous German restaurant, Mader's, the large outdoor beer garden was empty, and a third of the tables inside occupied.\n\nPere Marquette Park, a fenced-off area which is an extension of the Republican National Convention, had a handful of people sitting on benches as the sun set and the storm began to roll over Milwaukee.\n\n— Jordyn Noennig and Vanessa Swales\n\nFormer president Trump is en route to the Republican National Convention, CNN, ABC are reporting\n\nDonald Trump is expected to make an appearance, but is not expected to speak, according to ABC News.\n\n“A large motorcade recently left the hotel where Trump is staying and appears to be heading in the direction of the venue,” ABC News said.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly gets business as official watch party\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly in the Deer District was getting good business, thanks to its location near Fiserv Forum and the home of the watch party, according to Nick Olgray, manager at Drink Wisconsinbly.\n\n“This is busier than what we were expecting,” he said.\n\nHe suspected that the shooting of Trump Saturday “brought out a lot of people.”\n\nOlgray said that, when the convention took a break in the afternoon, the space was full, with a line out the door.\n\nAround 7:30, there was a lull, with about 30 people in the bar and a Fox News setup for a live broadcast.

Van Orden said Vance's upbringing and commitment to serving voters who live in rural areas or below the poverty line will offer a balance to the Republican ticket, contrasting Trump's billionaire status.\n\n\"If you look at that, that's an expression of the American dream,\" he said. \"People are going to gravitate towards that.\"\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nLocal government leaders decry Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal government leaders from across the U.S. gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to highlight the importance of the level of government closest to the people.\n\n“America’s mayors are driving solutions at the local level,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who was joined by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Rancho Cordova, California, Mayor David Sander and New York City Council member Joseph Borelli.\n\nThe group said whether Trump or President Joe Biden wins a second White House term, local governments will need a strong partnership with the federal government to address challenges in communities.\n\nJohnson pointed to the federal pandemic aid that reached local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act, saying it helped prevent Milwaukee from becoming insolvent and gave Wisconsin’s largest city the time it needed to reach a funding agreement with the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nSander, who is also president of the National League of Cities, called the attempted assassination an “attempt to murder democracy.”\n\n“That violence is a reminder of the responsibilities we all have as leaders to create stronger communities and to act swiftly to disavow hate and violence wherever we find it,” he said. “It was a reminder quite frankly of what our fellow mayors and council members and aldermen have known for way too long: that hate and violence toward elected officials in our country has been rising and it must end.”\n\nLeaders, he said, must “model better ideals for our democracy.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nFire and medical personnel field heat exhaustion calls\n\nA man experiencing what a police officer said was heat exhaustion got help from Milwaukee police and medics around 5:40 p.m. near the corner of State and Water streets as vehicles entered the convention perimeter.\n\nTemperatures in Milwaukee reached the upper 80s Monday.

Carlos Velazquez Sanchez.\n\n— Drake Bentley, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nLiz Truss, former UK prime minister, is attending the RNC\n\nLiz Truss, the former Conservative Party prime minister of the United Kingdom, is at the RNC.Truss posted a photo of herself in front of Fiserv Forum on X, formerly Twitter, Monday afternoon.\n\n“Great to be at @RNC in Milwaukee seeing President Trump get nominated,” she said in the post. “The leadership the West needs.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Truss is expected to speak at the event.\n\nFollowing an assassination attempt on Trump, Truss encouraged her 666,400 X followers to pray for the former president and America. She later took to X again to call Trump “the strength the world needs.”\n\nTruss was a member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in various capacities from 2010 to 2024. Earlier this month, she lost her seat in Parliament in the U.K. general election.\n\nIn 2022, Truss resigned around a month and a half after becoming UK prime minister, making her the shortest-serving UK PM, BBC reported.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Cory Booker meet with high school students\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke with a group of high school students at the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Monday afternoon, listening to stories of why investing in the arts should be more important for the federal government.\n\nThe two also weighed in on Trump’s vice presidential selection in the hours after the announcement.\n\nBaldwin said that Trump’s selection of Vance was an “expected choice in many ways.” She said she’s worked to author legislation with Vance, but said that Democrats now have to keep the focus on their values.\n\n“What we have to keep the focus on is the difference between what Democrats stand for and our ticket,” she said. “And what (Republicans) stand for, Project 2025 is extremely scary. And voters need to know that they have a real choice.”\n\nBooker echoed that sentiment.\n\n“They don’t stand with the values of the majority of American people when it comes to things like health coverage, with reproductive rights,” he said. “So this is going to be a very clear choice.”\n\nThe senators also addressed the growing amount of political violence in America, which culminated in former president being shot Saturday.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nInterview with Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\nChurch flies LGBTQ+ Pride flag as message of love\n\nJust a couple of blocks east of Fiserv Forum at Village Church, Pastor Donna Brown and congregants hung up an LGBTQ+ Pride flag outside the front of the unassuming building.\n\n“We’re called to be inclusive and loving,” Brown said. “Anybody is welcome in, even if they don’t agree with us.”\n\nShe and four members of the church were laying out food and drinks inside the building, preparing for the rescheduled gathering. It’s a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America denomination with a special designation to welcome LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nEarlier, she had placed a sign in large font on the front door reading “No Weapons Allowed.\"\n\n“We don’t feel violence is an answer,” Brown said. “More weapons cause more violence.”\n\nLifelong Milwaukeean and member of the church Bill Koehn, 73, said security and the events of the last 48 hours were the main topics of conversation at the church’s Sunday service.\n\n“The bottom line is we are all about spreading the message of love and we don’t discriminate,” Koehn said.\n\nGesturing to the flag, he said: “If somebody has an issue with this being displayed or the fact that there is a church right here, on whatever level, that’s why we have our doors open so we can sit down and have a dialogue like this and get the opinions from people.”\n\nWhile he lamented Milwaukee's failed DNC in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Koehn said he was “OK” with the convention being in Milwaukee, especially the economic benefits and how it highlights the city of Milwaukee “in a way that doesn’t happen very often.”\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nMan disrupting protesters arrested by Milwaukee police\n\nA 36-year-old man was arrested Monday afternoon after disrupting protesters during the end of a march at Red Arrow Park, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nAuthorities say the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at the park, 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nMilwaukee police said the man was arrested, cited and later released.\n\nThe video of the incident, which was posted on X, has more than 6,000 views:\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nTrump cereal for sale\n\nCrosswords lovers can have a Trump-themed start to their morning with a MAGA-branded cereal available for sale.\n\nIn the “soft” pedestrian zone, Milwaukee residents Crystal King and another person employed by the Trump campaign hung up posters advertising Trump cereal boxes that promises “greatness in every bowl.” They said it tasted like Fruity Pebbles.\n\nBoxes are $30 a pop, or $20 if you’re willing to forgo the cereal inside it.\n\n“Missing those lively family discussions? Trump Cereal is your new table centerpiece,” the website says. “It's not just about the crunch, but the conversations it sparks — from light-hearted banter to deep political chats.”\n\nThe crossword puzzle on the back includes phrases like “fake news,” “crooked Hillary” and we won’t spoil the rest.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nCanary Coffee seeing more customers 'for a Monday'\n\nCanary Coffee, just outside the hard security perimeter at 720 N. King Dr., saw an uptick in business on the first day of the convention.\n\n“A lot more business than normal for a Monday,” said employee Josh Beamsley, adding the customers are not their normal clientele.\n\nIn preparation for the big week Canary Coffee stocked up on extra ingredients including double the amount of milk it normally has.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nResearchers surveying protesters for study on contemporary U.S. politics\n\nStudent volunteers were surveying protesters at Red Arrow Park on Monday afternoon to understand why people choose to protest and the impact protests may have on contemporary politics in the U.S. The survey is funded and led by Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nMichael Heaney of the University of Glasgow and his team have surveyed about 140 people at the RNC in Milwaukee so far. He’s also surveyed protests at previous RNC and DNC conventions in 2008 and 2016. In comparison to previous RNC protests, this year’s is less organized and smaller, Heaney said, possibly due to the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n“It may make the protests smaller because people are nervous about political events. I would project marginally smaller and marginally more intense protests,” he said.\n\nSasmit Rahman, 22, and Emily Chu, 22, traveled to from Minneapolis to march on the RNC. Rahman said they are looking forward to the results of the survey specifically around race and gender of protesters. Chu is interested to learn how people’s emotions may push them to attend protests.\n\n“I think it’s interesting to see whether it’s fear or hope that motivates people more,” Chu said.\n\n— Gina Castro\n\nNorth Carolina delegate loves Trump’s VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina delegate Pauline Bruno gushed about Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\n“We are so pleased,” she said in a seersucker blazer and Trump-printed shoes she bought on Etsy.\n\nBruno loved Vance’s focus on the Rust Belt in his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that she read two years ago.\n\nMilwaukee has been “so welcoming,” she said. She praised the police and said she had “no concerns” about security.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nGuests and delegates appeared to be in high spirits as they wandered downtown Milwaukee after the first afternoon of the convention.\n\nAsif Shahzada, a Wisconsin delegate and La Crosse resident, said the energy was “wonderful” inside Fiserv Forum when Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“I love Trump’s policies,” Shahzada said. “Everybody is energetic. It’s fun to meet other delegates.”\n\nShahzada, who recently immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan, is attending the RNC for the first time this year and said he’s already met people from at least five other states. He owns and operates The Sushi Pirate, a restaurant in downtown La Crosse.\n\nFor other convention-goers, it’s far from their first rodeo: Floyd Brown, a Phoenix resident, said he’s attended every RNC since 1984, save for the mostly virtual convention during the pandemic.\n\n“The party is more unified than I’ve seen in decades,” Brown said after the delegate roll call. “It’s more somber this year, but people are also very upbeat.”\n\nBrown, who is an invited guest at the convention, is also a political commentator and author of “Counterpunch,”a 2023 book advocating for peaceful resistance against leftist movements. He said he feels the Republican party has unified in the face of rising political division, especially given the assassination attempt on Trump just days before the convention.\n\nBrown is attending the RNC with his wife, Mary Beth, who said she was excited by Trump’s announcement of Vance as his running mate this afternoon.\n\n“I think he’s going to do an excellent job,” Mary Beth Brown said of Vance.\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nBobby Flowers, florist at Marius Bell Floral & Design, arrived at the Milwaukee Public Market around 11 a.m., and as of 5:30 p.m. said he's never seen the market so empty on a Monday.\n\n\"It's been dead,\" he said. \"There's usually a lot of tourist traffic here on Mondays, and it's just been so quiet today. It feels so strange.\"\n\nAs of 6 p.m., only eight patrons were seated in the market's upstairs dining area with roughly 20 to 30 patrons shopping or dining on the main floor. Five open tables were available at St. Paul Fish Co.\n\nOutside at the St. Paul Palapa tiki bar, all bar stools were occupied.\n\n— Rachel Bernhard\n\nA photo posted on X shows British comedian and actor Russell Brand, a Trump supporter and conservative internet personality, walking around downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe post says he was seen taking photos with fans and police officers near the Baird Center.\n\nBrand is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts music recital hall, and at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield on Wednesday.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke Monday evening called the Coalition to March on the RNC protest “extremely smooth and safe.”\n\n“I was really pleased with everyone, I think globally,” said Goyke, who observed the march on the first day of the Republican National Convention. “We had protesters and counter protesters. Everyone that was here seemed well organized, there was communication, law enforcement were everywhere they needed to be, communicating with individuals.”\n\nHe said he and his staff would be out in the coming days as well to monitor areas people are expressing their First Amendment rights and how government responds if an incident does occur.\n\nHe also said he got to talk with the Columbus Police Department’s 13-member Police Dialogue Team that was also out at the protest.\n\nIt’ll be interesting, he said, to see whether Milwaukee pursues a similar team at its own police department.\n\n“It’s a special team with training and background to go into protests or potential civil unrest, these kind of emotion-filled environments, and I thought they did a great job today,” he said.\n\nCommunication ahead of time helped ensure everyone was on the same page, Goyke said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nPopular Wisconsin beer sparks political discussion\n\nSpotted Cow, the beer from the New Glarus Brewing Company, prompted the start of a discussion about the beer and its place in Wisconsin culture and politics.\n\nPolitico correspondent Adam Wren reported that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told a passerby that Spotted Cow is pretty good, “but the owner is ultraliberal. Leinenkugel’s is the conservative one.”\n\nHowever, social users have also made their opinions on the beer and the senator’s criticism.\n\nJournalist Robert Evans said that Wisconsin should be proud of Spotted Cow.\n\n“My primary takeaway from the Milwaukee RNC: Spotted Cow is an excellent beer, shocked by how good it is,” Evans said in an X post.\n\nX user Josh Geise (@joshgeise) said, “Was at Kohler this weekend. Had my first Spotted Cow. So glad to hear it’s ‘ultraliberal.’”\n\nAnother X user, Chaddy (@brewcity43) said, “Spotted (C)ow is okay, and (Leinenkugel’s) is average, as well.”\n\n– Angelika Ytuarte\n\n50 Cent will not attend the RNC, rep says\n\nFollowing reports that rap icon 50 Cent was in discussions with Republican officials about appearing at the convention, his representatives told TMZ that he will not be attending.\n\n\"He is not attending (the RNC), as he is slated to be in Shreveport preparing for his ‘Humor and Harmony’ festival,” his rep said\n\nThe business mogul, born Curtis Jackson, made a post on X on Saturday of his iconic 2003 album cover but instead replaced himself with Trump.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse looking for patrons\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse setup a pop up Beer Garden just outside of the hard security zone and not many people have shown up throughout the first day of the convention.\n\n”I think the security measures are more restrictive than we anticipated so it’s really difficult for people to get here,” Brent Brashier, owner of Doc’s Smokehouse, said.\n\nHe added there is an exit right in front of the beer garden but not many are going through that way.“Not really anybody knows it’s an exit because it’s padlocked,” Brashier said.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nModel Amber Rose spotted around Milwaukee\n\nMilwaukeeans have seen popular model and TV star Amber Rose around the city in recent days after she announced last week she would be a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter spotted the model, rapper and television personality eating at the Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar in downtown Milwaukee Sunday afternoon. Fans gathered around the model and took photos with her, including one resident who snapped a selfie with Rose outside the restaurant.\n\nThe popular television personality has been trending on social media following her announcement back in May that she was in support of former President Donald Trump. Rose announced on July 8 on X that she would be a speaker for the RNC.\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Quinn Clark\n\nJason Storms criticizes Republican Party's abortion stance\n\nJason Storms, national director for Operation Save America, appeared outside the Marcus Center around 5 p.m. to criticize the Republican Party for not taking a stronger stance on abortion.\n\n“We’re committed to the protection of preborn children,” said Storms. Storms was scheduled to speak at Haymarket Square at 4 p.m. but relocated because it was deserted.\n\nWhen the Republican Party finalized its platform this week, it did not include language calling for a national ban on abortion.\n\nThe platform stated: “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those rights.”\n\nAccording to its website, Operation Save America argues a “biblical worldview must govern all areas of both our private and public lives.” It is known for displaying graphic images of aborted fetuses as part of its anti-abortion advocacy and has stated that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty. Storms is the son-in-law of anti-abortion extremist Matt Trewhella.\n\nStorms was accompanied by several of his teenage children, who held large banners with anti-abortion imagery and quotes from the Bible.\n\n— Alex Groth and Cleo Krejci\n\nAttendee mixes RNC with her bachelorette party\n\nTemperatures have remained steadily in the high 80s across Milwaukee’s downtown.\n\nAnd as the afternoon has chugged along, Milwaukee’s Deer District has started to fill out with delegates, guests and volunteers spilling out from Fiserv Forum, seeking out cooling refreshments at local establishments like freshly opened New Fashioned, and its veteran neighbors, The DW Pub and The Mecca.\n\nConservative nonprofit Turning Point Action blasted out from speakers, ringing loudly throughout the plaza, discussing the recent pick of J.D. Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\nFor Texan delegate alternate Rachel Sikes, it’s where she’ll celebrate her bachelorette party as the table calls for more cheese curds at The New Fashioned\n\n“It was just happenstance,” she said.\n\nShe’s getting married July 27. So far, they’ve enjoyed drinks on Lake Mendota in Madison, where they're staying.\n\nShe said she was OK with the vice presidential choice.\n\n“It wasn’t my first choice, but I support the president,” she said.\n\n— Vanessa Swales and Jordyn Noennig\n\nSenate candidate Rejani Raveendran campaigns at Red Arrow Park\n\nRejani Raveendran, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, was introducing herself to people in Red Arrow Park Monday afternoon to encourage them to vote for her in the Republican Party primary election Aug. 13.\n\nRaveendran was the first Republican candidate to challenge Tammy Baldwin, and will run against Eric Hovde inthe GOP primary. A U.S. citizen who immigrated from India and lives in Stevens Point, Raveendran worked as a nurse and is now at UW-Stevens Point, earning her degree in political science.\n\nShe said she's concerned about food and gas prices, border security and homelessness.\n\n“I just want to do what I can because I do not trust any politicians,” she said.\n\nRaveendran said she wasn't invited to speak at the convention and has received several phone calls from Republican leaders, asking her to step down and support Hovde.\n\n“I said I cannot do that, because I do not want to betray the people,” Raveendran said.\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Gina Lee Castro\n\nWisconsin Republican Chairman Brian Schimming praises J.D. Vance as VP pick\n\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming praised Trump’s vice presidential pick Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance as someone with a “compelling personal story” and said Vance’s Midwest ties could help Wisconsin Republicans.\n\n“As with most swing states, we’re looking for surrogates. We’re looking for people who can come in and identify with voters quickly,” Schimming said. “And he can do that.\"\n\n“That’s why it makes a difference,” Schimming added. “He can roll into a state like Wisconsin and immediately click. So anytime he wants to come to Wisconsin, I will put him in the car and personally drive him around.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s opposition to abortion, Schimming said Trump is the candidate “driving the issues and driving where people are.”\n\n“Donald Trump has not been laid back about saying, ‘Look, I’m not signing a national abortion ban,” Schimming said.\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nWarm weather cools off sales for Convention Fest\n\nWalking outside in near 90 degree weather isn't an ideal shopping environment, but that was the case for the first day of Convention Fest.\n\nMonday, dozens of vendors showed off their products or services to credentialed delegates, media and other officials.\n\nMadan Raj, founder and president of Bobbletopia, started his company in Omaha, Nebraska, four years ago and quickly moved to Milwaukee.\n\nRaj had several versions of Trump in presidential form, but also as William Wallace from the movie \"Braveheart,\" and the Trumpinator, inspired by the \"Terminator.\"\n\n“People have taken pictures of the Trump bobbleheads,” Raj said, adding he’s had a few sales but many people have opted to buy items later in the week, so they don’t have to carry it as long.\n\nRaj said he's been working with the Committee on Arrangements for the Republican National Committee to register for the event and drop off his inventory.\n\n“They have great staff behind the scenes who take care of all of that. They set up the tent, the tables were provided. All I had to really take care of was inventory, which I brought in,” Raj said. “We had to set up Thursday and Friday. Secret Service did their sweep on the weekend ... and today, just final setup.”\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nProtest zones draw few demonstrators\n\nZeidler Union Square, one of the city’s two designated protest zones, has been empty for most of Monday, except for a couple dozen security staff.\n\nThere’s been more dog-walkers than protesters, a security staffer said. A small group of about 15 people were in the park earlier in the day.\n\nHaymarket Square, another of the city’s two protest zones, had no protestors at 4 p.m. The platform has been quiet all day.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nVance gets official RNC nomination for vice president\n\nHours after former Trump announced U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance was his pick for vice president, the nomination became official at the RNC in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhen Vance entered the arena, he was greeted by cheers and chants of “J.D.” as well as “USA!”\n\nHis welcome seemed to be delayed by an apparent teleprompter malfunction that led to a jam band playing for at least 30 minutes.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\n50 Cent memes flood social media, RNC appearance rumored\n\nJournalists at CNN reported Monday afternoon on X that rap icon 50 Cent has spoken with Republican officials about making an appearance at the convention, according to people \"familiar\" with the situation.\n\nThe rapper and producer for hit television shows has been trending on social media lately following Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, survived a shooting in 2000. On the track “Many Men” from his 2003 album “Get Rich or Die Tryin,” 50 Cent raps about having enemies and people targeting him. The song has become a soundtrack for many on social media after the assassination attempt.\n\n50 Cent posted to X on Saturday his iconic album cover, edited with a picture of Trump instead.\n\n“Trump gets shot and now I’m trending,” he said.\n\nIn early June, 50 Cent and civil rights attorney Ben Crump appeared on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to advocate for more opportunities in the liquor industry. Speaking with CBS News at the time, 50 Cent said that he hadn't decided who he wanted to vote for in the upcoming election but could see Black men \"identifying with Trump.\"\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nRNC band steps up after apparent teleprompter malfunction\n\nA band was rocking out at Fiserv Forum after House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a teleprompter malfunction at the RNC.\n\nThe band played for about 30 minutes before the teleprompter started working properly again.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nRepublicans, equipment makers address manufacturing at RNC event\n\nMilwaukee-based Association of Equipment Manufacturers hosted a policy-focused event Monday with Republicans Gov. Glenn Youngkin, of Virgina; U.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin.\n\nA panel discussion addressed pro-growth economic policies, which Republicans say are necessary to bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.\n\nIt also highlighted the storied history that manufacturing and mining equipment manufacturer Komatsu have in Milwaukee.\n\nThe event was held at Komatsu’s mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee’s Harbor District.\n\nKomatsu builds some of the world’s largest mobile land machines. Its biggest mining shovel weighs nearly 4 million pounds and has a bucket the size of a two-car garage. In front of the company's mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee's Harbor District, there's a 60-foot-tall electric mining shovel and 850,000-pound truck on display.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse gets an RNC roll call shoutout\n\nWhen Brian Schimming, chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, welcomed convention-goers during the RNC roll call at Fiserv Forum on Monday afternoon, he gave a shoutout to the GOP’s Wisconsin roots.\n\n“One hundred and seventy years ago, this great party was founded down the road in Ripon, Wisconsin, in a little white schoolhouse,” Schimming said, flanked by former Gov. Scott Walker and others.\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse is yet more proof that there is indeed always a Wisconsin connection.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStreet vendor selling bloody Trump photo and pins for $5 each\n\nA T-shirt vendor is selling Trump merchandise, including a photo and pin of Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFor delegates and credentialed guests looking to get their hands on the golden Trump sneakers for $600, 365 Campaign is selling two pairs outside the Baird Center, sizes 6.5 and 7.5, for $600 each.\n\n“They’re very hard to come by,” manager Anthony Montgomery said. “They sell out quick.”\n\nMontgomery has a pair of his own.\n\n“I just wanted to see what it felt like to walk like President Trump,” Montgomery said. “This is the closest thing to it.”\n\nBefore coming to Milwaukee, Montgomery said the company was selling merchandise in Pennsylvania when Trump was nearly killed by an assassin.\n\n“It felt like a regular rally,” Montgomery said. “President Trump showed up, and I call it the seven-minute speech because that’s literally all he really had before they tried to take his life.”\n\nMontgomery said the shots sounded like fireworks but when he saw people running, that’s when he knew something serious happened.\n\n“I felt disrespected in a sense,” Montgomery said. “I felt like, 'How could they let something like this happen?'”Montgomery said he tried to keep his composure and help out people where they needed it.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nTensions rise between RNC protesters, anti-abortion group at Red Arrow Park\n\nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, an anti-abortion group, is demonstrating in Red Arrow Park, where protesters from the Coalition to March on the RNC are resting after their march.\n\nTensions are high between the anti-abortion group and those who disagree with them. But Coalition security guards formed a barrier around the group as they laid on the ground to demonstrate.\n\nThe group staged a “wedding” between the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party. A woman in white dress spattered with fake blood “married” a man wearing a pool noodle on his nose to represent an elephant trunk.\n\nA person was shouting through a bullhorn at close range to the group, and members of the group shouted back. One member activated a siren sound on his bullhorn.\n\nThis all occurred as speakers affiliated with the Coalition held their own rally feet away on the slab of concrete that in the winter serves as an ice rink.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBiden-Harris campaign criticizes Trump VP pick\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon criticized Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon.\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Dillon said in a statement.\n\nShe also condemned Vance’s stances on abortion, tax cuts and certification of the 2020 presidential election. Vance is staunchly against abortion but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe statement said the Biden-Harris ticket is “focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone and lowering costs” while the Trump-Vance ticket’s “harmful agenda will take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations.”\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler in a Monday statement said, “The stakes of this election just got impossibly higher” as a result of Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate.\n\n“Should Donald Trump win another term in the White House, there’s no question that J.D. Vance would put loyalty to Trump and the GOP’s extreme agenda over the country,” Wikler said. “In election after election, we’ve seen Wisconsinites reject the extreme, anti-freedom Trump-Vance agenda — and they’ll do it again this November.”\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTrump is officially nominated for president\n\nIt's official: Trump was officially nominated for president during the delegate roll call at the RNC Monday afternoon.\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, delivered the delegates that formally put the former president over the top, USA TODAY reported.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America,” he said.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump has his VP pick: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance\n\nA little over an hour before his vice presidential choice was set to be revealed, Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nVance will be \"strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond,\" Trump wrote.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC passes Fiserv Forum\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 passed the northern end of its march route a block from Fiserv Forum early Monday afternoon, crossing the Juneau Avenue bridge about 1:20 p.m.\n\nDespite its size, the group’s chants were largely inaudible to a reporter on the Deer District plaza, where music was playing and at least one interview was taking place over a loud speaker at one point.\n\nThe group stopped for a few minutes outside the entrance to the credentials-only “hard” security zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue. While they were there, their shouts mingled with music on the southeast end of the plaza.\n\nThe group had said its primary goal was to be within “sight and sound” of Fiserv Forum, and its route went right up against the fence that delineates the credentials-only “hard” zone from the security “footprint” where members of the public are able to enter.\n\nIts route took the group closer to Fiserv Forum than the city-designated demonstration area at Haymarket Square Park a bit farther north.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nParental rights, gender ideology take center stage in Heritage Foundation Policy Fest afternoon session\n\nHeritage Foundation researchers promoted traditional family values and bashed gender ideology during the afternoon panel of “Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future.”\n\nHeritage Foundation panelists Vice President of Domestic Policy Roger Severino, Senior Legal Fellow Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Research Associate for the Tech Policy Center Daniel Cochrane criticized the Biden administration's handling of Title IX and children's social media usage in a panel moderated by conservative personality Liz Wheeler in the Bradley Symphony Center.\n\n“We have to take back as parents our God-given right to parent our children, even when it's tough,” Perry said.\n\nBiden, in one of his first executive actions , expanded federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination in regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, including for transgender individuals.\n\nPerry said the first thing she’d like to see Trump do in office is revoke “all guidance” on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“From that first pebble, we see an avalanche of gender identity and orthodoxy in every system in America,” Perry said. “That is the primary responsibility, I think, of the next administration is to make sure that they don't sacrifice children on the altar of woke progressivism.”\n\nCochrane said gender ideology is spreading on platforms like Tik Tok. Panelists criticized youth access to inappropriate social media content and pornography. Cochran said sites like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube should enact age-verification requirements.\n\nPerry also said she wants Biden’s timeline on Title IX to remove expansions on gender ideology rescinded. She blamed teachers’ unions for “outsized influence” over educational policy agenda items like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ curriculum and hosting “drag queens for story hours.”\n\nLGBTQ+ experts say the Biden administration’s expansion of LGBTQ+ protections and gender affirming care has helped combat harassment and discrimination. His policies have earned him the endorsement of LGBTQ+ advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nCombating deep fakes in politics requires quick action but not over-reacting\n\nThe challenges posed by deep fakes in election campaigns are global, but on Monday, Microsoft Corp. addressed them as part of the RNC.\n\nDeep fakes are images, videos or audio recordings convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say. One example in the presidential campaign was a fake voice message claiming to be President Joe Biden urging New Hampshire voters not to take part in the primary election.\n\nMonday at noon, as part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft offered free training in identifying and addressing deep fakes, especially in political campaigns.\n\n“We’re very concerned about what the next few months look like leading into the U.S. election,” Ginny Badanes, general manager of Democracy Forward said in a Journal Sentinel interview.\n\n“I would say anywhere a political leader is talking publicly and being recorded, there’s a risk of that recording being manipulated to make it look like they said something at that event they didn’t say,” she added.\n\nA poorly made deep fake may be easy to identify. Voices that sound robotic, or unnatural speech patterns, are signs. Strange eye movements and a lack of blinking are other indicators. But detection is more difficult in a professionally made deep fake, and some of the most convincing are in local elections, according to Microsoft.\n\nA quick response, pointing people to the correct information, is important when a political campaign has been attacked with a deep fake or other type of false narrative.\n\nHere are some tips from Microsoft:\n\nInitiate an immediate response, based on factual data, that dismantles the falsehoods without amplifying them.\n\nTo start, evaluate the content’s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike AI-generated parodies of their candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech.\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. But if the content crosses ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nBy promptly addressing false claims, you establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent misinformation.\n\nIf it’s a deep-fake video of a candidate, typically there’s a genuine video on which the fake was based. “That is one of the best antidotes, to get that out publicly, and say it’s the real video,” Badanes said.\n\nWhen deep fakes come with a high probability of losing votes, options include calling a press conference, issuing a public statement, or asking for a retraction. When there's a medium risk, options include activating supporter networks to push back, and considering a public statement. Low risk: Do nothing, so as not to amplify the falsehoods.\n\nHere’s a Microsoft quiz to test your abilities: Real Or Not (realornotquiz.com)\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nSevere thunderstorms expected for Milwaukee area in late afternoon and evening\n\nThe National Weather Service says more severe thunderstorms will move into the Milwaukee area late this afternoon and into the evening, peaking between 6 and 10 p.m.\n\nSevere winds, heavy rain and hail are the main threats, though Milwaukee County has a 2-4% chance for tornadoes. Storms are expected to be stronger along Wisconsin's border with Illinois.\n\nThe outdoor Convention Fest is scheduled to end at 5:30 p.m., and the evening official session inside Fiserv Forum runs from 5:45 p.m. until 10 p.m. That means delegates and media are likely to be indoors when severe weather comes through.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRNC uses influencers to reach young voters\n\nThe RNC is using a new method to reach youth voters this week — more than 70 influencers. Youth Advisory Council Co-Chairs Brilyn Hollyhand, 18, and CJ Pearson, 21, lead the effort.\n\n“Young people don't trust billboards, they don't trust pamphlets, they don't trust direct mail, they don’t trust TV ads. They trust people,” Pearson said. “If we can mobilize influencers to fight for America, to come to our side, we can mobilize legions of young people as well.”\n\nAmong them are former Miss Universe judge and social media personality Emily Austin, Mikel Simmons of Bravo’s “Southern Hospitality” and Xaviaer DuRousseau, a creator with conservative organization PragerU.\n\nDuRousseau said influencers help bridge the trust gap between candidates and voters.\n\n“We are able to make the information palatable,” DuRousseau said. “We've gone through all the fluff, we've seen the details. Now, here is a summarized version from me, an influencer, someone that you trust.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention Committee last month announced similar plans to five influencers access credentials in Chicago.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nAnti-abortion protesters rally in Haymarket Square\n\nAbout 50 anti-abortion protesters rallied at Haymarket Square Park around noon.\n\nAmong them was Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director. He said the initial goal was to encourage the Republican Party to strengthen their stance on abortion.\n\nBut after the RNC platform committee announced a softened stance on abortion, Sande turned from “frustrated” to “angry.”\n\n“The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,” he said.\n\nHe said some who find the GOP abortion stance objectionable may stay home from the polls. Others will vote but will avoid enthusiastically door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts, he said.\n\nHe said even if Trump were elected, it would be difficult to pass the kind of anti-abortion legislation he wants — such as a ban at conception or “fetal personhood” protections.\n\nFetal personhood would grant embryos and fetuses legal and constitutional protections that are equivalent to the person who's carrying them at every stage of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts have said any recognition of fetal personhood could have ripple effects far beyond a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions, potentially outlawing in vitro fertilization, embryonic stem cell research and some forms of birth control.\n\n“This is really taking the air out of the tires,” Sande said. “Literally and emotionally, it’s deflating to the base.”\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nCheese curd vendor at Convention Fest brought over 360 pounds of cheese\n\nThere's one vendor at Convention Fest that will undoubtedly be popular: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds, owned and operated by David and Sanita Hofer. They've been in business for 16 years, working about 60 fairs and festivals in the Milwaukee area each season.\n\n\"This is not our first rodeo,\" David Hofer said about introducing out-of-state visitors to cheese curds. He has a sign set up next to the tent that explains the process of making cheese curds.\n\nHofer likes fried and raw cheese curds equally, but \"every time I think I'm getting sick of eating fried curds, I find myself still eating fried curds.\"\n\nHofer first learned about Convention Fest by reading about it in the paper. They went to a trade show, and convention organizers asked them a few months ago if they'd be interested in being a vendor.\n\nHofer, who was working the booth Monday afternoon with his two daughters, was getting customers even before Convention Fest officially started at 2 p.m. And they expected to keep selling even after the event wraps up at 5:30 p.m.\n\nHe found a calculator and estimated he brought 360 pounds of cheese for the curds to Convention Fest, plus 60 pounds of sliced cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches. Those cheeses come from Ellsworth and Plymouth, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I'm just hoping that we can represent the great state of Wisconsin with high-quality food,\" Hofer said.\n\nThere were plenty more Wisconsin vendors outside, including a beef stick stand. Drink Wisconsinbly also had tents and displayed not-so-political signs, such as \"I support fish frys,\" \"Pro-beers & bratwursts\" and \"Vote yes: Brandy old fashioneds.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee City Attorney Evan Goyke observes march\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke and former deputy city attorney Adam Stephens, who's working for the city this week as special counsel, observe the march from the front.\n\nGoyke declined to answer questions. He previously told the Journal Sentinel that he and Stephens would be observing protest activity around the RNC throughout the week.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been a large law enforcement presence around the march. A unit of officers on bicycles were seen staying a couple blocks away from the demonstration.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman has said he wants the department to be largely \"invisible\" when it comes to policing mass demonstrations during the RNC.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC begins, route to go through downtown Milwaukee\n\nHundreds of people started marching at noon Monday.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC has a planned route of heading south on Water Street, across the Milwaukee River on Wells Street, before marching south on Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe group will then cross the river again and march north on Water Street to West Juneau Avenue, then south on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive before crossing the river again at West State Street.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nEvent staff near Haymarket Square are trained in de-escalation\n\nThe first two groups scheduled to speak at the Haymarket Square Park protest zone were no-shows.\n\nThat's according to Ashanti Hamilton, director of the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety (formerly the Office of Violence Prevention). He was at the zone to coordinate the speaker's platform and a group of event security staff in orange shirts.\n\nMost of the staff were community organizers trained in de-escalation and mediation tactics, Hamilton said.\n\n\"These are the most experienced folks that we have in crowd control,\" he said.\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 15 speakers were scheduled to take to the platform, he said. Because the park was nearly empty, at least one group of protesters stopped by, then promptly left, Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the Trump assassination attempt changed the potential protest landscape.\n\n\"I'm just hoping, now that we have heightened tensions, that those things don't boil over into any of the demonstration activities,\" he said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBay View restaurant to donate portion of sales to progressive organizations this week\n\nBay View restaurant Heirloom MKE, 2378 S. Howell Ave., said it will donate a portion of its sales this week to several progressive organizations:\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People\n\nGLAD: GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund\n\n“A reminder to our customers that Heirloom MKE is nowhere near the security perimeters of the RNC,” an Instagram post read. “Some might say we are in the perfect place to stay out of the chaos.”\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez\n\nOnly a handful of people in Zeidler Union Square, and most are security staff\n\nNo police presence at the protest zone located in Zeidler Union Square so far. About a handful of security staff wearing bright orange T-shirts are scattered throughout the area.\n\nAt around 11:40 a.m., three people at the square's pavilion briefly read testimonies from both local and national victims of gun violence, attracting one spectator.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nRipon's Little White Schoolhouse replica at RNC built by high schoolers\n\nA replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, is on display at the RNC's Convention Fest outside the Baird Center and Panther Arena.\n\nA one-third scale replica of the schoolhouse, constructed by Ripon High School students for parades and city events, will be on display at the RNC.\n\nThe full-size schoolhouse was Ripon's first public school, built in 1853, and is now more popularly known as the Little White School House, the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\"We are so excited to have a way to showcase the incredible history that took place here in Ripon 170 years ago,\" Ripon Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mandy Kimes told the Fond du Lac Reporter. \"This is Ripon’s unique history and contribution to the development of our nation.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee firefighter staffing double for RNC, union president says\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department is staffing about double its normal number of workers for the RNC.\n\nEric Daun, the president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said that, on an average day, there are about 200 firefighters staffed around the city, but there’s “well over 200” additional staff for the convention.\n\n“I would say the members are being taxed to the max of their capacity,” Daun said. “We’re doing it to the best of their ability. I’ll say that.”\n\nHe said the department is getting help from suburban Milwaukee County departments. However, unlike with the police, there’s no out-of-state help.\n\n“Stress is at a higher level, but it is what it is. It’s to be expected,” Daun said.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said the department had responded to a handful of minor incidents Monday morning. Overall, he said the day was going well.\n\n\"We got a lot of the kinks out on Sunday,\" he said. \"We're feeling OK with things out here.\"\n\n— David Clarey\n\nAbout 500 people gather for Coalition the March on the RNC rally at Red Arrow Park before march\n\nWith a rally underway ahead of the noon march by the Coalition the March on the RNC, a crowd of about 500 has gathered at Red Arrow, so far smaller than what organizers said they anticipated, about 5,000.\n\nAttendees have come from across the country to bring attention to a range of issues.\n\nCharlie Berg came from Minneapolis with the Climate Justice Committee. He said the Democratic and Republican parties have both failed to address climate change.\n\n“We need a platform and policy that is actually going to address climate change and we can’t do that so long as we have U.S. militarism, so long as we have reliance on fossil fuels, and so long as those corrupt parties are in power,” Berg said.\n\nBadger Van Grey, who is hosting a sign-making station, said the most common signs have included a focus on immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, “We can no longer afford the rich” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nA handful of counter-protesters are at Red Arrow, deriding LBGTQ+ people and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA speaker with the group said he was from Indiana and identified himself only as Jim with Street Preachers. The man protested outside the 2016 RNC in Cleveland and has appeared on college campuses for many years.\n\nSome march attendees stood around the small group to film them but there were few interactions.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\nJournal Sentinel's JR Radcliffe, Kristin Brey preview RNC in Milwaukee\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC protesters speak about Gaza, abortion rights\n\nAs hundreds gathered in Red Arrow Park Monday, Kobi Guillory, a Chicago teacher and central committee member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization, kicked off the press conference with a focus on Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Our government, in a bipartisan initiative, is committing genocide in Palestine with our tax dollars and reinforcing daily militarism,” Guillory said.\n\nAhead of the march, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said he expected the top issues for marchers would be abortion rights and standing with Palestinian people.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has retaliated with an intense military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including women and children, medical authorities in Gaza have said.\n\nSeveral people told the Journal Sentinel they had come from Atlanta and Minnesota with Gaza top of mind.\n\nVictoria Hinckley, who said she was expelled from the University of South Florida for her involvement in a Palestinian-solidarity encampment there, attended the march with others from Students for a Democratic Society. Hinckley’s remarks Monday focused on abortion.\n\n“These attacks on reproductive freedom and abortion access are harshly felt in the South, especially in states like Florida and Texas with the emergence of anti-abortion bills banning abortion within the first few weeks of pregnancy,” she said.\n\n— Rory Linnane and Ashley Luthern\n\nMilwaukee 70-something couple comes to march against RNC\n\nBill Nantell and girlfriend Kathleen Joynt, both in their mid-70s who live near downtown Milwaukee, said they came to Red Arrow Park Monday to march against Republican policies on abortion, racism and senior benefits.\n\n\"I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans,\" Nantell said. \"This is not a Republican Party I am familiar with at all.\"\n\nNantell said he would like President Joe Biden to step aside for a younger candidate. But he will vote for him if Biden stays in.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nStreet evangelists among the few at Haymarket Square Park\n\nA handful of street evangelists stood in a strip of shade on Haymarket Square Park, at North King Drive and West McKinley Avenue, holding signs with Bible verses.\n\nOne man with a microphone was preaching to a near-empty park.\n\nWarren Marquardt of Polk City, Florida, affiliated with Calvary Chapel, said he attends four or five public events a year to spread his message. He recognized the other preachers as regulars at big events.\n\n“There’s no politician that’s going to come on the scene and make it all right,” he said.\n\nStirling Long of Dawsonville, Georgia, affiliated with Providence Bible Church, a Reformed Baptist church, held a sign that read, “Are you going to Heaven? Free test.”\n\nAsked about the Republican Party’s softer abortion stance in its RNC platform, Long said he would not “vote for baby killers.”\n\n“They’re doing it for votes,” he said. “This is a game.”\n\nMarquardt also distanced himself from the GOP stance on abortion, saying, “God will do what God wants to do,” no matter the president in office.\n\nElsewhere along the security perimeter, streets were quiet. Event security staff in orange T-shirts milled around chatting. Police boats trawled the river.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\n'Reagan' movie posters showing up around RNC security perimeter\n\nPosters for an upcoming movie on President Ronald Reagan have popped up around the security perimeter in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Reagan\" stars Dennis Quaid and is scheduled to be released Aug. 30.\n\nThe RNC is also screening \"Reagan\" all day every day in the Regency Ballroom at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center for convention-goers.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nConvention Fest sets up outside Panther Arena\n\nMid-Monday morning, white vendor tents were going up between the Baird Center and Panther Arena for Convention Fest, where those with credentials can experience local food and products.\n\nAmong the 100 local businesses participating in Convention Fest are Immy's African Cuisine and Scrima's Pizza. A Wisconsin cheese curds tent was in a prime location.\n\nIn the center of the road stood a replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, considered to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump expected to announce his VP pick Monday afternoon\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier says Trump confirmed to him he’ll announce his running mate Monday.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nTop names for the spot include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But it’s not out of the question that Trump will make a more surprising pick.\n\nTrump had previously hinted he would announce his VP at the RNC, though that announcement typically came a few days before the convention in campaigns.\n\n— Hope Karnopp and USA TODAY's David Jackson\n\nArtists stage live climate change installation next to RNC security perimeter\n\nA team of actors and artists from Climate Power, a strategic communications organization that seeks to educate Americans on climate change, debuted a public art installation in the windows of the Germania Building, 135 W. Wells St., Monday morning. It’s located just outside the RNC's hard security perimeter.\n\nThe exhibit features five street-facing window displays depicting life-sized scenes of people affected by extreme weather situations, including excessive heat and flooding. Actors will bring to life the experiences of real extreme weather survivors who Climate Power and its partner artists have interviewed.\n\nNew York-based artist Annie Saunders said the installation is inspired by museum dioramas.\n\n“The aesthetic of a diorama is recognizable; it’s usually for history, it’s for prehistory, it’s for things that were frozen in time and are not happening anymore ...,” she said. “So, using that aesthetic to represent something that is happening but is being willfully ignored is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe first window of the exhibit depicts a child’s playroom affected by extreme heat. A small plastic chair is melting, crayon wax is pooling on the table, construction paper pinned to the wall is fading, and the wallpaper is curling at the edges. An actor tries frantically to start an air conditioner.\n\nAnother window shows men in suits sitting around an office table for a business meeting with their heads literally stuck in a pile of sand in the middle of the table. File cabinets in the hallway leading to the meeting room are strewn about and black tar leaks out of them.\n\nSaunders said this represents politicians and officials who “have their heads in the sand” when it comes to the effects of climate change and choose to accept donations from oil and gas companies.\n\n“The problem with climate change is it’s so conceptual, and the language is so saturated ...,” Saunders said. “It’s being communicated with words, which are fundamentally abstract objects, and you have to hear the word and then have a visual or an emotional response.”\n\nDue to the installation’s proximity to the RNC, Saunders said Climate Power hopes to send a message to elected officials and people in power. She hopes the images stick with officials and help them realize that they too could be the victims of extreme weather.\n\n“Extreme heat and these issues do not discriminate on the basis of wealth and power,” Saunders said. “It’s coming for everyone.”\n\nSaunders and the Climate Power team have been working on the installation for over two months and have been setting it up on the Germania Building’s first floor for five days. Passersby will be able to see it through the windows all day Monday and until about noon Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHundreds already gathering at Red Arrow Park for march on RNC\n\nOrganizers with the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 are setting up Monday morning at Red Arrow Park, where they plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. and rally at 11 a.m. before marching in protest outside the RNC.\n\nSeveral hundred people already had gathered at the park by 10 a.m. and the event is expected to draw more than 5,000 people.\n\nOrganizers plan to march within a block of the convention’s main site, Fiserv Forum. They have remained committed to the plan despite heightened anxiety about security in the city after the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nThe coalition plans to avoid the credentials-only “hard” security zone around the RNC but plans to enter the “soft” security zone. While the city has a sanctioned march route in the soft zone, the group plans to take its own route to get closer to Fiserv.\n\nOn Friday, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said the group had a \"handshake agreement\" with city officials that the group would be allowed to use its own route. City officials didn’t confirm such an agreement but confirmed they were working with the group to ensure marchers could safely exercise their rights.\n\nThe “soft” security zone has special rules under the city’s extraordinary event ordinance, including a ban on certain items like non-plastic water bottles, umbrellas with a metal tip, bike locks, and bags larger than 18-by-13-by-7 inches.\n\nThe Coalition consists of local and national organizations, including the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Anti-War Committee.\n\nWhile the groups' individual missions vary, the Coalition's shared priorities include fighting for reproductive rights, standing with Palestinians and defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ people. Many organizers are also unsatisfied with the Democratic Party and plan to protest the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nMajor Goolsby's teams with Broken Bat Brewing to release Screamin' Eagle Lager\n\nIf there's a official beer of the RNC, it might be at Major Goolsby's.\n\nThe well-known sports bar, just on the outside of the convention hard security zone, partnered with Broken Bat Brewing Company to release Screamin' Eagle Lager.\n\nThe restaurant describes the beer as \"crisp, refreshing.\" It's available in 16-ounce cans \"until we sell out!\"\n\n\"A beautiful spin on our traditional Eagle, all artwork was down by our very own Orissa Camille,\" the restaurant wrote on Facebook. \"Get them while they last!\"\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nLong lines form at security checkpoint outside RNC\n\nA long line of cars and other vehicles had formed by 8 a.m. along North Water Street, leading up to a security checkpoint on West Michigan Street near North Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe cars were waiting to go through one of the five security checkpoints along the edge of the security zone surrounding the RNC.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel were instructing drivers at the checkpoint on West Michigan Street to open the hoods of their vehicles, roll down all windows and remain in their vehicles. Once at the checkpoint, law enforcement opened each vehicle’s trunk to check inside and walked a canine around the vehicle.\n\nFrom near the front of the line at 7:45 a.m., Olivia Rivers of Racine said she had been waiting in line about an hour and a half. She works at the 3rd Street Market Hall and had gotten in line about 6:20 a.m. She was supposed to start work at 7.\n\n“The Market Hall told us we’d need an extra hour of travel time,” she said. “I didn’t figure it would take this long.”\n\nBritney Carter of Milwaukee also works inside the security zone and was late to work Monday morning because of the delays.\n\n“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said.\n\nShe works at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and waited in line for about 40 minutes.\n\nAvery Leo, who lives in the security zone, also didn’t expect the long wait and said he would consider taking a different route to get home.\n\n“It’s annoying,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nDowntown RNC 'soft' security zone quiet\n\nThe downtown “soft” security zone/footprint where pedestrians can freely cross inside, was quiet Monday morning.\n\nPedestrians with various levels of credentials — or not — walked through and police at the fences denoting the credentials-only “hard” zone seemed relaxed. A few vehicles moved through the area.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMicrosoft has 'deep fakes' training at noon and 5 p.m.\n\nAs part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft Corp. is offering free training in Milwaukee on Monday aimed at helping political campaigns, activists and party officials identify and address deep fakes, which are images or videos convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say.\n\nThe sessions, focused on women, democracy and elections, are at noon and 5 p.m. at Northern Lights, an event venue at 106 W. Seeboth St. Speakers will include Ginny Badanes, general manager of the Democracy Forward campaign; and Republican U.S. Reps. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma; Burgess Owens of Utah; and Kat Cammack of Florida.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRon Johnson chart credited as difference-maker in Trump assassination attempt\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson may have played a serendipitous role in Trump surviving the Saturday assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat’s because Trump, as he detailed in an interview with the New York Post, turned his head slightly the moment before shots were fired to read a chart on illegal immigration. The source of that chart? Johnson, who spoke about it on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier.\n\nIn an interview with Baier, the senator said he initially showed a chart on illegal immigration to Trump on a plane ride to a rally in Green Bay. The senator said that Trump liked the chart, and his team took it, tweaked it and used it at the Saturday rally.\n\nA bullet pierced Trump's right ear, but he wasn't seriously injured.\n\n“I’m happy to have been of service there,” Johnson said on the Fox News program.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nPolice make two arrests Sunday near RNC security zone, welcome party\n\nPolice made two arrests near the Republican National Convention grounds and its events Sunday.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said both incidents involved drunk people. One person was arrested near the Summerfest grounds, near where a convention welcome party was being held, and another was arrested after driving into a security barrier near the convention.\n\n“The events overnight were described to me as really uneventful,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “There’s been a lot of preparation that’s gone on into the planning of this political convention and the bulk of that planning has been directly involved in and around the area of public safety.”\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: It'll be a hot, humid day, with a chance of storms Monday night\n\nThe weather forecast looks hot for the convention's first day.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 89 degrees around 5 p.m., with a heat index of 95, according to the National Weather Service. Heat indices in the 90s are expected between 1 and 8 p.m. High humidity is also in the forecast throughout the day, causing things to feel \"uncomfortable,\" said Milwaukee-Sullivan NWS meteorologist Marcia Cronce.\n\nThe heat and humidity should feel similar to Sunday, when Milwaukee County was under a heat advisory. However, a heat advisory isn't expected to be issued Monday because heat indices will be just below 100 degrees instead of at or over 100, Cronce explained. Still, the Weather Service urges people to stay hydrated, limit time outside and take other precautions to prevent heat-related illness.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are possible between 7 p.m. and midnight, with chances peaking at 62% around 9 p.m. Some storms could be severe, Cronce said, with damaging winds being the main threat.\n\nHeavy rain, hail and even tornadoes are possible, Cronce added. The risk for severe storms is more likely near the Illinois border. Brief, heavy downpours are likely but shouldn't stay over single areas for extended periods.\n\nThe hot weather should subside by Tuesday after a cold front moves in overnight, Cronce said.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Monday\n\nThe first official session of the convention starts at 12:35 p.m. and runs until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m.\n\nHowever, the day is littered with events before and after the official sessions.\n\nThe events kick off at 8 a.m., with The Heritage Foundation’s policy-centric event called the Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future and state delegation breakfasts throughout the early morning. Other events include things like a screening of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events.\n\nThe City Channel will broadcast the Republican National Convention beginning at 6 p.m. Monday. It'll air 24/7 and end at midnight Friday. Viewers can watch via Spectrum Cable on Channel 25 as well as on the “Livestream 1” feed.\n\nOther coverage will be available through Spectrum News and Fox News Media.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; group receptions; groups like Moms for Liberty, the American Jewish Committee and the European Union will host events; and there will be more movie screenings, too.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson strikes tone of unity\n\nIn a briefing outside City Hall early Monday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he would avoid focusing on political differences in light of the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nJohnson, a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, instead struck a tone of unity.\n\n“While Democrats and Republicans differ substantially on how we get there, the fact of the matter is … that we all want people of this country to succeed,” he said. “We want families in Milwaukee to have the opportunity to thrive. We want financial stability. We want peace, we want growth, we want health for citizens here, across our state and across our country.”\n\nJohnson also said he thought Biden was “showcasing leadership” in the wake of the attack on Trump by pausing political ads and events.\n\nHe also acknowledged the presidential election rematch between Trump and Biden in November.\n\n“Although the president may not be engaging in political activity in this specific moment in light of what’s happened, I’ve got no doubt that those things will continue,” Johnson said. “Obviously, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago next month and the president will have the opportunity to showcase the difference between his policies, what he’s done, what he intends to do for the United States and its people in the future.”\n\nHe said he was looking forward to serving as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention and working to ensure Biden wins a second term in November.\n\nJohnson said he felt “great” about having the RNC in the city, saying he wanted the event to serve as a stepping stone toward further growth.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nRNC security plan 'strengthened,' Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service has \"strengthened\" its security plan in the wake of Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement Monday morning.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Cheatle’s statement said.\n\n“In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump's detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nThe statement comes a day after the Secret Service’s RNC coordinator, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, said the agency was “not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans.”\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Cheatle said the security plans for events like the RNC are “designed to be flexible.”“As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee,” she said.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny after a gunman was able to shoot and injure Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania from a nearby rooftop. One man, Corey Comperatore, was killed and two people were injured, and Secret Service snipers killed the gunman, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick. Asked whether a running mate would join Trump on stage Monday, Bossie said: \"I don't get ahead of him, but that's — the plan is, it's imminent, for certain.\"\n\nTrump’s motorcade arrived Sunday night at the Pfister Hotel, where many expect he'll be staying.\n\nSecret Service agents lined the perimeter and eyed the surrounding rooftops as dozens of SUVs pulled up to the storied hotel.\n\nTrump, however, could not be spotted exiting his vehicle. A tent was waiting outside the entrance, and security quickly pulled the curtains shut.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC 2024 will continue as planned Monday\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route Monday.\n\nOn Friday, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with the Milwaukee Police Department and the city attorney’s office, though city officials didn't confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed the route with the city Saturday night.\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. Monday, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at noon. The group currently only plans to march Monday.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R.

Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC. Those attendees already have credentials to get inside the convention venues.\n\nIn other words, you can't buy a ticket to get into the convention if you're a member of the public.\n\nBut there are other RNC-related events that are open to the public. And, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. Fox News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, in 2024?\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago — less than 100 miles south of the RNC — from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/16/rnc-2024-convention-live-updates-in-milwaukee-news-schedule-events/74403453007/", "title": "RNC 2024 convention Day 2 review in Milwaukee: Trump returns", "text": "Here's a full review of Day 2 of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nAmid a host of events Tuesday, five Columbus, Ohio, police officers shot and killed a Milwaukee man just under a mile from the RNC's security perimeter.\n\nAt Fiserv Forum, the convention's center, a long list of speakers took the stage at Tuesday's session.\n\nIt followed the RNC's first day, which included former President Donald Trump officially winning the nomination and choosing Sen.

The air conditioning was set at full blast.\n\n“But I like the cold,” Ellison said.\n\nIt’s his first time as a delegate, Ellison said.

Notably, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, who weren't originally scheduled to speak, rallied the crowd around a message of unity. RNC co-chair Michael Whatley adjourned the convention at 10:24 p.m.\n\n(10:26 p.m.)\n\n—Tristan Hernandez and Mary Spicuzza\n\nPfister Hotel, where Trump is believed to be staying during the RNC, might be haunted\n\nThe Pfister Hotel, where Trump is believed to be staying during the RNC, might be haunted.\n\nLegend has it that a ghost lingers at the Milwaukee hotel, which was built 1893 by Guido Pfister and his son, Charles, billed at the time as the \"Grand Hotel of the West.\"\n\nRead more\n\n(10:21 p.m.)\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\nMobile billboards call for release of Hamas hostages\n\nThe faces of U.S. citizens kidnapped by Hamas flashed outside Red Arrow Park Tuesday night.\n\nSeven LED trucks parked along Water Street urged American politicians to “BRING THEM HOME.”\n\nThe advertisements were sponsored by the Israeli-American Council, a pro-Israeli advocacy organization.

We've got to put on the red, white and blue jersey and come together as Americans,” Hovde said, adding the “inflammatory rhetoric of divisiveness” is “tearing up” our country.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, the Biden-Harris campaign canceled counterprogramming events Sunday and Monday and pulled down advertisements.\n\nIn a Tuesday morning press conference, the campaign resumed its messaging against Republicans, hitting the Trump-Vance ticket on abortion and union issues.\n\nAsked if it was the right move for Democrats to pull their advertisements and cancel events, Hovde said ”whatever can lower the rhetoric and the tension in our country is good on both sides.”\n\n(10:08 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nWhere are the Trump children during the RNC?\n\nFrom business to politics, Trump has famously appointed his children to high-ranking roles in his ventures.\n\nBut this week his daughter, Ivanka, and his wife, Melania, have been noticeably absent during one of the most public moments of Trump's latest presidential campaign.\n\nNeither were in the audience Monday night, when Trump was both formally confirmed as the GOP presidential nominee and made his first appearance after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nRead more\n\n(10:01 p.m.)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nRudy Giuliani takes a fall at the 2024 RNC\n\nRudy Giuliani took a tumble at the convention, tripping while holding an Osmo camera Tuesday inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nGiuliani, who had his New York law license revoked earlier this month, had to be helped up but appeared to be OK.\n\nGiuliani, the ex-New York City mayor and personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump, addressed his fall on X (formerly Twitter) Tuesday night.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:45 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nHandful of high-end restaurants were closed\n\nA few high-end restaurants were closed to the public Tuesday night.\n\nBlack Chevy Suburbans with Virginia license plates were spotted outside Ardent, 1749-1751 N. Farwell Ave.\n\nA group of people, one wearing an RNC lanyard, were photographed heading into the high-end restaurant, which has received seven James Beard Award nominations under chef-owner Justin Carlisle.\n\nAn Ardent employee couldn't \"confirm nor deny\" whether the restaurant hosted any VIPs for dinner, but it was closed to the public Tuesday.\n\nHarbor House, a Bartolotta restaurant at 550 N. Harbor Dr. on Lake Michigan, was also listed as closed on Google and a source confirmed the restaurant would be closed to the public Tuesday.\n\nBacchus, another Bartolotta restaurant, at 925 E.

Farwell Ave.\n\nManager Jose Jimenez remembers his delivery driver telling him he needed to drive through the security checkpoints. But Tuesday, the delivery driver had car issues and delivery has been closed for the night.\n\n“It cuts a lot of business,” Jimenez said.\n\nLike a lot of businesses on the east side, it has been slow.\n\n“It’s been pretty slow since yesterday,” Jimenez said. “Usually Tuesdays is busy … the bar is filled up.”\n\nZaffiro’s has increased staff for the week in case things change.\n\n“I just dismiss people if it’s slow,” Jimenez said.\n\n(9:01 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nEast side conservative view on RNC, politics\n\nRick Paikowski was drinking a White Claw at Wolski’s Tavern, 1836 N. Pulaski St., with one other person in the quiet Milwaukee landmark.\n\n“I’m the last Paikowski left on the east side,” he said with a wide grin.\n\nPaikowski is conservative but “I keep it low-key.”\n\nHe thinks Republicans from the convention aren’t venturing out because they “know what city they’re in,”meaning a deep-blue city.\n\n“It’ll be good in the end,” Paikowski said of the convention. “I give them a lot of credit for choosing Milwaukee.\"\n\nBut Paikowski is enjoying the convention.\n\n“I know most of my neighbors don’t,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nWhile much of the talk the last few days has been about dialing down the heat on the rhetoric, Paikowski said, for years before Trump, the political conversation has been intense.\n\n“That’s where we’re at,” Paikowski said. “The political atmosphere is so volatile.”\n\nAfter Trump was shot Saturday, Paikowski said he wondered “is Milwaukee going to be a flashpoint for the next civil war?”\n\nBut even in a Democratic city, Paikowski has no plans to leave.\n\n“I enjoy hanging around the east side,” he said. “I’m not ready to give up.”\n\n(8:25 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden accuses Code Pink antiwar protester of assault during RNC\n\nWisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden on Tuesday accused an antiwar protester of assault during an incident in downtown Milwaukee, prompting a police investigation.\n\nCode Pink, the protest group involved in the incident, denied an assault took place and said Van Orden “tried to shove past” the activist.\n\nThe interaction occurred near the 400 block of East Wisconsin Avenue shortly after 11 a.m., according to the Milwaukee Police Department, which said it's investigating the incident as an assault.\n\nRead more\n\n(8:17 p.m.)\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nTrump returns on night two of the RNC\n\nTrump is back for the second night of the RNC in Milwaukee.\n\nAgain wearing a large bandage on his ear, he entered shortly after 8 p.m. Tuesday to a standing ovation and booming applause as \"What I Like About You\" blasted through Fiserv Forum.\n\n(8:05 p.m.)\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nWolski’s closing later than usual\n\nLooking to close Wolski’s? Be prepared to stay up late.\n\nBar close in Milwaukee is 4 a.m. for the RNC this week.\n\nWolski’s — the iconic Milwaukee bar at 1836 N. Pulaski St. known for its closing-time bumper stickers — is taking advantage of the bonus hours.\n\nBartender Johnny Ransdell announced last call around 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. If customers are sticking around, he said he’ll stay open until 4.\n\nBut out-of-towers and early risers need not worry: Ransdell is pretty generous with the “I closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\n“As long as you’re not an asshole, I’ll usually just give it to you before you leave,” he said.\n\n(8 p.m.)\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nAt RNC, Lambeau, Babydog and other K-9s steal the show\n\n(7:57 p.m.)\n\nTrump is seeing a familiar building outside his hotel window at the Pfister\n\nWhen Trump looks out his room at Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel this week, he'll see a familiar building. It looks a lot like his former hotel in Washington, D.C. In fact, it's an exact replica.\n\nConstruction on Milwaukee's federal courthouse began in 1892, the same year as the Old Post Office in Washington D.C.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the building that's on the eastern edge of Milwaukee's downtown and kitty-corner from the Pfister, was used for various government functions when it first opened in 1899 — as the Post Office, for state and federal courts, and even an office of weights and measures among others.\n\nToday, the building houses the federal courts as well as various federal offices. The space is immaculately maintained and visitors are awed by the architecture, which is Richardsonian Romanesque.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the same building went up the same year and was used for essentially the same purposes.\n\nIn 2013, the federal government leased the property for 60 years to a consortium headed by Trump, which developed the property into a hotel, the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., which opened in September 2016. In 2022, it became the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC.\n\nSo if the former president has some insomnia while in town for the RNC — the Pfister is purported to be haunted — he might take some comfort looking out on what sure looks like his old hotel.\n\n(7:26 p.m.)\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nBusiness as usual on Brady Street\n\nBrady Street showed no signs of MAGA on Tuesday.\n\nAlong the strip of bars and restaurants on the lower east side — just over a mile from the RNC — it’s been business as usual.\n\nA caravan of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supporters, honking their horns and waving American flags as they drove down the street, were Brady’s only happy-hour politickers.\n\nAt La Masa, 1300 E. Brady St., it was a regular Tuesday.\n\nThe Argentine restaurant didn’t staff up for the RNC, and there hasn’t been an influx of new customers.\n\n“No one over here really expected it to change,” manager Darian Emerson said.\n\nLike many Brady Street businesses, La Masa expects Brady Fest this weekend will be bigger for business than the RNC.\n\nNashville North, 1216 E. Brady St., which is normally closed Mondays, stayed open Monday night for the RNC, but business was slow.\n\nThe bar expects Tuesday night will be busier, as the regular crowd trickles in for blue grass and karaoke.\n\nManager Jake Garncarz said Nashville North is ready just in case some RNC visitors spill over from Fiserv. The bar staffed an extra bartender, and it’s stocked up on drinks.\n\n\"I don’t know what to expect, to be honest,” he said.\n\nBandit MKE, a vintage boutique at 1224 E. Brady St.,, seemed to have left a message for Trump in the window.\n\n“Nasty Woman in a Horrible City,” said a T-shirt in the display case.\n\n(7:16 p.m.)\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nMan wearing ski mask arrested outside Fiserv Forum Monday\n\nA 21-year-old man wearing a ski mask and carrying a “large tactical backpack in the street” was arrested Monday afternoon, blocks from Fiserv Forum on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon, according to Milwaukee police.\n\nThe man was initially noticed by U.S. Capitol Police. Officers from that department stopped him and determined he had a gun in his backpack, despite not having a concealed carry permit in Wisconsin or any other state, according to Milwaukee police.\n\nRead more\n\n(7:11 p.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nSheriff Joe Arpaio from Arizona spotted in Milwaukee\n\nJoe Arpaio, who was sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, for 24 years and made headlines for his immigration enforcement actions and treatment of prisoners, was spotted Tuesday morning, waiting to get into the Pfister Hotel in downtown Milwaukee for an RNC event.\n\nArpaio, 92, who styled himself \"America's Toughest Sheriff,\" has been hailed for being tough on immigration and also accused of civil rights violations and misconduct in office. He was convicted of federal contempt charge, a misdemeanor. Trump pardoned Arpaio, who has long been a Trump supporter.\n\n\"It was like a middle finger\" to those who charged him, Arpaio told a reporter from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel waiting in line with him Tuesday.\n\nArpaio said he hadn't seen Trump since he's been in Milwaukee and didn't know if he would. But he said he just saw Trump in Arizona last month.\n\n\"He gave me a kiss when he saw me,\" Arpaio said.\n\nAs Arpaio turned to go in the Pfister in a long security line, he was introduced to a police officer from Fort Worth, Texas, in Milwaukee to help with security. The officer was all smiles.\n\n\"It's an honor to meet you, Sheriff Joe,\" he said.\n\n(6:43 p.m.)\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nEric Hovde gets RNC speaking slot, attacks Baldwin, Biden and news media\n\nHovde used his time on the RNC’s stage to launch attacks against some of his favorite targets.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, Biden and the media all took the brunt of his criticism.\n\nHovde, a multimillionaire banking mogul, continued his attempts to tie Baldwin to Biden as the Madison Democrat has distanced herself from the president. Hovde said Democratic policies have “made us less safe at home.”\n\nHe pointed to the southern border and the fentanyl crisis as top issues. He said people’s budgets, the border and the world were more secure under Trump.\n\nRead more\n\n(6:40 p.m.)\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nMelania Trump conspicuously absent from RNC\n\nThere one was person noticeably absent from Trump's appearances at the RNC — former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nEarly reports indicted that she would be present to watch her husband accept his nomination for presidency Thursday, but she hasn't made an official appearance yet in Milwaukee.\n\nDespite Melania's absence, Amber Rose praised the former first lady during her speech on Day 1 of the convention.\n\n(6:40 p.m.)\n\n— Adrienne Davis\n\nMilwaukee weather 'more typical' for the remainder of the RNC\n\nMilwaukee weather will be in the upper-70s and low-80s for the remainder of the RNC, after Monday was hot and humid with temperatures in the high-80s and a nighttime thunderstorm hit convention goers between 9 p.m. to midnight.\n\n“It’s certainly going to be less active,” said John Gagan, meteorologist at the local National Weather Service office. “We’re going to be getting cooler, drier and more typical of Milwaukee weather this time of year.”\n\nTuesday still had some humidity, with temperatures in the low-80s. Temperatures were predicted to dip to the mid-60s at night.\n\nGagan said forecasts showed temperatures in the upper-70s or low-80s Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, with lows in the upper-50s.\n\nWednesday has a chance of showers between noon to 4 p.m. Thursday and Friday were predicted to be mostly sunny.\n\n“I would say it’s a touch on the cooler side of average,” Gagan said. “It’s not unusual to be in the mid-to-upper-70s this time of year. It’s probably a little more uncommon to have the weather we had the last three days with the humidity.”\n\n(6:19 p.m.)\n\n— Jordyn Noennig\n\nReince Priebus in speech: 'Milwaukee is a world-class city'\n\nHost Committee chairman Reince Priebus welcomed delegations to Wisconsin during his speaking slot Tuesday night, encouraging visitors to order a basket of cheese curds, drink a few beers and experience the \"beautiful beaches of Lake Michigan.\"\n\n\"Milwaukee is a world-class city, and Wisconsinites are some of the kindest people you'll ever meet,\" Priebus said.\n\nPriebus called Wisconsin \"the nation's premier battleground state\" and said \"we can make Wisconsin red again in 2024 and send Donald Trump back to the White House.\"\n\n(6:05 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMan protests for fathers' rights\n\nJames Taylor, 44, of Milwaukee is protesting for fathers' rights.\n\nOutside of the 3rd Street Market Hall, 275 W.

His shirt says in marker “here to clean up litter and trash, not to burn buildings #equalfathersrights.\"\n\nTaylor started collecting trash around 1 p.m. By 5 p.m., he had filled 14 30-gallon bags.\n\nTaylor said he has volunteered for the fathers' rights movement and has taken calls from distressed fathers.\n\n“Dads are important,” he said “Nobody’s fighting for us.”\n\n(6 p.m.)\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez and Gina Lee Castro\n\nMan in Joker costume near 3rd Street Market Hall makes balloon animal\n\nA man in a Joker costume was spotted walking up and down on North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. around 2:30 p.m., across the street from the 3rd Street Market Hall and the security checkpoint. He spent some of that time arguing with anti-Trump protesters.\n\nThe man, who said his character name is Consternation the Clown and his real name is Robert (he declined to provide his last name), said he makes balloon animals and hands out comic books.\n\n\"I want to inspire children to read, and comic books are a great way to do that because of both art and literature,\" he said.\n\nHe said he made a balloon animal for a woman on her way to an RNC event. She asked for a red, white and blue balloon, he said.\n\n\"Blue and white, made a scepter and a little red flower for a tie, and she loved it,\" Robert said.\n\n(5:50 p.m.)\n\n— Alec Johnson\n\nVance's wife makes a stop at Downtown Books\n\nVance's wife, Usha, stopped at Downtown Books, 624 N.

Water St., had a sign on its window that read \"Welcome Future Fake Electors.\" After the shooting, CEO Bill Penzey decided to take it down.\n\n\"There’s a time for clever and in the wake of it all and not wanting to cause extra hurt it seemed better not in the window,\" Penzey said in an email to the Journal Sentinel.\n\nBut it seems like that time has passed.\n\nThe welcome sign is back up, and Tuesday, Penzey put up another sign that reads \"'We the People' means everyone,\" with the word \"everyone\" colored in the style of LGBTQ+ pride flag.\n\nPenzey also wrote on the company Facebook page:\n\n\"We tried. We were ready to take a new path. But then Republicans just used the opening to become an even greater risk to the survival of our democracy.\n\n\"In the wake of Saturday’s events, Speaker of the House Johnson wants President Biden to stop talking about what Republicans did January 6. He wants the president to go silent on how dangerous they’ve become to everything that is America.

Well, almost.\n\nAt 814 W. Wisconsin Ave., the branch is adjacent to one of the vehicle screening spots of the RNC. People are still using the building as a cooling center, including police officers who needed respite from Monday’s high heat, said Melissa Howard, the library's community relations and engagement director.\n\nMilwaukee residents have still been the main patrons this week, Howard said. One change, though, is that cars can’t access the drive-though, so people have been walking up to pick up their books.\n\n“The focus has really been, 'Can we keep our services up and running as much as possible?'” Howard said.\n\nStaff members are playing a role, though, in capturing the local history by collecting photos, brochures and flyers of this week’s history-making event.\n\nSo far, library staff don’t plan to make any of its iconic TikToks related to the event.\n\nHoward hopes out-of-towners come to the library “to see what a big, beautiful institution that we have here in Milwaukee.”\n\n“I also hope that they're able to get outside of the security footprint and just see all the areas of Milwaukee that really make this place great,” Howard said\n\n(4:35 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby and Bridget Fogarty\n\nChair of Milwaukee County GOP talks Trump appearance at RNC, Milwaukee Republicans\n\nHilario Deleon, chairman of the Republican Party of Milwaukee County, said Trump's arrival at the convention Monday night was an emotional experience.\n\n\"I was wiping tears from my eyes,\" he told the Journal Sentinel at Wisconsin Media Row Tuesday afternoon. \"Just the fact that he came out, his presence there, it unified the Republican Party.\"\n\nDeleon watched the assassination attempt on Trump live on TV and was \"exhausted\" in the days after, fielding calls about how the RNC might be affected.\n\nDeleon said Republicans \"have a right to be pissed\" about the assassination attempt and criticized people who made jokes about the incident on social media.\n\n\"We didn't go out there and create chaos. Instead, we came together and we prayed,\" Deleon said. \"Let's try to lower the rhetoric, bring the country together.\"\n\nDeleon said it's \"not an easy task being the chairman of a minority party in a very blue area.\"\n\nThere are thousands of conservatives who aren't showing up, he said, who could make the difference in Wisconsin. The party needs to build relationships with people who may feel like their vote doesn't count, Deleon said.\n\nAsked for his Milwaukee recommendations, Deleon said to check out Lake Michigan, the Milwaukee Art Museum and local bars with great food.\n\n(4:30 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp and Hannah Kirby\n\nMore:They are Republicans in a Democratic city.

Ron Johnson pushes for school choice during Moms for Liberty town hall\n\nDuring Moms for Liberty’s “Giving Americans a Voice” Town Hall on Tuesday afternoon, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson pushed for school choice vouchers and called to move past large schools. He brought up the point in relation to the recent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\n“The initial interviews,” Johnson said, showed the shooter was “in probably a large school, being bullied all the time. I’m hoping if there’s one result from Moms for Liberty, and this is actually going to all be tied together here, is we start moving away from these massive, large schools.”\n\nThe shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, attended Bethel Park High School, which had 1,338 students enrolled during the 2023-2023 school year. That makes the school larger than the nationwide school enrollment average of 854 students and Pennsylvania’s average school size of 889 students.\n\n“During COVID-19, parents were looking over the shoulder of their kids and they're seeing that these large schools, these large bureaucracies, are getting completely out of control and unaccountable,” Johnson continued during the speech.\n\nAsked after the event if he was insinuating large schools were partially to blame for the shooting, Johnson said “there’s so much we don’t know” but that the kid was \"alienated\" and \"bullied,\" which he said “we’ve seen too many times in the past.”\n\nJohnson said Trump will speak about unity at the RNC as a result of the assassination attempt, which he said is a good thing.\n\n\"We have to unify and heal this nation,” Johnson told reporters. Asked if he blames rhetoric on the left for the shooting, Johnson told reporters “he blames the shooter” but said “vitriol on the left is not helpful.”\n\n(4 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nEmployees at restaurants just outside of perimeter struggle getting to work\n\nRyan Cooke, director of operations at the Milwaukee Brat House, 1013 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., said that the first day of the RNC brought his business logistical challenges, especially when it came to employees getting into work.\n\n\"We're a Milwaukee bar, tied to our cars a lot of the time, so we have staff biking, scootering, however they can get here,\" Cooke said.\n\nThe business struggled to fulfill meal deliveries and trash pickup due to convention-related road closures and security parameters.\n\nHowever, by Tuesday afternoon, Cooke said the Milwaukee Brat House was working through rough spots and picking up customers. After a busy July spent preparing for convention week, he hopes they'll see some financial benefits from the event.\n\n\"You know the first day, there's gonna be miscommunication and challenges, but they're starting to be remedied now,\" he said. \"The funny thing is it's gonna all be figured out by Thursday. Then, it's gonna be done.\"\n\n(3:35 p.m.)\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley talks about disproving Milwaukee's 'horrible city' label\n\n(3:15 p.m.)\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nSome restaurants less busy than expected\n\nAt 600 East Cafe, 600 E. Wisconsin Ave., owner Jill Ruffing extended business hours to accommodate RNC traffic. The cafe is usually open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. but will stay open until 5 p.m. during the convention.\n\nHowever, business has been slower than expected.\n\n\"We did the same volume yesterday that we would do in our normal 8 to 2 hours\" despite the extended hours, Ruffing said.\n\n\"I planned for double, triple, four times my business. I had to stock up on a lot of food because a lot of my suppliers are not coming into the city this week,\" she said.\n\nBefore the convention, the RNC Milwaukee Host Committee offered 600 East Cafe a spot at the Convention Fest but Ruffing declined because she didn't have the capacity to run a booth and the cafe itself. However, Ruffing made sure to register the cafe with the RNC vendor directory.\n\nA delegate from Pennsylvania called Ruffing to place an order of 150 box lunches, which she said was a \"dream\" for her business. But, the delegate then said that, if 600 East Cafe isn't part of Convention Fest, it can't cater lunch inside the perimeter.\n\nRuffing said she had no idea of this rule when she declined the position at Convention Fest.\n\n\"It's kind of still vague, but we were never really told (the rules),\" she said. \"Yesterday, I was feeling a little bummed because now I can't do catering and there's no people on this side of town.\"\n\nAdam Siegel, the owner of Lupi & Iris, 777 N. Van Buren St., also said communication from the Host Committee has been \"not great.\"\n\nIn 2023, Siegel said the Host Committee led them to have high expectations for RNC business.\n\n\"We thought we were gonna see people booking our private party rooms. We thought that we were going to see elevated business numbers because of us being very close proximity to Fiserv but outside of the security zone (with) plenty of parking above us,\" he said.\n\nThat has not been the case. If Monday's trend continues, Siegel said Lupi and Iris could be down well over 50 percent during the convention.\n\n\"I think that there's a few companies out there that are getting the majority of the business and they have a stronger affiliation maybe with Visit Milwaukee and the Host Committee, from what we hear,\" Siegel said.\n\nAt Andiamo Coffee and Tea, which is next to Lupi & Iris, manager Joshua Huff said traffic has mostly been tenants who live in the apartment building above the coffee shop.\n\nAs Andiamo is situated near the Northwestern Mutual and U.S. Bank offices, Huff said most of its regulars are commuters. This week, those regulars are \"gone.\"\n\n(2:50 p.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nHistoric Third Ward business activity lighter than usual\n\nBusiness activity in the Historic Third Ward has been lighter than usual this week.\n\n\"It's very quiet. And this neighborhood is very rarely quiet,\" said Karen Bell, owner of Bavette La Boucherie, a restaurant and butcher shop at 217 N. Broadway.\n\nThat includes a Tuesday lunch business that was about 25% of a normal weekday lunch, she said.\n\nAlso seeing slower than normal traffic this week is The Wicked Hop tavern and restaurant, 345 N. Broadway, said morning manager Lily Nieves.\n\nIt's been quieter than usual at Pink Moon Bay, a woman's clothing boutique at 317 N. Broadway, said Callie Mangan, assistant manager.\n\nBut the store got a bit of a bump Monday from convention attendees buying sun dresses — an apparent reaction to that day's 90-degree temperatures, Mangan said.\n\nAlso, the new Ben & Jerry's Scoop Shop, which had its first full day Monday, is doing a great business, much of its from neighborhood residents, said co-owner Tricia Rasmussen. It's at 203 N. Broadway.\n\nBut perhaps the Third Ward's best bellwether is The Milwaukee Public Market, 400 N. Water St., home to around 20 restaurants, taverns and shops.\n\nThe market had less business than usual Monday, said Paul Schwartz, executive director.\n\nHe attributed that in part to the market's proximity to security checkpoints for motorists heading west across the nearby Milwaukee River to the RNC, which tied up traffic. Tuesday has seen an uptick in business, Schwartz said.\n\nAnother factor that could be slowing down Third Ward activity: several parking spots in the 200 block of North Broadway were blocked off Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThat was apparently tied to security concerns centering on a private event scheduled for Tuesday night at The Kimpton Journeyman Hotel, at East Chicago Street and North Broadway, neighborhood business owners said.\n\n(2:40 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nAt an empty protest zone, push-up competitions to pass the time\n\nThe Haymarket Square demonstration zone a couple blocks away from Fiserv Forum remained quiet Tuesday.Two speakers spoke to an audience of about 13 event staffers and a few reporters until about 11:35 a.m. Other speakers had booked slots but hadn't shown up since then, with bookings slated until 6 p.m., according to one staffer.To pass the time, some event staffers began some push-up competitions.\n\n(2:35 p.m.)\n\n— Jolan Kruse and Piet Levy\n\nNBC News' Kristen Welker on being in Milwaukee: 'We are honored to be here'\n\nFor Kristen Welker, moderator of \"Meet the Press\" on NBC News, what's stuck out most about Milwaukee is how \"every single person who I encountered feels really proud\" to live in a swing state that's hosting a major political event.\n\n\"We are honored to be here,\" Welker told the Journal Sentinel in an interview at Good City Brewing, where NBC News has set up operations for the week. \"You can feel the responsibility and the weight that the people here in Milwaukee feel about hosting this convention. And in talking to people, people are buzzing about this race.\"\n\nWelker called Wisconsin \"ground zero\" for who wins the election. After winning the state in 2016 and losing it to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump \"wants to win it back. That's why he's here.\"\n\n\"He is making a statement that these voters, that Wisconsin matters to the Republican Party,\" Welker said. \"I think you are going to see both candidates make an incredibly forceful play to try to win over the voters here in Wisconsin.\"\n\n(2:10 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nHot dog vendors move to Red Arrow Park, have message for new Milwaukee visitors\n\nOn a typical weekday in Milwaukee, Jay Brown and Ireland Jones set up their mobile hot dog stand, IJ’s Quick Eats, on Third and Wells streets.\n\nRoadblocks and the RNC perimeter had kept them from getting to their normal spot, Jones said, so they set up shop on the southeast corner of Red Arrow Park.\n\n“This was the only spot,” he said, adding that an individual with the RNC welcomed the duo to sell their hotdogs, brats and chips there for the afternoon.\n\nThe traffic and parking challenges are “inconvenient,” Jones said, but he’s hopeful for business.\n\nJones and Brown said they’ll serve hot dogs and brats until 6 or 7 p.m. Tuesday and open back up Wednesday.\n\nAs Jones and Brown attended to a customer, chants on a loudspeaker from about 10 individuals holding signs with anti-LGBTQ+ messages stood on the roof above the coffee shop that looks over the park.\n\nOtherwise, Tuesday afternoon at the park was quiet in contrast to the hundreds of protestors who gathered there Monday.\n\nJones had a message for anyone visiting Milwaukee for the first time.\n\n“It’s a safe place to visit,” he said. “No matter what you see on the news, no matter what you hear, you just got to come here and enjoy (the) city for yourself.\n\n“I hope everybody who comes here from out of town, you have a great experience. And get some food.\"\n\n(2:05 p.m.)\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Caitlin Looby and La Risa Lynch\n\nMost of this morning's protest action was at the hard perimeter entrance near the Baird Center\n\nThe designated protest zones remained quiet throughout much of Tuesday morning and early afternoon. Instead, small groups of protestors have congregated outside the entrance areas to the hard security area.\n\nFor example, about 10 protestors were outside the entrance near the Baird Center near Wisconsin Avenue and Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the early afternoon. Many said they wanted to be near the action and felt like their voices would be better heard there.\n\nSean Keefe, an evangelist from North Carolina, said he was there because the protest zones and other entrance points were \"dead.\"\n\n\"It's a battle for ideas,\" Keefe said. \"So, we're just going where the people are.\"\n\n(2 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby and Bridget Fogarty\n\n3rd St. Market Hall vendors: 'None of us really made money yesterday'\n\nRNC week is off to a slow start for the vendors at 3rd St. Market Hall, 275 W. Wisconsin Ave. Most stalls struggled to reach their normal sale numbers Monday, despite expecting a rush of visitors from Fiserv Forum.\n\nBusiness owners were told by market hall managers to expect 1,200 to 1,300 customers. Instead, there were barely 300 people, said Ken Hughes of DawgCity Hot Dog.\n\nThe business owners said RNC event-goers were given pre-purchased gift cards that can be used at any stall. How each stall will be compensated for these gift-card purchases remain unclear for stall owners. Many of them are asking: What happens when these gift-card users don’t show up?\n\nThe huge difference in the expected and actual number of customers have already led to monetary loss. Hughes said he had hired extra hands in preparation for the RNC; Monday, he had to send two of the workers home.\n\nHughes said he saw stall owners handing out leftover food for free Monday.\n\nAccording to Edgar Aispuro, owner of Criollo, hall managers misjudged not only the size of the crowd but the time of its arrival.\n\n“First, they told us the food should’ve been ready at 1, so we were ready at 1. Nobody showed up,” Aispuro said. “They were like, ‘Oh, it’s gonna be 5:30.’ Still, nobody showed up. We ended up being open to 10. Still, nobody showed up.”\n\nAispuro said he hopes business will pick up. In the first few hours Tuesday, the store has made more profit than Monday.\n\n(1:45 p.m.)\n\n— Jane Park\n\nFBI, DHS warn of retaliatory attacks from extremists after assassination attempt on Trump\n\nIn a joint bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies across the country Monday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned that extremist individuals or groups may instigate “follow-on or retaliatory” attacks related to the 2024 presidential election over the next several months.\n\nThe warning was issued on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and in the wake of a shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania that left one attendee and the gunman dead, and two others critically injured. The shooting is being investigated as an assassination attempt against former Trump, who was wounded at the rally.\n\nWhile the warning was issued Monday, there's no clear connection to Milwaukee or the RNC.\n\nRead more\n\n(1:40 p.m.)\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY\n\nTuesday night speaker schedule released, includes Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde\n\nThe RNC has released its Tuesday night speaker list and schedule.\n\nEric Hovde, who is running for U.S. Senate against Democratic U.S. Sen.

But the restaurants are seeing an influx of new customers visiting for the RNC.\n\n“It’s not going to be a big moneymaking week but it’s going to be steady,” Cubanitas owner Marta Bianchini said.\n\nThe Cuban restaurant is extending its hours during the RNC, with a breakfast menu as well as a limited late-night menu.\n\nBrunch It Up’s sales goal for Monday was $1,800, said Allison Moseley, general manager. It finished the day with less than $1,000 in revenue.\n\n“Sales were a little slower than usual,” she said.\n\nBoth Moseley and Bianchini lamented the lack of street parking.\n\nThe block’s metered parking spaces are temporarily closed, with Milwaukee Street serving as a busy bus corridor for RNC attendees.\n\nAlso, the block is just west of the Pfister Hotel, where Trump is staying. That means heavy security and nearby street closures.\n\n(12:55 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\n85% of scheduled speakers in south protest zone didn't show up Monday\n\nAs Day 2 of the RNC started Tuesday — a day with weather much more forgiving than Monday’s extreme heat — one of two designated protest zones at Zeidler Union Square was quiet.\n\nAbout a dozen event safety staffers stood in the park.\n\nGroups are signed up to speak Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. So far, three groups that signed up to speak in the protest zone haven’t show up, according to the safety staff.\n\nStaff members also said that about 85% of Monday‘s speakers who signed up to talk at Zeidler Union Square didn’t show.\n\nFive men who said they’re with the group Official Street Preachers came to the park to speak but were turned away by event staff since they weren’t signed up to protest. The street preachers wore shirts with messaging against abortion, queer relationships and Bible verses.\n\n“Our plan was to preach but there’s no one to preach to,” said Rich Penkoski of Stillwater, Oklahoma.\n\nPenkoski has faced legal action in Oklahoma over inflammatory and threatening online posts about a gay couple, the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise reported.\n\nThe safety staff members said they expect it'll be even quieter Tuesday than Monday.\n\n(12:50 p.m.)\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, La Risa Lynch and Caitlin Looby\n\nTwo east side restaurants among businesses closed during convention\n\nSome east side downtown businesses are closed for the RNC.\n\nThey include two eateries in the lower level of an office building at 770 N. Jefferson St.: Shah Jee, a Pakistani restaurant, and Midwest Sad, which includes breakfast items and desserts on its menu.\n\nLast week, Midwest SAD owner Sam Sandrin told the Journal Sentinel that she was worried about how her still-new business would do during the RNC.\n\nShe had put out a call on the Milwaukee subreddit to encourage people to try their best to support local restaurants and small businesses during the convention.\n\n(12:45 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nDissenting voices engage more closely than ever at RNC security perimeter\n\nStanding on the same street corner near the 3rd Street Market Hall, protesters engage in discourse, face-to-face. Their long conversations occasionally attract the attention of other passerby, who stop to listen or take photos.\n\nIn addition to protesting in large groups Monday, individuals such as Nadine Seiler are deciding to stand alone or in pairs to protest near the perimeter. Some hold banners that declare “JESUS 2024: The Only Hope.” Others hold signs that read, “A World Without Fascism Is Possible.”\n\nAccording to Seiler, whose sign says, “A Racist Rapist Seditionist Frauder & Felon Walks into his Convention,” protesting alone can be a vulnerable experience, particularly as a Black woman. Earlier Tuesday, a passing man responded to her chants of “Trump’s a loser!” and slapped her finger.\n\nDespite that, she said she'll continue protesting Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n(12:30 p.m.)\n\n— Jane Park\n\nU.S. Coast Guard establishes maritime security zone on Milwaukee River\n\nThrough Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard will be monitoring security on the Milwaukee River from Cherry Street to Michigan Street.\n\nNo commercial or recreational vessel traffic will be permitted along the stretch of the river, called \"Maritime Zone 3,\" although privately owned vessels docked at their registered locations may move along the river — as long as their boats don't require road bridges to be raised. Road bridges will remain in the closed position for the week.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel first reported in February that the Milwaukee River would likely close down for the RNC.\n\nIn May, members of the U.S. Coast Guard received RNC maritime security training on Lake Michigan. It was part of a comprehensive security training that involved agencies including the Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Customs & Border Protection.\n\nAll privately owned vessels moving within the maritime security zone are subject to screening before re-entry. Docked vessels can remain stationary.\n\n(12:25 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nWisconsin delegate Eric Toney said political rhetoric has been toned down for convention\n\nEric Toney, the Fond du Lac County district attorney and a Wisconsin RNC delegate, said that, after Saturday's assassination attempt, there's been a marked shift in how people are talking at the convention.\n\n\"The rhetoric we're seeing appears to be changing and being toned down from some of the speeches that we saw last night, and it seems like that's probably going to continue throughout,\" he said. \"I think President Trump has an incredible opportunity as a leader to continue to help change the tone and make sure we're dialed in on the issues, because that's what we're seeing voters really care about.\"\n\nToney, who spoke to reporters on the Wisconsin Media Row, said people have been so siloed when it comes to political parties in recent years, important conversations about how to change things haven't been happening.\n\n\"We might not agree, but we need to have those discussions, because that's what makes America so wonderful, that we can express those views,\" he said. \"I think we have to be more open to that moving forward because we can't continue to see this political violence.\"\n\nOn the floor of the convention, Toney said, things have been a bit hectic for delegates, with long hours and plenty of heat outside. But getting to see former Trump was a great experience Monday night, even if he didn't speak to the crowd.\n\n\"You could just feel the energy in the room, and what really felt like one of those moments in history,\" he said.\n\n(12:20 p.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n'Why am I the only one here?' Protest zone in Haymarket Square empty Tuesday morning\n\nHaymarket Square in the north protest zone was largely empty around 11 a.m. Monday, with one speaker, 82-year-old Florida resident Bob Kunst of Shalom International, monologuing on a microphone to a couple of reporters and about 13 event staffers, including one staffer sitting on a gray barricade, nodding off.\n\n“Why am I the only one here?” asked Kunst, sitting and wearing a baseball cap and shirt in support of Israel.\n\nA registered Democrat, Kunst largely shared criticisms of President Joe Biden’s policies and the mainstream media, and called for more grassroots protest movements to gather and voice their concerns.\n\n“If we don’t fight for our liberty, we’re not going to make it,” he said.\n\nHe was followed after about 25 minutes by Lisa Bingenheimer, a speaker from local volunteer group Wisconsin 2A Team, which supports candidates who support the Second Amendment.\n\nBingenheimer said she was demonstrating Tuesday to promote freedom from government involvement, thanking the “nine people” within earshot who heard her speak for about 10 minutes, including her husband off to the side, who offered a round of applause.\n\nBy noon, the speakers were gone, leaving some staffers sitting around an empty stage.\n\n(12:15 p.m.)\n\n— Jolan Kruse and Piet Levy\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley says Day 1 of RNC was a great learning experience\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Day 1 of the RNC went smoothly and has been a great learning experience for the county, as well as an economic boost.\n\n\"I'm glad that so far all the vendors who are organizing the convention and convention-goers are enjoying themselves,\" he said. \"I know that traffic has been a little bit crazy for many of our residential folks and folks coming in to volunteer, but it's been a great opportunity to showcase and spotlight Milwaukee.\"\n\nCrowley said that, as a Democrat, he's been listening to what Republicans have to say.\n\n\"It gives me an opportunity to hear the message and what they're going to be bringing to the table as it relates to policies,\" he said. \"I want to see what that stark contrast looks like moving forward, because I truly believe that Democrats not only have a vision to share, but we have a story to tell.\"\n\nHe also offered some advice to first-time visitors to Milwaukee.\n\n\"Well, first and foremost, you have to go to a beer garden. ... You have to go down and visit Bradford Beach,\" he said. \"I know everyone knows us for our cheese curds and beer, but I think we're a pretty big foodie community and we have restaurants all over the city, in the county that everyone should absolutely go out to.\"\n\n(11:55 a.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nJournal Sentinel's Kristin Brey and JR Radcliffe talk about what happened, what's ahead at RNC\n\nVance photographed in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday morning\n\nVance was photographed walking through downtown Milwaukee near Water Street and Wisconsin Avenue on Tuesday morning with his family.\n\n(11:20 a.m.)\n\n— Alex Groth\n\nPro-Biden infrastructure signs dot RNC perimeter\n\nIt's an almost subtle sign against the more flashy red, white and blue in downtown Milwaukee, but it certainly stands out: \"Project Funded by President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\"\n\nThe sign was sponsored by the City of Milwaukee, the U.S. Department of Transportation and Investing in America, the latter of which is a White House agenda that aims to mobilize \"historic levels of private sector investments in the United States,\" according to the White House.\n\nAs of March, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has put $6.6 billion funds in Wisconsin, with more than 510 specific projects identified for funding, according to a White House press release.\n\nMilwaukee received about $85 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation and $2.5 million from the Environmental Protection Agency. A portion of that funding has gone into the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport Project, which aims to replace obsolete flat roof areas on airport buildings, making the buildings more resilient to weather and energy efficient.\n\nThe lion's share of the Department of Transportation's funding, at $80 million, will go to replacing the existing Interstate 39, 90 and 94 Wisconsin River bridge with two new bridge spans to improve the flow of traffic. Although this funding was awarded to Columbia County, north of Dane County, the route links Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago, serving as a key connector for these cities.\n\nThe Biden administration put another $36 million toward Milwaukee's 6th Street Complete Streets Project, which will reconnect communities along the more than 2½ miles of the 6th Street corridor.\n\nAccording to a White House fact sheet from March, the project provides wider sidewalks for children walking to school, safe bike lanes for residents and visitors, dedicated bus lines for faster transit, new trees and green infrastructure to prevent sewage run-off into the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan.\n\n(10:40 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nRNC brings some patriotic fashion choices\n\nOutside the Hyatt Regency hotel, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave., on Tuesday morning, Jay Kremmerer posed for a photo. He said his wife dressed him and he liked “the spirit of it.”\n\nNearby, Duane Schwingel said he was dressed by the “spirit of Uncle Sam.”\n\nHe wore an ear bandage with the words “fight fight” on it. He said he wanted to sell bandages with that written on them, too.\n\n(10:30 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nEx-Gov Tommy Thompson praises image of Trump after assassination attempt\n\nFormer Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson likened a photo of former President Donald Trump raising his fist after an assassination attempt Saturday to the iconic 1945 photo of Marines hoisting an American flag on top of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, and said that image alone will win Trump the election.\n\n\"Nothing is going to derail the campaign,\" Thompson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on the floor of the RNC on Monday.\n\nRead more\n\n(10:20 a.m.)\n\n— Jessie Opoien\n\n8 new 'Dark Brandon' billboards emerge around Milwaukee area\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is ramping up its campaign, this time with \"Dark Brandon\" billboards, a riff on the popular MAGA phrase \"Let's Go Brandon!\"\n\nThe satirical persona, which depicts a grinning President Joe Biden with red beams shooting from his eyes — think Cyclops from X-Men — can be seen at eight locations across Milwaukee:\n\nNorth side of McKinley Blvd., 100 feet east of 7th Street, facing east\n\nEast side of Interstate 43, 215 feet south of North Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-94, 800 feet south of I-794, facing south\n\nSouth side of I-794, 250 feet east of 6th Street, facing west\n\nWest side of I-794, 50 feet south of Potter Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-43, 270 feet north of Juneau Avenue, facing north\n\nEast side of I-94, 0.3 miles north of National Avenue, facing north\n\nSouth side of I-94, 200 feet east of 20th Street, facing west\n\nThe billboards come out simultaneously to the DNC's first anti-Trump-Vance billboards since the former president announced his running mate Monday.\n\nThe Dark Brandon billboards play on some of the same hot-button issues as the Trump-Vance billboards: abortion, Social Security cuts, democracy and health care.\n\nAbhi Rahman, DNC deputy communications director, said in a press release Tuesday morning that Trump, Vance and MAGA Republicans \"kicked off their Project 2025 convention by highlighting unpopular and extreme policies that would rip fundamental rights away from women and leave working families behind.\"\n\nTrump has made a point of disavowing Project 2025, a presidential transition project with conservative policy proposals written by the DC-based think-tank Heritage Foundation. Trump has repeatedly said he knows nothing about the plan.\n\n\"The DNC is highlighting Joe Biden’s winning platform and policies that are delivering for the American people,\" Rahman said in the Tuesday press release. \"We’re making sure voters know it by bringing Dark Brandon to Milwaukee to outline a bold second term agenda that sharply contrasts with what Wisconsinites are seeing on the RNC stage this week — restoring Roe, lowering costs, protecting Social Security, and safeguarding our democracy.”\n\n(9:45 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nTeamsters president makes history at Monday night's session\n\nSean O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on Monday night said it was an “honor” to be the first president in the union’s history to address a Republican National Convention.\n\n“Today, the Teamsters are here to say we are not beholden to anyone or any party,” O’Brien said. “I don’t care about getting criticized. It’s an honor to be the first Teamster in our 121-year history to address the Republican National Convention.”\n\nO’Brien said he reached out to both the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention to speak. He thanked Trump for inviting him to speak at the convention. While he didn't offer an endorsement, O’Brien underscored that the union has supported GOP presidential candidates in the past, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:30 a.m.)\n\n— Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY\n\nLate night shows quip about Milwaukee, RNC\n\nLate night television took a few swipes at Milwaukee and more than a few at the RNC speakers Monday night.\n\nWisconsin and Milwaukee got the most airtime on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which dedicated a live monologue to the opening day of the RNC. Right away, Milwaukee and its nicknames got Colbert’s first jabs, after he kindly described it as a “beautiful” place.\n\n“Also known as Brew City, Beer City and ‘All of the other Cities are Worried about you’ City,” he said.\n\nColbert seemed to have genuine respect for some of the other names around the city, too, especially one in the RNC’s soft security zone.\n\n“If you’re in Milwaukee, and you can’t get into the convention, there is an official convention watch party at a local pub called — and this is true — Drink Wisconsibly,” he said. “Lovely, bravo. Truly one of the best state- and warning-label-themed bars in the country.”\n\nColbert also made fun of the state law that doesn’t allow for guns to be banned in the RNC’s soft zone, but things like tennis balls are banned. He also poked at U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s remarks on Wisconsin’s very kind people as a reason to not be concerned about safety.\n\n“Yes, Wisconsin only produces the nicest people like Tony Shalhoub, Chris Farley and Jeffrey Dahmer,” he said.\n\nThe last Wisconsin person to get teased was none other than Rev. James A. Roemke of Messiah Lutheran Church in Kenosha. Roemke gave his best impression of Trump, saying that everyone was “going to be so blessed” and waved his hands in a Trump-esque way.\n\n“Oh my lord. It is a miracle,\" Colbert said. \"Someone has a worse Trump impression than me.”\n\nRead more\n\n(9:15 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nDemocratic National Committee moves overnight to hit Trump-Vance ticket\n\nThe Democratic National Committee wasted no time responding to Trump selecting Vance as his running mate.\n\nSixteen billboards and a mobile billboard in the Milwaukee area sprouted overnight, in time for the RNC's second day. It's the first paid media campaign that takes shots at the Trump-Vance ticket.\n\nThe billboards strike a grim tone, veering on doomsday for democracy. The DNC took aim at the Trump-Vance stance on abortion, tax breaks for the wealthy and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEach billboard also references Project 2025, a proposed presidential transition project by the Heritage Foundation, a DC-based think tank. One billboard echoed the fear that Trump would use the election to transform the United States into a dictatorship: \"Dictator on 'Day One,'\" alluding to the nearly 900-page document.\n\nTrump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025.\n\nVance has taken a hardline stance on abortion, which he opposes even in cases of incest and rape. It's one of the key issues likely to dominate the campaign trail. When he ran for the Senate in 2022, his campaign website said simply \"Ban Abortion\" on the issues page. The DNC's billboard played up his two-word stance, with \"Ban Abortion, Punish Women.\"\n\nDespite his rags-to-riches story that his bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegies,\" encapsulates, the DNC billboard said a Trump-Vance ticket means \"Tax breaks for billionaires, higher costs for you,\" according to another billboard.\n\nThe other billboard says that a Trump-Vance ticket will destroy the Affordable Care Act and Social Security: \"Terminate the ACA, Gut Social Security.\"\n\n(9 a.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nMilwaukee mayor seeks to reassure businesses seeing less-than-normal traffic during RNC\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson on Tuesday sought to reassure local businesses that saw less traffic than normal on the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nRestaurants in the Third Ward reported normal or lower-than-normal diner levels Monday.\n\nJohnson said he heard announcements within Fiserv Forum that Trump would be making an appearance in the convention hall. Then, Johnson said, Trump’s appearance was repeatedly delayed, which he thought prompted people not to leave the area to avoid missing Trump’s first public appearance since an assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania.\n\nInstead of leaving the credentials-only “hard” perimeter, he thought convention attendees went to Convention Fest, a vendor fair at the RNC showcasing local Milwaukee businesses for RNC attendees.\n\nJohnson expected business outside the hard perimeter to pick up Tuesday.\n\n“From what I understand, that was probably more of an anomaly just because folks had to wait. They chose to wait,” Johnson said.\n\nHis comments were also political. Johnson, a Democrat and a vocal supporter of Biden’s re-election campaign, urged people to vote in November’s presidential election.\n\nHe was also critical of Trump and his choice of Vance to be his vice presidential running mate.\n\n“There are a lot of questions and certainly a lot of concern,” Johnson said. “We now have a Republican candidate on the vice presidential side without any executive experience and a Republican presidential candidate whose executive experience we’ve already endured over the course of a term.”\n\nJohnson called Trump's response to the COVID-19 \"botched\" and credited Biden's policies for helping turn around city crime during the pandemic.\n\nJohnson pointed to the pairing of local policies and the American Rescue Plan Act as helping Milwaukee abate crime that had spiked during the pandemic. Recent crime data shows that, halfway through 2024, crime is above 2019 levels but made improvements from prior years.\n\n\"Working with President Biden's administration and our policies around accountability and prevention, for the last two years, all under President Biden's leadership we've seen crime trend down year over year in Milwaukee,\" Johnson said. \"I don't think there's really much to touch in terms of public safety when you compare the policies.\"\n\n(8:15 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr and David Clarey\n\nMayor says three arrested Monday, protest goes smoothly\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said three people were arrested near the Republican National Convention on Monday but lauded it as a “peaceful” start to the week.\n\nOf the three arrests, one involved a repeat offender. That person attempted — for the second time — to climb a fence into a restricted area, Johnson said. A second arrest occurred when someone blocked traffic in the evening and didn't follow police orders to move.\n\nJohnson said the third arrest occurred at the end of the Coalition to March on the RNC demonstration. The person was arrested for disorderly conduct, the mayor said.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel previously reported that online video showed a man wearing a Chicago Bears shirt was seen in handcuffs following the parade. Authorities said the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at Red Arrow Park, at 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nOverall, Johnson said the march and day went peacefully, without major incident. No one was hurt and there wasn't significant property damage involved with the march.\n\n“By most important measures, things are going pretty well,” he said. “Overall, it was a calm day, it was a peaceful day.”\n\n(8 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nArtist, Trump fan will display 24K gold-plated MAGA hat at RNC\n\nThough plenty of MAGA hats are sure to be spotted at the convention, one is set to stand out.\n\nA 24K gold-plated bronze replica of the MAGA hat will be on display today through Thursday at the convention. Artist XVALA — a contemporary artist known for using controversial celebrity images and artifacts of the internet age in his work — will be showcasing the gold hat.\n\nIn a press release, XVALA said the hat aims to represent the legacy of Make America Great Again.\n\n\"Trump will usher in a new golden age for America. MAGA is the gold ticket to success for America,\" the release said.\n\nThe hat is a 3D-printed replica of a real MAGA hat, signed by Trump. On his website, XVALA wrote that the hat is intended as a response to Maurizio Cattelan's \"America,\" a fully functioning toilet made from 18-karat solid gold.\n\n\"XVALA's MAGA hat, while impractical for everyday use, remains technically functional as it is a 1:1 replica of the original,\" the website read. \"But unlike Cattelan, the hat exhorts us to make America great, not to disparage it as a waste receptacle.\"\n\nAfter the convention, the hat will be auctioned off at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday. The hat is listed for $15,000 on XVALA's website.\n\n(7:45 a.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nNew York artist, activist makes a virtual point\n\nNew York-based artist and political activist Norm Magnusson has created augmented reality art that shows historical markers on the plaza of Fiserv Forum with pointed statements.\n\nThe works aren't visible — they can only be seen through the Scavengar – easy AR mobile app.\n\nThe blue and gold markers include political messages about Project 2025 class inequality, former presidents’ roles and more.\n\nOne of the piece's messages reads: “On this site stood every single U.S. President since 1980. Each oversaw the continued redistribution of wealth from lower and middle classes to the richest 1%.”\n\nThe plaques are similar to others Magnusson made in the early 2000s and fit in the vein of his other work. On his artist website, he breaks down work critical of former President George W. Bush and his administration and other political topics.\n\nMagnusson’s work has appeared in The Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of the City of New York and others. He's known for his funism artwork, a style described as fun to look at and think about, while being intellectually engaging without being elitist.\n\nHe's from Illinois, according to a story on his work from The Villager, a New York publication.\n\n(7:30 a.m.)\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: Temperatures, humidity will start to fall after overnight showers\n\nAfter overnight rains, Monday's hot temperatures should cool off.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 82, according to the National Weather Service. Though the humidity shouldn't be as extreme as yesterday, it might still feel \"a touch muggy\" as a cold front continues to move through the area, meteorologist Andrew Quigley said.\n\nOvernight, Milwaukee received .17 inches of rain, with a thunder shower over downtown between 4:30 and 5 a.m.\n\nSouthern Wisconsin had more severe weather overnight, with reports of damaging winds and large hail along the state line with Illinois. The NWS has received reports of tree damage affiliated with straight-line winds.\n\nNo additional severe weather is forecasted for Tuesday, though Quigley said there's potential for an isolated shower in the afternoon.\n\nDrier and less humid air is expected for the rest of the RNC, with temperatures in the mid-70s from Wednesday to Friday.\n\n\"Improvement is on the way,\" Quigley said.\n\n(7:15 a.m.)\n\n— Kathryn Muchnick\n\nWhat time is the RNC?

But on the internet, it would soon take on a life of its own. No need to stock up on bananas after a port workers strike concluded. Country star Garth Brooks has denied sexual assault allegations.\n\n🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert, Daily Briefing author. 🦴🎤 Welcome to the \"scEras Tour!\"\n\n'No, this isn’t a public bus, this is a school bus'\n\nBelow is an excerpt from a USA TODAY report on what actually happened at a Southern California school bus stop when a woman met a group of people who had crossed the border.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 28, just as the sun sliced over the mountains east of San Diego, Guadalupe Dukes and her 6-year-old grandson, Gael, sat in their car, waiting for the school bus. Then a young woman tapped on the car window. In stilted English, the woman asked which way they should head to find a town. Dukes directed them, as best she could, toward the tiny hamlet of Dulzura, some six miles west.\n\nThen came a pivotal moment: Dukes warned the migrants to be careful on the busy road, saying “Watch out for the buses.” At that word: “bus,” the young woman’s eyes lit up. “Bus,” she urged her companions, who repeated the word to each other with hopeful recognition.\n\nAnd at that very instant, Gael’s yellow school bus appeared. Seeing the bus, the young woman raised a whistle to her lips and blew, sending a shriek across the steady hum of traffic. Suddenly, more migrants appeared from the bushes. But Dukes warned the group no, \"this is isn't a public bus\" and it was intended for students. Hearing this news, the group never got close to the vehicle, and they certainly never attempted to board, Dukes told USA TODAY.\n\nThis story started with a kernel of truth. But – much like other stories that have marked this election season – it included a mixture of immigration and possible danger, released into a country already wound tight over issues of border security. Keep reading USA TODAY's account to find out what happened next.\n\nUS port workers reach deal to end costly strike\n\nA union representing U.S. dock workers and port operators have reached a tentative deal on wages that will end a three-day strike that has shut down shipping on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast. The tentative agreement is for a wage hike of around 62% over six years. The deal ends the biggest work stoppage of its kind in nearly half a century.\n\nMore news to know now\n\nWhat's the weather today?

Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added. That’s “where we have been winning.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/22/sex-abuse-catholic-church-why-more-americans-leaving/3507437002/", "title": "Sex abuse in the Catholic Church: Why more Americans are leaving", "text": "YORK, Pa. – On Palm Sunday, Barbara Hoover exited Brougher Chapel with a palm frond in her left hand.\n\nThe 76-year-old retiree sized up the church in front of her and sighed, visibly upset. “I don’t know why I’m still here,” she said, throwing her hands up. “I don’t know why I still go. I guess the ritual.”\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, Norma Rodriguez, 51, hustled up the steps of St. Mary’s Cathedral of Immaculate Conception, eager to get a good seat before the service started.\n\nA lifelong Catholic, Rodriguez attends Mass weekly, praying for everyone she knows. She hasn’t been deterred by the sex abuse crisis that’s engulfed the Catholic Church for the better part of two decades. It’s not her place to pass judgment, Rodriguez said.\n\n“This whole thing, it makes me pray more,” she said. “It just makes me pray for humanity, makes me pray for forgiveness.”\n\nIn Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Sara and Nathan Hofflander brought their three young daughters to Palm Sunday Mass, then joined the bustle of people chatting and enjoying a hot meal during St. Lambert’s yearly parish dinner. Plates filled with turkey and potatoes. The parents corralled their girls – ages 5, 3 and 1 – and found a spot near a window.\n\nSara Hofflander, 32, grew up Catholic and Nathan Hofflander, 40, joined the church in 2011. The fallibility of clergy doesn’t faze him. “We are all broken in some way,” he said. “We’re not all perfect.”\n\nThe Catholic Church in the U.S. is at a crossroads. As millions of devout followers filled the pews this Easter season to celebrate the religion’s most important holiday, others hovered at the door, hungry for community and spiritual guidance but furious at the church’s handling of the decades-long sex abuse crisis that’s resulted in young children being raped and abused by priests who were often protected by their superiors.\n\nSeven months after a damning grand jury report in Pennsylvania revealed that 1,000 children had been abused at the hands of more than 300 priests, and as state attorneys general across the nation investigate the church, a Gallup poll published in March found that 37% of U.S. Catholics are considering leaving the church because of the sex abuse crisis and the church’s handling of it. That’s up significantly from 2002, when just 22% of Catholics said they were contemplating leaving their religion after The Boston Globe published an explosive series that initially exposed the abuse and subsequent cover-up.\n\nOn Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week, the USA TODAY Network sent 13 reporters out to parishes across the country to talk with dozens of Catholics about their faith and the scandal that has bankrupted churches after million dollar settlements, exposed thousands of accused priests and left unknown numbers of victims struggling to rebuild their childhoods, families and spiritual lives. Reporters visited white, black, Latino and Asian majority churches in cities and rural areas from California to New York, from Florida to Guam, as priests across the world spoke of repentance, forgiveness and, ultimately, new life.\n\nRead more:After Catholic Church sex abuse cover-ups, we in the pews must no longer simply pray & pay\n\nIn the Bible, Jesus’ crucifixion gives way to death and mourning. Three days later, resurrection comes, along with the hope of new beginnings. Many Catholics – most of whom were raised in the faith and can’t imagine celebrating major milestones without it – want the church to have a similar rebirth. But as church leaders, led by the pope in Rome, continually refuse total transparency and justice for victims, some wonder if that renewal will ever come.\n\nIn El Paso, Texas, Maria Pacheco normally watches Mass from home, when she tunes into a Spanish-language TV station. But on Palm Sunday, a friend offered her a ride to church. Pacheco attended the first Mass of the day at St. Paul the Apostle, a mostly Hispanic Catholic parish with services in English and Spanish.\n\nPacheco’s seen a lot in the news about the abuse crisis. She finds it abhorrent. The scandal hasn’t driven Pacheco, 76, away from church, but she does have doubts.\n\n“I think it has made me lose trust in priests in general,” she said in Spanish. “Sometimes I wonder, if I were to come and say confession, would he have committed worse things?”\n\nQuestioning the Catholic Church\n\nAcross the country in Nashville, Tennessee, as the 8:30 a.m. Palm Sunday Mass let out, well-dressed Catholics streamed out of the Cathedral of the Incarnation carrying palm fronds in their hands, some tied and braided to look like the Christian cross.\n\nMaria Michonski, a 24-year-old student who said the clergy sex abuse crisis has contributed to questions she has about the Catholic Church as an institution, was not among the faithful.\n\nA student at Vanderbilt's Divinity School, Michonski been trying to figure out for several years how her faith – which she learned as a child – fits into her adult life.\n\nMichonski grew up in the Nashville diocese, went through the city’s Catholic school system and studied theology as an undergraduate at Saint Louis University. She started to have a contentious relationship with the church five years ago when she came out as queer.\n\nFor a while, Michonski stopped practicing all together. Now she attends Mass sporadically, divided between her desire to help make the church better while wanting to distance herself from the sex abuse crisis. But she said she won't contribute financially.\n\n“I don’t tithe to the diocese, and that is intentional,” Michonski said. “Continuing to amass power and wealth inside a system that is so clearly broken feels very unconscionable to me.”\n\nMore on the Catholic Church's declining membership:The Catholic Church is worried about its future. Latino millennials may be the answer\n\nThe more stories she sees about clergy sex abuse, the angrier she gets. But she can’t walk away entirely.\n\n“On good days it feels like it’s possible to make some change in the church and on bad days it doesn’t,” she said. “And the bad days are often linked to these big news stories where you just see how deep the power, abuse and corruption lie in the church.”\n\n‘I felt spiritually abandoned’\n\nFor Maureen Roden, the pull of tradition wasn’t enough.\n\nRoden, who lives just outside of Washington, D.C., grew up in “your typical Irish Catholic family.” She and her three siblings were raised in the church, attending Mass regularly. When she married – her husband was raised Protestant – and started having children, she decided they’d be baptized Catholic, too.\n\nYears later, on the morning of Jan. 6, 2002, her two girls were dressed in their Sunday best and eating breakfast when Roden saw The Boston Globe’s story. Appalled, she told her husband they wouldn’t go to Mass that day. She hasn’t been back since.\n\nMore:David Hickton called the Catholic church organized crime. He wanted to save it.\n\n“This was my moral authority, this is who I went to for moral direction,” said Roden, now 53. “I felt so angry and so betrayed. Not only that there were pedophiles in the church, but that they knew about it and covered it up.\n\n“I could not bring my children to that church and say, ‘These are your leaders.’ I couldn’t put my money in the collection basket. I felt spiritually abandoned.”\n\nShe and her husband church-shopped for a few months, but everything felt off. Members of the Unitarian Church wearing sweats to Sunday service bewildered her. When she suggested they try a local Jewish synagogue, her husband gently asked if she was ready to give up her 63 Christmas albums.\n\nMore:45 states looking to pursue Catholic church for documents on abuse by priests, Pennsylvania attorney general says\n\nUltimately, they settled on a Presbyterian congregation, but it never felt quite right. Roden missed the format and tradition of Catholicism, a religion where anyone can attend Mass on any given day, anywhere in the world, and hear the same order, prayers and liturgy. She found comfort in that structure, just like she did with familiar Catholic hymns. Without them, she felt lost.\n\n“It didn’t stick,” she said sadly. “These weren’t my people.”\n\nDismayed to find out there’s no real breaking up with the Catholic church – “once you’re baptized, they consider you in forever,” she said – Roden spent the next 16 years disgusted by what Catholic leaders had done. Some of her anger, she thought, might have come from her previous work as a pediatric nurse: She understood the toll sexual abuse can have and knew recovery often takes many painful years.\n\nShe didn’t worry that in holding others accountable, she was trading away her shot at salvation. Instead, she thought often about the mantra, “What would Jesus do?” She knew he wouldn’t tolerate anyone hurting children.\n\n“As a society, why should we expect any less from the pope than we do from the principal at our children’s schools?” Roden said. “If a teacher sexually assaulted a child, that person would be fired immediately and the police would be called.”\n\nRoden’s not sure if she’ll ever be able to re-join the religion she grew up loving. She wonders sometimes what would need to happen for her to attend another Mass, or to put money in the collection plate. Maybe she could get there, she said – but not before major change.\n\nHolding strong to faith\n\nIn other parts of the country, many Catholics acknowledged their unwavering beliefs as well as the hurt their spiritual leaders have caused.\n\nIn the U.S. territory of Guam, Johnny Villagomez lost trust in the Catholic priests who were named multiple times in Guam’s clergy sex abuse revelations since 2016. But he and his wife, Linda, have not lost faith in God or the church.\n\n“Who else is going to take care of the church if not us, the believers?” said Villagomez, 75, a retired wildlife conservation officer.\n\nThat same sentiment was expressed in Atlanta, where on a rainy Palm Sunday, parishioners filed into the sanctuary at Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church collecting palm leaves from a wooden table set up in the lobby area. Next to the leaves, a white basket overflowed with packets of the morning’s scripture reading: Luke 23:1-49. That passage details Jesus’ crucifixion, including when Jesus cries out to God, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”\n\nAttendance at this majority black church rises each Easter holiday season, said the Rev. Desmond Drummer. Allegations of widespread sex abuse throughout the Catholic Church haven’t changed that.\n\n“Sometimes we need to remind folks … you are innocent, you are a beloved child of God,” Drummer told his congregation during the service.\n\nTo Richard Jones, who has attended Most Blessed Sacrament for the past 16 years, the abuse crisis signals a need for greater engagement, not abandonment.\n\n“I have lots of concerns, and that’s why I stay involved,” said Jones, 79, a retired consultant. “I’m not totally enamored with where we are. But I’m not so disassociated that I’m ready to walk away.”\n\nMore:Catholic Church: Jesuits name priests with 'established accusations' of child sex abuse\n\nYounger members feel that way, too.\n\nIn Tempe, Arizona, about 60 people gathered at the All Saints Catholic Newman Center on the Arizona State University campus. One of the congregants was 29-year-old registered nurse Angela Jungbluth, who has been Catholic since birth. The sex abuse scandal “shocked” her, but Jungbluth said she never questioned her commitment to the Catholic faith because of it.\n\n“I think the truth runs deeper than the sins of really evil men,” she said. “My faith is not held together because people are good, it’s more because God is good.”\n\nOne man showed up to Mass in an ASU tank top, gym shorts and sandals while two women arrived wearing traditional Catholic veils covering their heads. The Mass began with the vague smell of frankincense and a processional into the church, where all members of the congregation held palm branches in honor of Jesus' triumphant arrival to Jerusalem.\n\nIn South Dakota, Mary Glenski claimed the problems with the church – specifically with the Sioux Falls diocese – are in the past. The problems belonged to \"that time period,” she said, adding that in regard to the recent allegations, \"in some cases, it's been so long ago that people that come with accusations may or may not have accurate memories.”\n\nDespite reports of abuse and the release of names by South Dakota’s two dioceses last month, the 88-year-old retired teacher and South Dakota lawmaker said she won’t be revoking her membership or her financial support.\n\nStill, the constant stream of new accusations is challenging for the survivors of clergy abuse. The ongoing crisis is a reminder not only of their own suffering, but of the church’s failure to protect them.\n\nMichael Vanderburgh, a father of four in Dayton, Ohio, struggled for years to reconcile the abuse he endured at the hands of a priest with his decision to remain a Catholic. He ultimately chose to separate the religion he loved from the church leaders who betrayed him.\n\n“The church is not about the humanity of its individual actors,” said Vanderburgh, 47. “It’s focused on God. It’s not focused on the individuals who make it up.”\n\nOver time, Vanderburgh did more than forgive the church. He went to work for it. A few years ago, he led the largest-ever fundraising campaign at the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, bringing in more than $100 million. He’s now executive director of another Catholic charity, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, in Dayton.\n\nRead more the Catholic Church sex abuse crisis:Were U.S. nuns abused by priests? Catholic women respond to Pope Francis' remarks on abuse\n\nWhile Vanderburgh said he thinks the church has made strides toward strong safeguards for children, he doesn’t mind that church leaders are taking a beating for their past failures. Catholics, especially abuse survivors, deserve a full accounting, he said.\n\n“There is still some reckoning to do with the past,” he said.\n\nChurch leaders acknowledge hurt, promise change\n\nIn Southern California, church members said leaders know they can’t hide from the abuse, or from talking about it.\n\nAt St. Bridget Chinese Catholic Church in central Los Angeles, about 70 people gathered for the English Mass following a service in Cantonese.\n\nPotted palm plants wrapped with purple tissue paper decorated altars inside. Outside, elderly members socialized in Cantonese, ate oranges and read community newspapers. Inside the church’s foyer, pamphlets on preventing child abuse sat on a table. During Mass, one of the group prayers highlighted National Child Abuse Protection Month, calling for renewed commitment to supporting children.\n\n“They probably provide a lot more training than we ever feel like we needed to make sure it doesn’t happen,” said Peter Chan, 44, a sales manager and lifelong Catholic.\n\nIn Nashville, the Rev. Edward Steiner, pastor of the Cathedral of the Incarnation, tries to be frank with his congregation.\n\n\"A person that I’ve kind of got a great rapport with, but who's also very blunt and direct, just simply said, 'Father, I don’t know that I can take anymore. Could you please give me a reason to be a Catholic?' \" Steiner said.\n\nSince the most recent wave of allegations, Steiner said he’s heard from Catholics who are victims of abuse, but not at the hands of the church. Hearing about the church scandal often triggers past trauma and brings with it a flood of questions.\n\nCatholics, Steiner says, are not looking for reasons to leave, but for reasons to stay.\n\nParishioners aren’t the only ones searching for answers. Future leaders are, too.\n\nAs Rodriguez walked inside St. Mary’s Cathedral in Portland, Saul Medina handed her his navy blazer, and asked her to save him a spot.\n\nBorn in Guadalajara, Mexico, Medina felt a call to the priesthood roughly 10 years ago, shortly after he started a career in finance.

For the name of his new store, Coulombe landed on Trader Joe’s to evoke exotic images of the South Seas. The name was inspired by Trader Vic’s, a popular Tiki Bar restaurant started in California.\n\nJoe Coulombe the, founder of Trader Joe's, in 1986. John Blackmer/Orange County Register/Getty Images\n\nOne marketing expert thought it was a terrible name – “Trader” was “something associated with selling defective horse flesh,” Coulombe said in his memoir, “Becoming Trader Joe,” published in 2021, a year after he died at age 89.\n\nBut it stuck, and the first Trader Joe’s opened in Pasadena, California, in 1967. The location was ideal for his new target customer, surrounded by college campuses, a hospital and big engineering firms.\n\n“He was a grocery outsider who was able to see things differently,” said Benjamin Lorr, author of “The Secret Life of Groceries: The Dark Miracle of the American Supermarket.” “He wanted to tap into this idea that food was exploration, that food was travel and adventure.”\n\nNautical theme\n\nThe first Trader Joe’s store had a nautical theme with marine artifacts including a ship’s bell, fish netting and half of a rowboat. The check out counter was an island with a roof. Employees wore Polynesian shirts and Bermuda shorts. The manager was called captain and the assistant was first mate. And lilting Hawaiian music played over the loudspeakers.\n\nBut the merchandise looked nothing like what you’d find at a Trader Joe’s today.\n\nThe original store had a typical convenience shop assortment of groceries, along with discounted magazines, books, socks and hosiery, records and photo finishing. The big draw, however, was the alcohol selection.\n\nThe original Trader Joe's in Pasadena, California. It opened in 1967. Chris Pizzello/AP/FILE\n\nCalifornia had Fair Trade laws on alcohol, so manufacturers set minimum prices and it was illegal to go below them. Since Coulombe couldn’t compete by offering low prices, he recognized he had to offer a wide variety to stand out.\n\nThe first Trader Joe’s boasted of having the world’s largest assortment of alcohol – 100 brands of Scotch, 50 brands of bourbon and gin and 14 types of tequila.\n\nCoulombe eventually found a loophole in California’s Fair Trade laws that allowed his shop to import high-end French wine and sell it for lower prices than competitors, helping him reach wine connoisseurs. (It would not be until years later that Trader Joe’s released its famous $1.99 Charles Shaw wine, known as “Two-Buck Chuck.”)\n\nHealth craze\n\nBy the early 1970s, Coulombe seized on the growing health food movement, believing it would appeal to the same type of customers who also happened to be wine connoisseurs.\n\n“His ideas on marketing groceries came from his marketing of wine,” Benjamin Lorr said.\n\nTrader Joe’s first private-label product was granola, and then it started adding fresh squeezed orange juice, vitamins, nuts and dried foods and cheese. At one point, Trader Joe’s was the largest US importer of brie.\n\nCoulombe became immersed in the health food culture in Berkeley and San Francisco.\n\n“I hired a young hippie woman out of the University of California at Santa Cruz to teach us the lingo,” he said.\n\nBrandenburg Brownies and Sir Issac Newtons\n\nIn 1977, Coulombe remade Trader Joe’s again – setting it on a path that would be more familiar to today’s customers.\n\nIn response to the end of Fair Trade laws on alcohol in California and other price controls, Trader Joe’s needed new ways to grow profit and stay competitive. It eliminated most household basics and cleaning essentials and focused on food. It also slashed the number of items it carried and moved to largely selling private-label items.\n\n“As we evolved Trader Joe’s, its greatest departure from the norm wasn’t its size or its decor,” Coulombe said. “It was our commitment to product knowledge, something which was totally foreign to the mass-merchant culture, and our turning our backs to branded merchandise.”\n\nThe company even positioned its private-label names and branding to connect with well-educated shoppers – Brandenburg Brownies and Sir Issac Newtons, for example – Coulombe said.\n\nCreating strong private-label offerings to rival national brands would be one of his legacies in the supermarket industry, said Lorr. “That changed the balance of the grocery industry. Suddenly, grocers are empowered in a way they weren’t.”\n\nBut Coulombe resisted opening up dozens of new stores.\n\nTrader Joe's has more than 500 stores across the United States today. Nati Harnik/AP\n\nThe handful of stores Coulombe did open were in Southern California, which fit the demographic profile he was seeking – teachers, musicians, journalists and other professionals.\n\nIn 1979, Coulombe sold Trader Joe’s to the family of Theo Albrecht, then the owner of the Aldi grocery chain in Europe. (Aldi in the United States is separately owned by the family of Theo Albrecht’s brother Karl.)\n\nAldi executives would travel from Germany to visit Trader Joe’s about once a year, but they took a hands-off approach to overseeing the growing chain.\n\nBy the time Coulombe stepped down as chief executive in 1988, Trader Joe’s had 27 California stores and an estimated $150 million in sales.\n\nIt would be his successor as chief executive, John Shields, a former fraternity brother at Stanford, who led Trader Joe’s out of California and turned it into a national chain. In 1996, Trader Joe’s opened its first two stores on the East Coast, both in Boston suburbs.\n\nBy 2020, Trader Joe’s had more than 530 stores and an estimated $16.5 billion in sales, according to the latest data available from Supermarket News.\n\n“My successors at Trader Joe’s have taken a 30-store chain nationwide with remarkable adherence to the basic concepts we started out with,” Coulombe said in 2010.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/business/starbucks-buyback-program/index.html", "title": "Howard Schultz suspends Starbucks' share buyback program | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nHoward Schultz’s first act on his return as Starbucks CEO is to pause the company’s share buyback program.\n\n“Starting immediately, we are suspending our share repurchasing program,” Schultz wrote in an open letter to Starbucks employees, customers and others which was published early Monday. “This decision will allow us to invest more into our people and our stores — the only way to create long-term value for all stakeholders.”\n\nMonday marks Schultz’s first day as interim CEO, and his third stint as chief executive of the company.

Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nHe’s also trying to dissuade employees from unionizing.\n\nSince December, a number of Starbucks (SBUX) stores have unionized against the company’s wishes, and several more are considering the option.\n\nSchultz was trying to build support for the company even before he rejoined as interim CEO. In November, he spoke directly to Buffalo-area employees about the company’s merits. He also penned a letter posted to the company’s website touting the importance of a “direct and shared relationship” with workers.\n\nThe decision to stop buying back shares may also be designed to build support for the company’s management.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, on March 16, the company said that it had reinstated its buyback program. It said at the time that over the next three fiscal years, it was planning to return $20 billion to shareholders. As of Monday, the program has been suspended.\n\nBuyback programs are popular among investors because they lower the total number of outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share. But not everyone is a fan. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called Starbucks out following the announcement, saying “If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends … it can afford a unionized workforce.”\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson characterized the decision to suspend the buyback program as “Starbucks’ agenda, and only Starbucks’ agenda.”\n\nStarbucks, evolved\n\nSchultz is back at the helm at a pivotal moment for Starbucks.\n\nNot only is the unionization drive picking up steam, but the company is up against a number of other challenges.\n\nStarbucks “is facing new realities in a changed world,” Schultz wrote.

Schultz said that he hopes for “an evolution of our company.”\n\nTo that end, he plans to spend time with employees to hear their thoughts.\n\n“I will be traveling … to connect with partners in our stores and manufacturing plants around the world to understand your thinking and ideas about how to build this next Starbucks,” he wrote.\n\nSchultz is holding an open forum for employees on Monday, according to the company spokesperson, during which he will address some of the macroeconomic issues affecting the company.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner Poppy Harlow", "Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Poppy Harlow"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/business-food/burger-king-pride-whopper/index.html", "title": "Burger King has a 'Pride Whopper' with 'two equal buns' | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nBurger King’s new hamburger to celebrate Pride Month has caused quite the stir on social media.\n\nThe fast-food giant’s Austrian stores will be serving a “Pride Whopper” with “two equal buns” — either two top buns or two bottom buns — until June 20 to promote “equal love and equal rights,” the company said in an Instagram post last week.\n\nBurger King said in the post that the new burger’s “little twist” is “meant to put a smile on our faces and to remind us to treat each other with respect and peace.”\n\nBurger King/Instagram\n\nSome users on social media found the new burger funny, while others criticized the company, arguing that the joke was offensive and an example of “rainbow washing” — the practice of companies showing surface-level support for LGBTQ+ identifying people without any specific action that could improve their lives.\n\n“Burger King Austria made a Pride burger that’s either two tops or two bottoms… what in straight hell?” Jarett Wieselman, a manager at Netflix, said in a Friday tweet.\n\nBut an Instagram user, who goes by the name unacornium, saw the funny side.\n\n“As a gay person, this is the funniest thing I have ever seen and I don’t think I’ll ever stop laughing,” unacornium said on Monday.\n\nIt is not clear whether Burger King plans to donate any money made from the Pride Whopper to LGBTQ+ organizations.

They tell of being abused by staff, of fearing punishment at all hours. They describe living in filth.\n\nThey call themselves survivors.\n\nOne former staffer we spoke to at Trails Carolina detailed why he thought his training as well as the treatment teens received at the program was entirely insufficient.\n\nHere’s the whole story:\n\nThe bathroom consisted of a tarp tied between two trees.\n\nWhen Katelyn Haruko Schmisseur used it, she made eye contact with a staff member. She squatted, they stared. A requirement of her wilderness therapy program, they told her.\n\nBecause of her eating disorder, a staff member was with her at all times almost the entire length of her stay in the Utah desert.\n\nA bucket lined with a biohazard bag acted as a receptacle for solid waste. As the weather got warmer, the smell got stronger. The flies were incessant.\n\nWith only one roll of toilet paper a week to be split among 10 people, Katelyn would resort to cleaning herself with sticks and leaves.\n\n\"It was just so nasty,\" she says. \"They didn't care. ... (It was) just another form of dehumanizing you and taking away your dignity.\"\n\nShe was 16 when she first arrived with only a few items, all stuffed into a 40-pound backpack.\n\nThe first activity? A grueling 3-mile hike.\n\n\"I was terrified,\" says Katelyn, now in her 20s.\"I missed my family more than anything. I just remember feeling so helpless. It's like you're living in this existence, but you don't have free will, you don't have autonomy, and they make that very clear to you. They make it very clear to you that you are a patient. You have no freedom. You have no choice.\"\n\nKatelyn is one of many former campers coming forward to share their experiences with wilderness therapy, a type of treatment parents often turn to when they feel they need professional help for their kids and counseling isn't enough.\n\nIn recent years, the \"troubled teen industry,\" which includes reform schools and residential treatment facilities, has come under scrutiny as former students speak out about the alleged mistreatment they experienced. (One big name who has elevated the cause is Paris Hilton.) But as the industry overall inches toward reform, wilderness therapy tends to fly under the radar.\n\nThat's because it's often billed as a shorter-term solution to problems (the typical wilderness program runs about 90 days), and there's also a lack of federal oversight into these private programs, experts say. In brochures and online, these programs look idyllic, touting an opportunity for children struggling with a myriad of behavioral issues to \"connect with nature\" and \"find hope and healing.\"\n\nBut former campers who spoke with USA TODAY paint a different picture. They tell of being abused by staff, of fearing punishment at all hours. They describe living in filth.\n\nThey call themselves survivors.\n\nAnd, perhaps most telling, they say wilderness therapy served as the gateway to separate, longer-term residential treatment centers. Of the dozen former campers USA TODAY spoke to, nine were sent for further treatment. None say wilderness therapy helped them with their struggles. All described their experience as negative and traumatizing.\n\nDespite accusations of abuse and experts in the field denouncing this type of treatment, some remain staunch proponents of wilderness therapy, saying it worked for their families. And even with past lawsuits and viral horror stories, wilderness therapy is still a booming industry in the U.S. today.\n\nDespite allegations, deaths wilderness therapy lives on\n\nWilderness therapy has existed in some form for more than half a century, gaining steam in the ‘90s with programs promising the healing power of nature could cure any problems parents faced with their kids. The pandemic gave it an extra bump.\n\n\"Business was booming for them (during COVID-19),\" says Jonathan Hyde, a former staffer who took a job at North Carolina-based wilderness program Trails Carolina in 2020. \"People were at their wits' end at home, and their kids (were) acting up, so they (sent them) off.\"\n\nIn the United States, there are about 40 wilderness therapy programs – part of 2,000 overall \"troubled teen\" programs, with anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 children now enrolled, says Bobby Cook, executive director and chief operational officer of Breaking Code Silence, a nonprofit that advocates against the troubled teen industry. The approaches of these programs vary, as do the reasons that parents send their teens to them.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to wilderness therapy programs and their proponents, who defended their practices as enriching and beneficial to participants. Trails Carolina, for example, says it fully trains its staff, involves parents in the process and develops individual treatment plans for each student. Many claim those who completed the therapy fully recovered from disorders such as depression and anxiety.\n\nBut critics point to the number of allegations and deaths at wilderness therapy camps as a clear sign that parents, legislators and the media need to be looking more closely at these institutions.\n\nAmong the fatalities: In 1990, 16-year-old Kristen Chase died of heatstroke three days after arriving at her wilderness program. In 2000, 15-year-old William Edward Lee died from a head injury after being restrained by staff; 14-year-old Ian August died of hyperthermia at his wilderness therapy program two years later. The same year, Charles Moody, 17, died of asphyxiation after being restrained. In 2005, Anthony Haynes, 14, died while being punished at a wilderness boot camp. In 2007, Caleb Jensen, 15, died while at a wilderness camp, his body found bundled in a feces- and urine-soaked sleeping bag. In 2011, Daniel Huerta, 17, died while being driven by a staff member. In 2016, 19-year-old Lane Lesko died during an escape attempt at a hybrid wilderness-residential treatment center.\n\n‘I was so desperate’\n\nMost parents don't send their kids off to wilderness therapy at the first sign of a problem. Rather, kids wind up there after their parents feel they've exhausted all other options.\n\nKatelyn's mother, Tessie Schmisseur, learned about wilderness therapy through a friend-recommended educational consultant, whom she describes as a \"very demanding, pushy ... high-pressure salesperson.\"\n\n\"I was just an anxious mom. I loved (Katelyn) to death,\" she says. \"I was so desperate and desperately wanting to save my child from herself.\"\n\nKatelyn had begun drinking and sneaking out, and that coupled with her bulimia had her parents panicked. They'd tried every punishment they could think of, including removing her door and boarding up her windows.\n\nThe final option? A wilderness therapy program called Evoke Entrada that the consultant highly recommended.\n\nTessie was resistant. The consultant often rubbed her the wrong way, but she convinced the Schmisseurs the program was for the best. And in three days, Katelyn was shipped off to Utah, clueless about where she was going.\n\n\"We had to pretend that everything was OK,\" Tessie says, choking up. \"The education consultant all along was like, 'It's fine, I've worked with (the program before). You need to listen to me' ... And so we did. We did what we were told because we wanted the best for her. And in hindsight, it was the very wrong decision.\"\n\nHyde, the former staffer from a different program, says he remembers a 16-year-old girl who was at the top of her class and even held a manager position at her job. \"The mom had died and the dad sent her away, because he found out that she (had become sexually active),\" he recalls.\n\n\"The kid got sent away as this form of punishment. ... That's not therapeutic, right? You can't help people out while you're punishing them.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evoke said the program's goal is to help both children and parents.\"My experience is that the mass majority of everybody is having wonderful experiences,\" the spokesperson said, \"but those who have wonderful experiences and speak out about it get bullied and shut down.”\n\n‘I could barely move’\n\nKyra Frankowski says she saw no shortage of punishments during her stay at Second Nature Wilderness, where she was sent when she was 14.\n\nWith a plastic tarp for shelter, Kyra and her fellow campers battled freezing temperatures in Utah in January 2014, layering their few items of clothing to keep warm.\n\nBecause there was often snow, the ground stayed wet. It once took them six hours to make a fire.\n\nThis was one of several \"consequences,\" or punishments, campers experienced if someone disobeyed a rule, she says. Unnecessary physical exertion was another, such as pack drills, where they were given under a minute to unpack and repack their bags. And it had to be done correctly, with the proper organization, or it would be repeated until it could be done within the time limit.\n\nOne night, her shoes were taken from her and she was forcibly wrapped in her tarp, she says. A staff member held down one side to prevent her from escaping, leaving an opening near her head to allow her to breathe. She says she stayed like that all night, unable to move.\n\nAs a sexual assault survivor, Kyra was particularly distressed that a male staffer was sleeping next to her, holding her in place. \"They'd wrap it so tight I could barely move my hands.\"\n\nSecond Nature did not respond to USA TODAY's multiple requests for comment about Kyra's allegations.\n\nEvery other week, Kyra and her peers would take makeshift sponge baths, dipping a bandana into a bucket of water and dabbing it with a bit of soap.\n\n\"At the end you would just rinse yourself off with whatever water was left over. It was very difficult to get properly cleaned.\"\n\nDuring the coldest months, she says, campers would forgo these baths altogether in favor of staying warm.\n\n\"We were very dirty.\"\n\n‘I would not wish this on anybody’\n\nTessie cried every day while her daughter was away, but Katelyn never knew.\n\n\"They would tell us ... 'You may not tell her that you love her. You may not tell her that you miss her; you may not give her any hope of coming home.\" And, Tessie says, the staff would dismiss and discredit anything negative about the program that was conveyed in Katelyn's letters, telling her family: \"She is going to say whatever (it takes) because, of course, she wants to come home.\"\n\nBut the conditions, as they learned later, \"were horrible.\"\n\n\"We weren't aware of all this,\" Tessie says through tears. \"I would not wish this on anybody, knowing what I know now. I always tell her she's the most courageous person I know.\"\n\nKatelyn feared retaliation if she spoke freely about what she was witnessing.\n\n\"You couldn't complain. It really broke me down to the smallest I've ever been in my life. It was terrifying. ... I remember just feeling like I had no voice. I had nothing.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Evoke said students' letters are not monitored, but parents may send letters to the therapist for feedback.\n\nEvoke is committed to the \"emotional and physical safety\" of participants, the spokesperson said, adding the program encourages anyone with complaints of abuse or mistreatment to report their concerns. \"We support healing and growth and that can only happen in the context of emotional safety.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added, \"Anybody who experiences abuse from any program should have their voice heard. Any program that practices punitive, shameful, controlling, coercive, intimidating behavior should be reprimanded, if not shut down.\"\n\n‘I didn’t feel prepared’\n\nA nature enthusiast, Hyde, 35, had years of experience with recreational outdoor activities. So when the pandemic left him unemployed, he got a job as a \"wilderness field instructor\" at Trails Carolina.\n\nHe was familiar with the reputation of the wilderness therapy industry. In 2014, 17-year-old Alec Lansing died while running away from the same program. But Hyde assumed the claims of mistreatment he had heard whispers about had improved.\n\nHe says now that notion was wrong.\n\nAccording to its website, the program's groups are led by \"experienced, licensed therapists who specialize in working with youth who fit their group’s profile.\"\n\n\"There was a couple of weeks there where the licensed therapist wouldn't even show up to that group, and it was her assistant who didn't even have credentials,\" he says. \"If you're paying that much money, I would think you'd be getting therapy multiple times a week.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, Trails Carolina said primary therapists are on site \"two to three days per week\" to oversee each participant's individualized treatment plan and monitor progress.\n\n\"Therapeutic progress occurs seven days a week in the field through the assignments, activities and challenges outlined in each student’s treatment plan to help them grow emotionally and develop transferable skills that can be used outside the program in real life,\" Trails Carolina said in an emailed statement.\n\nWhile students also participated in activities like art or yoga once a week, Hyde doesn't believe most campers got the professional help they needed.\n\n\"Whenever the therapist did come in, it was pretty rare that they actually would talk to us – the people that had been with the kids for this lengthy amount of time – just to see how the week had (gone).\"\n\nThe remainder of the 24/7 schedule was spent with field instructors like himself, who he felt were ill-equipped to handle the level of care some of the campers needed.\n\n\"Some of these kids are trying to kill themselves. I didn't feel really prepared for exactly what I was getting into.\"\n\nThat was in part, he says, because what was supposed to be a five-day training was cut in half and mostly focused on what type of gear they were allowed to bring, what tools and restraints they would have at their disposal. Hyde says he was let go when he pushed back on some of the program's practices.\n\nTrails Carolina says its staff partakes in a long list of training, including sessions in first aid, nutrition, suicide prevention and crisis de-escalation. The program denied Hyde's version of events and said he was dismissed for violating the program's policies and philosophies.\n\nCook, of the nonprofit Breaking Code Silence, says there's often a disconnect between what programs promise and what they deliver in almost every area, from credentials to care.\n\n\"A lot of programs, not all of them but a lot, have had experiences where the staff of the schools are not certified to be doing what they're doing,\" Cook says. \"There are therapists who weren't necessarily qualified in that area to be working in that realm.\"\n\nAs a mom, Tessie trusted the nearly $60,000, three-month Evoke Entrada program would have top-notch staffing.\n\n\"They're going to take care of her, the counselors are there, don't worry about it,\" she remembers telling herself. \"But it really appeared that they were young adults watching over them that weren't really equipped or specialized. Just older kids watching over younger kids.\"\n\nThe program wielded more power over Tessie and her family than she expected.\n\n\"They just made it seem like (she was) such a rotten kid and that she couldn't come home after the wilderness program,\" she says, instead suggesting Katelyn go to an aftercare program.\n\nIn her heart, Tessie felt it was time for Katelyn to come home, but the smiling photos she received of Katelyn at camp helped convince her that everything was fine.\n\nPlus, after spending so much money on the program, she wanted to believe in it. Tessie's parents loaned her $20,000 to cover the cost of Katelyn's aftercare after the wilderness program had put a strain on them financially.\n\n\"It's just misleading to parents,\" she says.\n\n‘Just trying to survive’\n\nDuring the intake process, staff stripped Katelyn of all her clothes, jewelry and electronics.\n\nIn return, she was given three pairs of underwear, one T-shirt, a pair of cargo pants, socks, shoes and a sleeping bag – nothing that would help her keep track of time.\n\nShe understood this to be an intentional strategy to \"strip us of our autonomy.\"\n\nKyra's program also kept her in the dark about timelines and release dates.\n\n\"They don't tell you even around when you might be leaving because that's 'future tripping.' 'You're getting lost in future thought,'\" she recalls being told. Instead, she was told to stay focused on the present, which was \"very difficult\" given the circumstances.\n\n\"I felt like I was stripped down to my most vulnerable point,\" she says. \"That's what they would say was the point. They were trying to 'break us down so they could build us back up.'\"\n\nThe breaking down she felt – but not the building up.\n\n\"We were just at our most raw, vulnerable state, just trying to survive.\"\n\nHyde remembers a student who \"basically snapped\" after finding out, instead of getting out and going back home, his family was sending him to a therapeutic boarding school.\n\n\"He fought so hard that he went unconscious and was limp in my arms,\" Hyde recalls. \"The thought that I had a dead child in my arms – that was terrifying.\"Hyde says the teen eventually recovered. ​​​​​Trails Carolina said the program has no record of a participant falling unconscious in the field.\n\nWhy critics say wilderness therapy fails\n\nIt's true, nature can be healing. And a nontraditional therapy route can be beneficial for some people. There are people who say wilderness therapy saved their lives, and some parents insist it stopped their children from going down a destructive path.\n\nMichael Gass, a professor in the Outdoor Education Program at the University of New Hampshire and director of the Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare Center, say his years of research led to positive findings, showing wilderness therapy to be safe and effective.\n\nBut critics have lambasted his findings as it has ties to the leaders of some of these institutions. (In 2018, Gass co-wrote a study with Steven DeMille, the executive director of a Utah-based wilderness program at the time.) Gass also acknowledged no randomized controlled trials have proved the efficacy of wilderness therapy.\n\nOthers argue even if wilderness therapy is effectual for some, its premise is flawed.\n\n\"If a child is yanked out of his or her home, taken to somewhere that they are highly resistant to – we're now adding the element of additional trauma,\" says Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of \"Joy from Fear.\"\n\nWhen it comes to trauma-informed care, it's critical that participants have both consent and bodily autonomy, said Andrew Kerbs, who holds a master's degree in clinical mental health counseling. But during his time as a clinical intern at Trails Carolina, he saw neither.\n\n\"Those are two things that are completely robbed of the kids that are being sent to these programs,\" said Kerbs, who worked for the program in 2016.\n\nHe doesn’t believe using a punishment-based model is helpful, either.\n\n“Whether that's the intention or not is besides the point. Intentions are important, but impact is still the most important … and a lot of kids are coming out of these feeling like it was a punishment. They didn't have a choice.”\n\nPrograms may take in kids dealing with a laundry list of challenges, from rebellious behavior and video game addictions to eating disorders and violent tendencies. And then, Cook says some programs may often attempt to resolve issues in group therapy that may rely on tactics like \"attack therapy,\" in which one child is singled out to discuss their struggle. Experts agree this approach is not the preferred solution.\n\nIf programs pathologize some teen behaviors, parents are often frightened, leaving them to feel as if sending their kid away is their only option. This messaging may be underscored by consultants recommending the programs.\n\n\"Instead of saying to a parent, 'Your kid is starting to have sex, and I know that's scary, but here's what we can do to better support them.' They're saying, 'Oh my God, they're gonna end up as a prostitute. You better send them away so they don't end up pole dancing,'\" says Meg Appelgate, co-founder and CEO of the prevention organization Unsilenced, who also holds a degree in psychology.\n\nIt's normal for preteens and teenagers to push limits as they establish their identity.\n\n\"They're testing out what it feels like to be independent, what it feels like to make your own decisions,\" she says. \"During these times you're going to see kids sneaking out, breaking the rules ... going against authority.\"\n\nShe urges parents to understand the implications of labeling their child as \"troubled\" or \"a problem.\"\n\nA survivor of the troubled teen industry herself, she cautions, \"It really follows you throughout your life.\"\n\nThe lasting impact of wilderness therapy\n\nAppelgate still lives with the effects of the treatment program she attended at 15. She wakes up to panic attacks because she was abducted in the middle of the night to be transported to her program. She eats quickly because otherwise she wouldn't have a chance to get more food.\n\n\"It becomes habit,\" she says. \"These little things that they think aren't affecting kids are highly affecting them.\"\n\nThrough Appelgate's work, she has seen wilderness therapy survivors suffering with a variety of mental health challenges, from post-traumatic stress disorder to anxiety and depression.\n\nAfter being cut off from the world, it can be difficult to reintegrate into society. Relationships can suffer, including between a parent and child. A strong distrust in authority figures can form.\n\n\"Trauma, even though it may be one incident, can certainly cause pervasive long-lasting damage in many areas of life that may seem wholly unrelated to the causal incident,\" Manly says.\n\nAppelgate sees trauma coming from two main sources, from the experience itself and from being sent away and forced to live without a support system.\n\n\"Some people legitimately may have a good experience. I think that for 99% (of people), that's not the case,\" Appelgate says.\n\nThis is because the same event can be perceived differently depending on the person. One child may experience something as traumatic while another doesn't, Manly explains.\n\nResearch shows stress affects the nervous system and can even cause structural changes in the brain, which can change how we think and alter our memory. Stress can also weaken our immune system and exacerbate preexisting health conditions like cardiovascular disease or respiratory problems.\n\n\"The earlier (in life) the trauma, typically the more impactful it's going to be and the longer lasting impact we're going to see from that trauma,\" says Whitney Goodman, licensed psychotherapist and author of \"Toxic Positivity.\"\n\nChronic stress:Your body is trying to tell you something\n\n‘What happened ... shaped my entire personality’\n\nPrograms do a \"really good job of explaining things away to parents,\" Appelgate says, whether it's a negative review (look at the positive ones, too!), an active investigation or even a death.\n\nThey do this by telling parents they've changed policies so a certain incident \"won't happen again,\" blaming it on staffers whom they've since fired or changing the name of a program to escape bad PR. Katelyn's program, for example, used to be named Second Nature Entrada but went through a rebrand in 2015 after years of abuse allegations.\n\nPlus, experts question whether improvement in a child based on forced change equates to actual improvement.\n\n\"You can create compliance through punitive measures, but that's not equipping somebody with the resources to show up in the world as an autonomous adult,\" Kerbs says.\n\nWith more than 75,000 pieces of information on more than 3,500 programs (both shuttered and operating), Unsilenced says its searchable program archive is helping to force transparency by making info easily available for both parents and survivors.\n\nBut there's an urgent need for federal oversight, advocates say.\n\nLooking back on their experiences, Kyra and Katelyn's voices have strengthened, aided by the community of survivors they've bonded with online. TikTok has served as an informal support group, with the hashtag #wildernesstherapy garnering millions of views.\n\nBut for Kyra, the anxiety and depression she entered camp with never improved. On top of that, she was diagnosed with PTSD and her relationship with her parents disintegrated.\n\n\"I just didn't trust them,\" she says. \"I didn't want to tell them anything I was struggling with.\"\n\nKatelyn remembers thinking that once she was back home, things were going to get better and \"everything was going to be perfect.\"\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nWilderness didn't help her eating disorder. After being released from both her programs, she had the hardest relapse she'd ever had.\n\nNow living in Orange Country, California, a senior in college, she has come a long way. But her past still stares her down.\n\n\"What happened to me there has shaped my entire personality,\" she says. She has still struggled with bulimia in the years since her release, and she now suffers from PTSD and manic depression.\n\n\"If anything, I’m so much worse off after these programs. They ruined my life.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/20"}]}

So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away. Nadine Smith, executive director, Equality Florida\n\nMore fundamentally, these red state moves are remaking the American civil liberties landscape at breathtaking speed – and with little national attention to their cumulative effect. Taken together, these moves amount to a stark reversal of what many legal scholars call the “rights revolution” beginning in the 1960s, in which Congress and especially the Supreme Court expanded the number of rights available to all Americans nationwide and struck down state laws that constricted those rights on issues from racial segregation to abortion and same-sex marriage. In many ways, the red states are attempting to tilt the nation back toward a pre-1960s model, when the basic civil rights and civil liberties available to Americans diverged far more depending on where they lived.\n\nFurther, with GOP senators wielding the filibuster and the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court both providing powerful air cover for this red state ground offensive, Democrats and groups focused on defending civil rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, among other issues, have not yet found any effective means of slowing the conservative onslaught. Even as the nation grows more racially, religiously and culturally diverse than ever, that means roughly half the states are on track to impose rules across this broad array of cultural flashpoints that primarily reflect the demands of one shrinking group: conservative and often older White Christians.\n\n“You have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House,” says Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy group battling against the “don’t say gay” proposals from Florida Republicans that would severely restrict how teachers can talk about sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom. “So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away.”\n\nAnti-abortion activists protest outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic on January 20, 2022, in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nConservatives praise the widening divergence among the states on this broad array of issues as a vindication of the belief among the nation’s founders that states should have great leeway to set their own courses – a belief embodied in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n“This is going to be a new test of federalism,” Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative group that has promoted some of the conservative state initiatives, told me in a 2021 interview. “But I think it’s a good thing, and it’s largely how the founders envisioned this.”\n\nA wide array of groups that promote civil rights and liberties, however, see the red state moves as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights that should be available nationwide to all Americans.\n\n“We are absolutely seeing what feels like two countries – opposed on so many fundamental questions,” Deborah Archer, a professor at the New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me in an email. “That’s the reality we are facing with abortion rights – pregnant people with fundamentally different protection of their Constitutional rights based on geography. That’s the reality we may face with voting rights – Black voters with fundamentally different rights based on geography. That’s the reality we are facing with the censorship of discussions about race in the classroom – children getting wildly different opportunities to learn about the history and reality of racism and racial inequality based on geography.”\n\nThe one undisputed point: On a panoramic range of volatile issues revolving around cultural values and racial equity, Republican-controlled states are advancing the most aggressive conservative agenda in memory. In a comment echoed to me by analysts in other states, political scientist Richard Murray, a senior researcher at the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, described last year’s Texas state legislative session as “the most extreme session in modern Texas history. I’ve been here since 1966 and nothing was comparable in all of those years.”\n\nFronts in the fight\n\nThe red state offensive is advancing across a wide range of fronts, including:\n\nAbortion: Anticipating that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority later this year will strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, GOP-controlled states are approving a raft of new restrictions on the procedure. Seven states in 2021 passed laws retrenching access to abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute; that list included total bans that Texas and Oklahoma approved to go into effect if the high court allows. Texas also passed its separate law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and empowering citizens to sue anyone involved in providing one; five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices, over the vehement objections of Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees, have refused to block implementation of that law while lower courts debate its constitutionality.\n\nIn all, Guttmacher calculated, states approved 108 abortion restrictions of some sort in 2021 (such as constraints on access to abortion medication). The group says that’s by far the most that have been approved in any single year since Roe. And the wave has not yet crested: Just this month, GOP-controlled legislatures in Florida, West Virginia and Arizona, anticipating that the GOP Supreme Court majority will overturn Roe, have advanced bills to ban abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nVoting: Laws making it more difficult to vote, and in several cases increasing the opportunity for Republican partisans to exert more influence over election administration and vote tabulation, have been probably the most visible component of the red state push. In 2021, 19 states – including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Montana and Texas – passed a total of 34 laws restricting access to voting, according to tabulations by the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. The center counts 250 bills to further restrict voting access that have been introduced this year or carried over from last year’s session and another 41 that could erode the integrity of election administration. Meanwhile, the new voter identification requirements in Texas have resulted in the rejection of so many mail ballots that local Democratic officials in Harris County have asked the US Justice Department to intervene.\n\nEducation: Nothing has spread more rapidly across the red states than the laws – dubbed “gag orders” by critics – restricting how public school K-12 teachers can talk about current and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed laws establishing such restrictions and four others imposed them through executive branch actions. This year, according to PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors, 112 similar bills have been introduced in 34 states.\n\nVariations on the theme are multiplying: Virginia’s newly elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, has created a “tip line” that residents can use to complain about teachers discussing supposedly “divisive” concepts. Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature is considering legislation to install cameras in every classroom so that parents or others can monitor what teachers are saying.\n\nThis push to control what students are taught is also broadening in several ways. On one front, more of the red state bills would impose restrictions not only on K-12 teachers, but also on professors in public colleges and universities; PEN counts 48 such bills pending. Last week, Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the state’s social conservatives, said he will push legislation to both end tenure for new hires at the University of Texas and make it easier to revoke tenure for professors who teach critical race theory, an academic analysis that explores structural racism.\n\nOn another front, Republican-controlled states are pushing beyond race and gender inequities to advance legislation that limits how public schools discuss sexual orientation and gender identity or bars it completely for younger students. The most prominent of these bills – the Florida legislation that critics have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill – could receive approval from the full state House of Representatives this week, with the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In all, nine states are considering 15 similar bills, according to PEN America.\n\nOn yet another front, more states and local school districts are banning books, including many by authors who are racial minorities or who identify as LGBTQ: The American Library Association told me in an email that its Office for Intellectual Freedom has received more than 330 reports of attempted book bans from just September through November 2021. Finally, several of the red state education proposals borrow from the new Texas abortion statute and empower private citizens to sue schools or school districts if they object to how teachers discuss the restricted topics.\n\nLGBTQ rights: The Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, says 10 states in 2021 adopted 26 bills restricting their rights. One of the most common themes has been legislation prohibiting transgender girls and women from participating in high school and often college-level sports; among the eight states that approved such bans in 2021 were Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Republican-controlled states, this wave also shows no sign of cresting: South Dakota recently approved its own ban, proposals are advancing in Kentucky and Utah, and the Human Rights Campaign counts 56 sports bans pending across the states.\n\nOn a parallel track, Tennessee last year approved legislation requiring students to use the bathrooms for their genders at birth, and Arkansas’ GOP-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to approve the nation’s first law prohibiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people below age 18; Tennessee also approved such a ban. Texas’ GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion last Friday that such treatments constituted “child abuse” under Texas law.\n\nThe left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door. People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ Bill Miller, lobbyist and political consultant in Texas\n\nProtest rights: In the aftermath of 2020’s massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations, multiple Republican-controlled states – including Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas – have approved laws stiffening penalties on protesters accused of damaging property. In a few cases, red states have also approved laws immunizing drivers who run over protesters if they are caught in demonstrations. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks these proposals, counts more than a dozen that have been approved since 2020, with 17 more pending this year, preponderantly in Republican-controlled states.\n\nGun rights: In sharp contrast to the laws limiting rights across all the arenas discussed above, red states are rushing to loosen restrictions on gun owners. In 2021, five Republican-controlled states, including Montana, Tennessee and Texas, eliminated requirements for gun owners to receive permits or undergo training before being allowed to carry concealed handguns – or in some cases before being allowed to openly carry weapons, according to tracking by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. This year the group says seven more Republican-controlled states are moving to eliminate such requirements; three of them (Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina) would allow the open carrying of handguns without any training or permitting.\n\nThe sweep of this challenge has left civil rights and liberties groups gasping. “What is disturbing is how … many of the legal protections are falling at the same time,” says Archer, the ACLU president. “We have seen the protection of our civil rights and civil liberties being chipped away, death by a thousand cuts. Today, we are seeing more protections torn down all at once.”\n\nDemocrats in Washington have found no effective response. The House has passed legislation to reverse many of the state voting restrictions and to codify the national right to abortion, but a Republican Senate filibuster blocked the former last month and is expected to similarly doom the latter next week.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor congressional Democrats have focused much attention on the other state restrictions (particularly the educational “gag orders”), much less devised an approach to resist them. While the red state offensive has advanced, Democrats have been much more consumed by the critique from party centrists that liberals are pushing excessively “woke” policies on public safety and schooling.\n\nWhy this is happening, and why now\n\nMultiple factors probably explain why Republican-controlled states are simultaneously moving so quickly across so many fronts. Anderson, from Heritage Action, says a key factor is that conservative activists have shifted their attention more to state and local governments. That shift has occurred, she says, both because they realize they have few opportunities to advance their priorities at the national level while Democrats control the White House and Congress and also because the Covid-19 crisis made them realize that local decisions “probably impact their day-to-day [life] more than even federal.”\n\nBill Miller, a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties in Texas, says the hard push from social conservatives there reflects a long-gestating backlash on the right to the left’s efforts to advance socially liberal causes, such as more explicit discussion of racial issues in the schools.\n\n“The left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door,” he says in a view echoed by Anderson. “People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ “\n\nOthers see the key factor as the shifting internal dynamics of the Republican coalition. Particularly in the Trump era, the GOP has become more dominant among the White voters who are the most uneasy about cultural and demographic change. Those voters, energized by Trump, are creating enormous demand in the party for hardline policies on race and culture.\n\nThere is definitely a difference between action and words. Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming. Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer\n\nThe widespread gerrymandering of state legislative disticts, experts say, has magnified the influence of those voters because it means that almost all GOP lawmakers are running in staunchly conservative districts where they face more risk of losing primaries to opponents on their right than they do of losing general elections to opponents on their left. Murray, the Texas political scientist, says Republican primaries there typically attract only about one-fourth as many voters as the party wins in presidential general elections and those who do turn out “are disproportionately the cultural warriors.”\n\nOther institutional factors have propelled the rapid dispersion of these ideas across red states. Conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Action energetically encourage Republican legislators to adopt many of these proposals; Heritage, for instance, recently issued a strategy memo urging red state legislatures “to embrace the culture war” over the teaching of race and sexual orientation as a means of building support for vouchers that would provide parents public funds to send their kids to private schools, a perennial goal on the right.\n\nThe increasing reliance of right-leaning voters on explicitly conservative media sources that relentlessly stoke cultural and racial grievance, from Fox to talk radio, also provides a powerful transmission belt.\n\n“The nationalization of media, aided by social media and the internet, is part of the story,” says Jake Grumbach, a political scientist at the University of Washington and author of an upcoming book on the polarization of state policy. “This kind of environment means that agendas can be set, with similar talking points and framing, across states very quickly.”\n\nAnother factor has been the indications from the Republican majority on the Supreme Court that it is unlikely to resist many of these red state initiatives. The red states “feel completely emboldened by the Supreme Court,” says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state legislative races. In particular, she believes, the court’s “lack of action on the Texas case” authorizing private lawsuits against abortions “lit a wildfire of socially conservative legislation.”\n\nAlso critical, many analysts say, is the erosion of resistance from business groups. Under pressure from employees and consumers, business groups often pushed back forcefully during the early stages of this wave – for instance, with boycotts of North Carolina after Republicans there passed the original “bathroom bill” for transgender individuals in 2016.\n\nBut apart from modest public criticism of some of the voting laws, business has mostly stood to the side amid this new spasm of socially conservative legislation – even, critics note, when the bills directly contradict their public claims to support LGBTQ rights or racial equity. The journalist and activist Judd Legum, for instance, has documented that multiple companies that publicly proclaim their support for LGBTQ rights are heavily contributing to the Florida Republican legislators pushing the “don’t say gay” bill.\n\n“There is definitely a difference between action and words,” says Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming.”\n\nRepublicans in these states also may have been emboldened because Democrats, after making gains in 2018, failed to flip any of the state legislative chambers they targeted in 2020. Now Republicans have been able to fortify their legislative majorities in many states with strong gerrymanders, while Democrats face the headwind of diminished approval ratings for President Joe Biden even among the suburban voters who powered their state-level wins during the Trump years.\n\nLike many red state GOP strategists, Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak says, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s [social issue] priorities.” He predicts that Republicans will actually gain in those areas “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.”\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful reason for this surge of culturally conservative legislation is the force and immediacy of the wave it seeks to counter. The evidence of irreversible demographic and cultural change continues to accumulate: The 2020 census, for the first time, recorded that kids of color now constitute a majority of the nation’s under-18 population; Gallup recently reported that a stunning one-fifth of Generation Z (as well as about 1 in 10 millennials) identifies as LGBTQ; and the latest figures from the Public Religion Research Institute show that White Christians, long the nation’s majority, now compose only a little more than two-fifths of the population.\n\nAll of that, critics argue, has created a sense of urgency for GOP state legislators responding to voters in their coalition uneasy about the “more diverse” future “that is around the corner,” as Martinez Fischer puts it. An America in which no single group makes up a majority “is arriving, and so there’s only two paths,” says Smith of Equality Florida. “One is division, chaos, suppression, censorship, surveillance and anti-immigrant sentiment. The alternative is a [way] forward, where regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, there is a path here for everyone.”\n\nThe striking implication of the GOP’s ongoing revolution from below is that the coming decade may see the nation’s 50 states diverge between those two paths more than they have at any point since the Supreme Court and Congress began nationalizing more civil rights and liberties over half a century ago.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/23/state-by-state-abortion-laws-dobbs-anniversary/73769814007/", "title": "State abortion law changes, challenges since Dobbs ruling: A ...", "text": "Monday marks two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe Dobbs decision issued June 24, 2022 upheld Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks.

Wade, the 50-year-old court precedent enshrining a right to abortion.\n\nDoing so now gives state lawmakers the green light to aggressively limit or ban abortion.\n\nSince a draft for Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked last month, CNN readers have asked hundreds of questions about what a reversal of the Supreme Court’s abortion rights precedents would mean and how it will affect access to the procedure. The final decision released Friday closely tracked the leaked draft.\n\nWe’re reading as many questions as we can and answering some of the most popular here.\n\nIs the Supreme Court actually overturning the law or merely saying the decision belongs with each state’s law?\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned previous court precedent that preempted state laws banning abortion before the fetus is viable, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. In overturning the Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood decisions, the Supreme Court allows states to pursue bans and other restrictions on pre-viability abortion.\n\nThe ruling will not have the effect of banning abortion nationwide. According to the logic expressed in the draft decision (and with the caveat that it can still be changed before the final opinion comes out), the question of abortion policy would then go to state and local lawmakers – and potentially federal lawmakers as well.\n\nWill women get arrested for having an abortion if the Supreme Court deems it illegal?\n\nAn abortion-seeker’s criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place.\n\nLeaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldn’t be prosecuted for obtaining abortion, and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that would go into effect with a Roe reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion, but an abortion ban in Wyoming appears to muddle this question with its reference to the “pregnant woman” in the relevant code.\n\nThere’s also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. A state legislator in Louisiana recently proposed a bill that would charge women with murder for obtaining abortion, though that bill failed to advance. Critics of the anti-abortion movement also note that, even with Roe on the books, women have been prosecuted for pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nWhat methods do lawmakers propose to enforce these laws? What can they legally do to find out if someone is pregnant?\n\nThe state abortion prohibitions that will go into effect with the Roe reversal don’t spell out specific enforcement tactics. The lengths local prosecutors will go to enforce abortion restrictions is very much an unanswered question. Before Roe, the aggressiveness of the enforcement of abortion bans often depended on the political environment, including the local environment that prosecutors were navigating. Now, some prosecutors in Democratic-leaning jurisdictions are vowing to not bring criminal charges under abortion restrictions that go into effect with the new Supreme Court opinion.\n\nThe information the prosecutors will seek from health care providers in order to enforce abortion bans IS very much a concern for reproductive rights advocates. HIPAA protections that typically shield an individual’s medical information from disclosure have exemptions for certain law enforcement contexts that may come into play if Roe is overturned. Likewise, there are concerns that the data that can be obtained from an abortion-seeker’s digital devices may be used to determine if she obtained an abortion. That could include information about her menstrual cycle in a period-tracking application, some fear, or search terms she uses for internet searches.\n\nBased on the legal arguments contained in the leaked draft opinion, are there any other legal precedents and SCOTUS opinions that this ruling would overturn beyond Roe v Wade? What further rights and privileges could be at risk of being scaled back if the draft becomes the law of the land?\n\nThe draft Dobbs opinion – if it became the court’s formal ruling – wouldn’t overturn other closely watched precedents in areas like same-sex marriage, contraception and interracial marriage. Those cases, like abortion, are grounded in a right to privacy that is not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, but that the court has said is implied. The Supreme Court, in handing down Roe and its successor Casey, tied the right to an abortion to the precedents in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut and 1967’s Loving v. Virginia, which struck down state restrictions on contraceptives and interracial marriage, respectively. The 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling invalidating Texas’ anti-sodomy law and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide relied on Loving and Griswold as well.\n\nIn the Dobbs draft that leaked, Alito went out of his way in his draft to describe Roe as distinct from those other rulings grounded in a right to privacy because, he wrote, “Abortion destroys…potential life.”\n\n“None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite,” Alito wrote. “They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.”\n\nStill, skeptics see the Roe reversal as opening the door to challenges to those other precedents, with Obergefell being the most vulnerable. Alito himself wrote a dissent to the 2015 ruling that argued that “The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right.”\n\nConservative lawmakers and legal advocates have also argued the court’s Obergefell precedent makes the same errors the court made in enshrining abortion rights.\n\nThe Mississippi law at issue bans abortion starting from 15 weeks after the last menstrual period. If the Supreme Court allows this law to stand, will it then be legal to ban abortion at earlier points in pregnancy? Will it be possible for states to ban medication-induced first-trimester abortions, which are the most common type? Many states seem poised to do so.\n\nIf the draft opinion that was leaked was adopted, not only would the Mississippi 15-week ban be upheld, but states – and potentially the federal government – would be allowed to ban abortion earlier in the pregnancy, including medication-induced first trimester abortions. More than a dozen states have so-called “trigger laws,” under which bans on abortion would be implemented if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and several more have other types of bans that could go into effect with the reversal of previous Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut until the court issues its final opinion, we won’t know for sure how aggressively states will be allowed to restrict abortion under the court’s new precedent.\n\nIn the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy of say 14 years old, where does the law lie for these individuals if Roe vs Wade is overturned?\n\nIf Roe is overturned, exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or health of the mother will vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.\n\nIt’s a question lawmakers will likely revisit once the Supreme Court’s ruling, assuming it overturns Roe, is handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. The six-week ban he signed into law last year – which is currently blocked by court order – included those exemptions.\n\nOn the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.\n\nHow are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?\n\nWhat a Roe reversal would mean for fertility treatments is a major uncertainty.\n\nPhysicians and legal experts in the field are currently grappling with state abortion policies frame their laws around the moment of fertilization, when the egg has united with the sperm. Some of those state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn’t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction, when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to a multiple pregnancy has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how a Roe reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures – which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.\n\nIf the current heavily conservative Supreme Court can overturn Roe v. Wade, that’s been on the books for decades, what’s to stop a future heavily liberal court from overturning this current anti-Roe v. Wade decision in say, 20 years from now?\n\nTechnically, there’s nothing to stop a Supreme Court from revisiting abortion precedent and a court with a more liberal makeup may very well do so. However, one reason that a future liberal Supreme Court majority might be disinclined to change a major precedent again is if those justices feel more loyalty to the principle of stare decisis – the legal principle that discourages overturning precedent unless certain conditions are met – than the loyalty that has been shown by the conservative majority poised to reverse Roe.\n\nThis respect for precedence, for instance, is why Chief Justice John Roberts voted in 2020 to strike down a Louisiana abortion clinic regulation, after he dissented in a 2016 case where the majority struck down a similar Texas law.\n\nCan the right to an abortion be codified by a national vote?\n\nNot directly. A constitutional amendment could be enacted to extend that right. But the process of amending US Constitution begins with a proposal that has the support of either two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or with a convention called for by two-thirds of the states. Ratification of an amendment requires the support of three-fourths of state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions in each state.\n\nWhy does the currently Democrat-controlled legislature not pass a federal law making abortion legal? This would make the SCOTUS decision a non issue.\n\nDemocrats currently lack the votes to dismantle the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote procedural mechanism that Republicans can use to block federal abortion rights legislation – so as long as 40 senators oppose abortion rights. But it’s worth noting that the Women’s Health Protection Act – a bill would codify and expand upon Roe – failed 49-51 when it was voted on in May in the Senate, meaning that, even without the filibuster, it would have not become law.\n\nThere are also legal questions about whether it would be constitutional for federal lawmakers to enact a nationwide ban. The late Justice Antonin Scalia stressed in his legal writings about abortion that the policy-decisions belonged in the hands of individual states, while expressing skepticism that Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the procedure. Friday, Alito used notably open-ended language that doesn’t limit the provenance of abortion legislation to state lawmakers.\n\nCan anti-abortion states prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion in another state? It worries me that states could enact further laws restricting women the choice to leave the state to have an abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion state lawmakers have already expressed interest in regulating conduct around abortion that happens outside of their borders. Perhaps the most aggressive example is a failed bill in Missouri that would have extended its abortion laws to out-of-state abortions if the mother is a Missouri resident or if “Sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.” That proposal hasn’t advanced, but there are other examples of this tactic that might move forward in the future. A handful of Texas lawmakers, for instance, are calling for penalties for companies that cover the costs for employees who travel out of state to obtain abortions.\n\nThe legal authority that state lawmakers have to reach beyond state lines is very much an open question and the topic of a coming law review article that provides more information about the relevant precedents.\n\nIs it possible that women and men who are pro-choice could send abortion pills to women in other states with draconian anti-abortion laws?\n\nWith medication abortion – a two pill regimen that terminates a pregnancy – becoming the method used in a majority of abortions performed nationwide, red states have already been cracking down on the mailing of abortion pills and on administering the pills without an in-person visit with a physician. These state laws started gaining steam after the FDA allowed for the mailing of abortion pills in a pandemic-related move that has now been made permanent. If Roe is overturned, medication abortion will be covered by abortion bans and we might see other types of proposals to limit medication abortion.\n\nBut how to enforce these restrictions on mailing abortion pills is another question anti-abortion lawmakers are still working through. Texas last year updated its previously existing ban on mailing abortion pills to make it the type of crime that would warrant extradition. Blue states have countered with measures that would prohibit their state authorities from cooperating with such extradition requests.\n\nThere are also international sources from which women in anti-abortion states may seek delivery of medication abortion.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/cnn-poll-abortion-roe-v-wade/index.html", "title": "CNN Poll: About two-thirds of Americans disapprove of overturning ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the US Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Most see the ruling as portending negative changes for the country as a whole and for women in their state.\n\nThe court’s ruling that there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion came down in late June following the leak of a draft opinion in early May that previewed the final outcome. Since then, legal fights over abortion rights have sprung up in more than a dozen, and Indiana this week became the first state to convene a special session of its legislature to consider more restrictive laws around abortion.\n\nAccording to the poll, those who oppose the ruling largely feel that politicians who agree with them are not going far enough to ensure abortion access. On the other side, those who approve of the ruling would rather see politicians who agree with them leave abortion restrictions up to the states than push for nationwide restrictions.\n\nOverall, 63% of US adults say they disapprove of the ruling, which upended protections for abortion that had been in place for nearly fifty years, while 37% approve of it. About half, 51%, say they disapprove strongly, including 54% of women.\n\nViews on the ruling are closely tied to a combination of ideology and party, with majorities disapproving among liberal Democrats (93%), moderate or conservative Democrats (81%), independents (71%) and moderate or liberal Republicans (55%). Among conservative Republicans, though, 85% say they approve of the ruling.\n\nAmericans younger than 45 are more likely to disapprove of the Supreme Court decision than older adults (74% among the younger group, 54% among those age 45 or older). And older women are far more likely to disapprove than older men (59% of women age 45 or older versus 48% of men in that age group).\n\nThose who disapprove of the ruling largely say that politicians who support legal abortion are not doing enough to ensure access to it (77% say they are not doing enough, 23% say they are). There is little significant variation in this view across demographic or political groups. Liberals (83%) and Democrats (82%) are only slightly more likely to feel politicians aren’t doing enough to protect access to abortion than independents who disapprove of the ruling (76%) or moderates (74%).\n\nAmong those satisfied with the ruling, there’s broad agreement that politicians who opposed Roe ought to leave it up to states to determine whether further restrictions are enacted (80% say so) rather than pushing for restrictions on abortion nationwide (20% favor that).\n\nLooking ahead to the potential effects the ruling might have, few see a direct impact on their own lives. Overall, 60% say that the court’s decision to overturn Roe will have no effect on them or their family, while 30% say it will have a negative effect and 10% say it will have a positive one. Younger women are far more apt than others to see the ruling as negatively affecting them or their family personally: 50% of women younger than 45 see a negative effect, compared with 34% among men in the same age group, 23% among women age 45 or older, and 16% among men 45 or older.\n\nMost Americans see a negative effect from the ruling on the country as a whole (68% negative) and on women in their own state (58% negative). Those views are split largely by party, with Democrats and independents more likely to see a negative outcome than Republicans on both questions. The partisan gap is broadest when considering the effect on the nation as a whole. Broad majorities of both Democrats (87%) and independents (73%) see the ruling as having a negative effect on the nation, while Republicans are about evenly divided, with 41% saying overturning Roe will have a negative effect on the country, 45% saying it will have a positive effect and 13% no effect at all. When asked about the effect on women in their own state, 73% of Democrats and 61% of independents say it will have a negative effect, compared with 38% of Republicans.\n\nThis CNN Poll was conducted July 22-24 by SSRS online, using a sample drawn from a probability-based panel.

Never.” Wyoming Gun Owners spokesman Aaron Dorr said in a Facebook video after the late-night veto.

The law signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little Wednesday creates a new crime of “abortion trafficking,” threatening prosecution for any adult who helps transport a pregnant Idaho girl to get an abortion without her parents' consent.\n\nAbortion rights advocates and legal experts say they expect other states to follow Idaho’s approach — and eventually to extend interstate travel prohibitions to adults.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not explicitly include a right to interstate travel, but it is implied. Idaho’s new law attempts to skirt that issue by criminalizing only the in-state portion of a trip to another state to procure an abortion. In other words, it focuses on transportation to the Idaho state line.\n\n“Abortion opponents are testing the waters around abortion bans with this Idaho law, because state lawmakers realize they’re facing a real uphill climb in courts because of the federal right to travel,” said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. “Other states will be watching closely to see how this plays out.”\n\nIdaho’s travel ban is based on wording in a model abortion law proposed by the National Right to Life Committee for lawmakers to introduce in their states.\n\nCarol Tobias, president of the anti-abortion organization, said the section of the model law on unlawful abortion trafficking of minors “is intended to send a strong message that parents are responsible for their girls and nobody else should be taking their daughters to medical appointments without their knowledge.”\n\nRead more:Stateline coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions\n\nProviding information on abortions is allowed under Idaho’s new criminal statute. But giving abortion pills to a pregnant girl or harboring or transporting her without a parent’s consent is punishable by two to five years in prison. The law also allows family members to sue any health care provider, whether in-state or out-of-state, who performs an abortion on an Idaho minor.\n\nRebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, told the Idaho Capital Sun that her organization intends to challenge the law.\n\nRight to travel\n\nEver since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion last June, abortion rights advocates have anticipated that states where abortion is illegal would try to prevent their residents from leaving the state to legally end their pregnancies. But the implied constitutional right to interstate travel was seen as a deterrent.\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion that the decision does not allow a state to bar a resident from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion.\n\nIdaho’s new law attempts to avoid that legal hurdle by defining the abortion trafficking crime as transporting a pregnant girl within the state. But even without that language, David Cohen, professor of law at Drexel University in Philadelphia, said Idaho’s law could survive legal challenges in state and federal courts. That’s because state constitutions vary widely on the question of interstate travel and the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly guarantee it.\n\nAs a result, Cohen and others say the issue likely will have to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\n“And given how abortion changes everything,” he said, “there’s no way to predict how the Supreme Court will rule on such a law other than to follow its views on abortion.”\n\nParental consent\n\nMinors make up only a small percentage of patients who receive abortions in the United States, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the roughly 620,000 Americans who received abortions in 2020, only 8.2% were girls aged 15 to 19, and only .2% or 1,333 were younger than 15.\n\nDespite the small numbers, state laws requiring clinicians to either notify or get the consent of parents before performing abortions on a minor have been around since the 1970s, shortly after the federal right to abortion was established by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut courts have since required states to include judicial bypass provisions that allow a judge to waive parental notification and consent requirements for minors in cases involving rape, sexual abuse, incest and other circumstances.\n\nParental consent and notice laws still exist in most states. Reproductive rights advocates argue that such laws limit minors’ rights.\n\nIn addition, two states — Arizona and Arkansas — have laws on the books that are similar to Idaho’s new law, making it a crime to help a minor get an abortion without their parents’ knowledge. But those laws — enacted when abortion was legal in every state — were intended to bar people from helping a minor leave the state to circumvent parental notice and consent laws. A 2005 Missouri law that required minors to get parental consent to travel for an out-of-state abortion was struck down.\n\nParental consent is still required in 12 states where abortion remains legal: Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina.\n\nParental notice is required in six states where abortion is legal: Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota and Montana. And both consent and notice are required in four states where abortion is legal: Florida, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nAnd in 11 states where abortion is banned — Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin — parental consent is still required. Parental notification is required in South Dakota and West Virginia, where nearly all abortions are banned, and in Georgia, where abortion is banned at six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they’re pregnant.\n\n“Right now, these teens don’t have anywhere to go, and that includes foster teens and teens whose parents may not be supportive,” said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president and director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which supports abortion rights. “Judicial bypasses are extremely difficult and traumatic for a minor to go through and challenging to get done, particularly in a timely way.\n\n“Young people who’ve been victims of sexual violence are, in many cases, unlikely to report these acts and they’re extremely vulnerable. They need an adult they can trust and, in some cases, it’s not their parent,” she said.\n\nIn Idaho, Kerry Uhlenkott, legislative coordinator for Right to Life of Idaho, said she and the new law’s sponsors were motivated by a story they heard from a single mother whose teen daughter was “trafficked” to an abortion clinic in Oregon without her knowledge.\n\n“A school counselor became aware that the girl was pregnant and took her to a clinic in Oregon without the mother’s consent,” Uhlenkott said. “The mother was horrified that this happened without her knowledge or consent, and she was just heartbroken that she wasn’t involved in the decision. That’s what got us involved.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/06/ballot-initiatives-watch-2022-midterms/7962542001/", "title": "Ballot initiatives to watch in 2022 midterms, from abortion to slavery", "text": "Four states have ballot questions related to abortion and contraceptives\n\nLegalizing marijuana will be up for voters to decided in at least five states this year\n\nOutlawing slavery and indentured servitude is a referendum in five states as well\n\nForget waiting for Congress or state legislatures to act.

But a loophole allows it as punishment for someone convicted of a crime. Roughly 20 states have a similar exception.\n\nMost of the referendums ask voters to declare no form of slavery or involuntary servitude be permitted as a punishment for a crime.\n\nOthers go further, such as Alabama's question which seeks to remove \"all racist language\" from the state constitution.

The changes would also create a regulatory agency that would oversee licensed healing centers to administer natural medicine services.\n\nMinimum wage, right to work rules\n\nNevada voters will be given a chance to give workers a pay raise this fall when they're asked to increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour for all employees. The state's floor for how much a person is paid currently sits between $9.50 to $10.50 per hour, depending on whether they have health insurance.\n\nIn 2019, the Nevada legislature passed a measure raising the minimum wage by increments without addressing the health insurance discrepancy.

Will states try to ban travel for abortion, using a model patterned on Texas’s SB8, which allows people to sue anyone who performs or aids or abets an abortion?

States could apply a model developed in the “war on drugs” to abortion pills. And after 2024, if America elects a Republican president, the Food and Drug Administration could place new restrictions on medication abortion or take pills off the market altogether.\n\nThere are other looming questions. Will states define aiding and abetting to sweep in a great deal of speech about abortion, or employer decisions to reimburse workers for travel? How will states even define “abortion” – and how will prosecutors make sense of vague definitions? With some anti-abortion groups convinced that all chemical contraceptives, including the birth control pill, are abortifacients, will contraceptive access change? Or will states seek to regulate in vitro fertilization?\n\nPresident Joe Biden has suggested that voters can solve many of these problems by electing a Democratic majority. For their part, congressional Republicans have been largely mum about a national ban (Lindsey Graham’s proposed 15-week ban was greeted by a mixture of silence and disapproval, even on the right).\n\nBut the Supreme Court is quite likely to invalidate a federal law protecting abortion rights. That’s why the ballot initiatives before midterm voters may tell us more than which party wins a congressional majority. Taking the issue directly to voters may allow supporters of abortion rights to make progress in purple or red states – and to do so even when voters are unwilling to choose Democratic candidates. Whatever happens in the midterm, one thing is clear: Conflicts about abortion in a post-Roe America are just beginning.\n\nMary Ziegler is the Martin Luther King Professor of Law at UC Davis and author of the book “Dollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment.”\n\nErika Bachiochi: Are policies that really help women too much to ask?\n\nErika Bachiochi Courtesy of Erika Bachioci\n\nSince Dobbs came down, abortion advocates have had good success in persuading the American public that the Supreme Court’s decision has put women’s lives at risk – and that only unfettered access to abortion will save them. But this is just not true.\n\nIn the 13 US states with abortion prohibitions in effect, every single one bans only elective abortions. Life-saving medical treatment for mothers who are facing grave medical complications during pregnancy are not elective. They are part of life-affirming care. As pro-life physicians and ethicists have explained, to protect these life-saving treatments, the most well-crafted state laws leave the question of whether the mother is at grave risk to doctors’ reasonable medical judgment – a flexible and well-known legal standard to which doctors, who often need to make swift judgments in emergencies, are already required to adhere in other areas of law.\n\nWe’re a country that for a half century has privileged elective abortion (which makes up the vast majority of abortions in the US) as the inhumane response to abysmal maternal mortality rates, subpar workplace accommodations, poor nutrition and overall health conditions, and inadequate familial support structures. These problems are due mainly to social and economic inequities. On all these fronts, the rich are doing fine. Decades of widespread abortion access protected by Roe did nothing to solve these problems. And political polarization around abortion, before Dobbs and since, has done nothing to help.\n\nWith pro-lifers since Dobbs playing Whac-A-Mole against misinformation, abortion advocates have become more and more radically pro-abortion, pushing for ill-named federal legislation that would deregulate fully the billion-dollar abortion industry and upend all gestational limits and common sense restrictions nationwide.\n\nWhereas strict red-state abortion laws at least tend to cohere with their residents’ views, a Democratic Congress would be in a position to pass this radical legislation which is favored by only a slim minority of the American public. A far better path forward would be for politicians to come together to work out real policies that would help American women and their families flourish. Is that really too much to ask?\n\nErika Bachiochi is a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the author of “The Rights of Women: Reclaiming a Lost Vision.”\n\nBria Peacock: I can’t help but think ‘What if?’\n\nBria Peacock Bria Peacock\n\nOne of my closest friends called me from the hospital bed. A few weeks before, she missed her period and started spotting.\n\nThe emotions following a positive pregnancy test vary, but her reaction was not unique to many women lately. Uncertain of her options, she found herself in a random clinic in Texas for “pregnancy confirmation” filled with intense fear – scared to say the wrong thing to the wrong person.\n\nWith a quick ultrasound, no pregnancy was seen, but her provider told her that she likely had a miscarriage and to follow up if necessary. The spotting continued. Then, the pain began and became excruciating and unwavering, as she boarded a plane to Las Vegas for a trip her partner had planned.\n\nAs the pain worsened, she was scared to ask for help, uncertain if it even existed. A few hours later, she collapsed in the hotel room and woke up in an emergency room surrounded by doctors and nurses explaining that she had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a belly full of blood and emergency surgery was needed to save her life.\n\nBeing on the receiving end of that phone call was a moment I will never forget. As an abortion provider, I dissected each step wondering how this could have been avoided. But the largest point is this: lives are at risk, especially those of Black and brown women.\n\nI am grateful the provider did not question the standard of care or their medical expertise, but I can’t help but think what if? What if she had a follow up ultrasound? What if she collapsed in Texas? What if the provider delayed surgery for an ethics discussion? Would she still be here? It is chilling that this is the reality for many people in this new America. I hope we can act quickly enough to save their lives, too.\n\nDr. Bria Peacock is a resident in obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTorrey DeVitto: I can’t imagine my life without my abortion\n\nTorrey DeVitto MARIO BARBERIO\n\nSeventeen years ago, I had to make one of the hardest decisions I have ever made. I was at the start of my career, while living alone, 3,000 miles away from any family members when I found out I was pregnant. I was overwhelmed and flooded with anxiety and emotions. I knew I wasn’t ready to be a mother. I knew I needed to build my career and fulfill my dreams before having a baby.\n\nIn that moment I chose to have an abortion. No matter what anyone else thinks or feels about my decision, it was mine and mine only to make. I made the choice that was best for me and my life. Having the right to decide what is best for our bodies is every person’s fundamental right. I can’t imagine what my life would be like today if I hadn’t been able to make that choice for myself.\n\nThat is why I am speaking loudly, sharing my experience and using my voice for all others out there, to ensure that our right to have complete say over our bodies does not get taken away.\n\nNow, this is inarguably a monumental time in history for women. After the Dobbs decision, I encourage everyone to look at this matter simply through the lens of protecting fundamental health care. I implore everyone to educate themselves to see how dangerous the future is for the health and wellness of female-identifying people everywhere.\n\nAlthough the subject at hand centers on abortion, this matter is also about access to safe birth control methods and medical procedures and treatments that can save our lives and preserve our health. Reproductive rights and reproductive health affect everyone.\n\nWe cannot go backward. Regardless of anyone’s personal beliefs, the basic human right to have complete control and dominion over our own bodies is mandatory for freedom to have meaning.\n\nWe need our voices to come together to stand up for what is right. November is coming, and women have a chance to be heard.\n\nTorrey DeVitto is an actress, philanthropist and activist.\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman: We can’t let this painful moment hold us back\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman Photo by The Blackhouse\n\nThis moment is incredibly painful for all of us, but the reality is that it has been building for well over a decade. Anti-abortion politicians used voter suppression and gerrymandering in their quest to consume and consolidate power while exploiting abortion access and trans justice to spread a White supremacist message. This has been a long time coming.\n\nThe modern anti-abortion movement grew out of the religious right’s effort to organize against school integration, secularism and busing of the late 1960s. When they could no longer use openly racist arguments, the 1973 Supreme Court decision provided an opening allowing them to divide the electorate along the same Jim Crow lines. The call for abortion bans became their dog whistle for politicians who fought tooth and nail to demonize immigrants, criminalize poor families and brutalize Black communities.\n\nThis moment is incredibly painful, and it’s a moment to rebuild and right the wrongs of the past. In order to rebuild abortion access, we must look at the root causes that got us here: anti-Black racism, misogyny and economic injustice.\n\nWe must create a nation in which everyone is able to access abortion care – and all health care – no matter who they are, how they identify or how much money they have in their pockets. We must call for the end of prosecuting people or putting them in jail for the outcomes of their pregnancies, for self-managing their abortions, or for parenting in poverty.\n\nOur nation’s budgets are examples of where we want to put our priorities. They must become moral documents that prioritize the health of pregnant people and those living in poverty over violence and policing.\n\nIt starts with us creating a culture in which everyone who is pregnant is treated with love, dignity and respect. We cannot rely on politicians’ vague and empty promises to fight back when the campaign is over. We have to ask how they plan to do it now and get involved in our communities to make that vision of reality possible.\n\nThis moment is incredibly painful, but it is the perfect moment for us to rebuild a vision of reproductive justice for the future.\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman is the founder and executive director of We Testify, an organization dedicated to the leadership and representation of people who have abortions and seeks to shift the way the public understands the context and complexity of accessing abortion care.\n\nKristan Hawkins: We’ve been preparing for years to be the first post-Roe generation\n\nKristan Hawkins Students for Life of America\n\nAnyone familiar with a section of the Alps called the Semmering knows the story of an impossible feat – a thread of tracks built impossibly high between Vienna and Venice before an engine existed with the force to pull a train from one place to another. That kind of vision has driven Students for Life of America, founded as a post-Roe organization, years before it seemed possible to many people that the Supreme Court’s wrong-headed decision in Roe would ever be gone.\n\nWhen I set out to help build what is now a nationwide network of more than 1,300 groups in all 50 states, I was unwavering in my belief that Roe would eventually be overturned – even as people told me privately it would never happen. But abortion was not written in invisible ink in the Constitution, and single-issue voters like my colleagues and me persevered through political wins and losses, fixed on the goal of seeing life protected both in law and in practice.\n\nOur plans included prioritizing support for women through our Standing with You campaign, in providing community and assistance through our groups, in training more than 150,000 students turned pro-life activists and in establishing an organization capable of more direct policy engagement with the intent of protecting life in law. Our legislative priorities focus on an early abortion model, as more than 9 out of 10 abortions take place by 12 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Real abortion limits save real lives.\n\nBut getting where we want to go won’t be quick. The day after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, we did not elect a Black president. The day after the 19th Amendment was ratified giving women the right to vote, we didn’t have a woman Speaker of the House. And the day after Roe fell, our work in defending the innocent wasn’t finished.\n\nWe’re battling 50-year-old talking points and assumptions to reopen conversations. We’re not running away from that. We plan to have one million conversations this year alone – many of which have already started and are focused on engaging younger voters whose voices need to be heard – because you can’t build new law and new services without new consensus. And we need new consensus that rejects Roe’s outdated and prejudiced legacy.\n\nWe’re not afraid to speak up – though we have good reason to fear. Our team faces threats but is resolved nonetheless to present a message of hope for the future.\n\nThe view of the Alps on that impossible ride is spectacular. I got a glimpse of that kind of miraculous sight outside the Supreme Court when we learned Roe was gone. We still have a tough climb, but nothing will stop our resolve to protect the humanity of people born and preborn.\n\nKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action with more than 1,300 groups on educational campuses in all 50 states.

The right to choose when and how we create a family has – for so many women – been one of the last strongholds of agency we maintained in an economy that can be deeply disempowering. Women’s work is still devalued and earns less than men for the same work, women are still tracked into poverty-wage work more than men and women still hold the vast majority of family caregiving responsibilities. But until June of this year, we at least had the freedom to decide – for ourselves – when and whether to have a family at all.\n\nSo when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority took this away, women – especially working class women – now have everything to win. Inequality creates impossible choices for women at the bottom of the economy – between work, caring for family members and our own health. Before the pandemic, two-thirds of all minimum wage jobs were held by women, and most of those jobs lacked any paid leave or sick days, access to health insurance, or other basic benefits. We thought the pandemic was the final breaking point, laying bare for the world to see the systemic failure to adequately support the caregiving needs of families – from child care to paid leave to home and community based care for older people and people with disabilities.\n\nBut with the Dobbs decision, what was once a crisis of impossible choices between earning an income and caring for family has now become no choice at all.\n\nWith multiple states banning abortion, a number of them without exception in case of rape or incest, women are being forced into family, a responsibility the US economic model has never supported. We are one of only a few developed nations without a single week of federally mandated paid family medical leave. We don’t have universal child care or long-term care. Instead, we largely rely upon the labor and sacrifices of unpaid women in our families or underpaid women care workers (majority women of color) whose own families pay the price. Child care centers are closing down for lack of a sustainable workforce or funding model. And over 800,000 eligible families are languishing on waiting lists for access to home and community based services due to lack of funding to sustain the infrastructure or workforce to meet the need.\n\nNot a single Republican supported child care, child tax credits, paid family and medical leave or home and community based care for older adults or people with disabilities when it was on the table in the Build Back Better Act that passed in the House of Representatives. Instead, they are focused on taking away the choice that has been sacred to women across the country and across party lines, leaving us no choice but to show up and vote them out.\n\nThis is a severe miscalculation for Republicans. We will organize and build our power – our sisters, mothers, aunts, grandmothers – for ourselves but also for future generations. We have no choice but to win, because we have everything to win now.\n\nAi-jen Poo is senior advisor to Care in Action, a nonprofit group dedicated to fighting for dignity and fairness for domestic workers.\n\nSarah Eagle Heart: Indigenous women are facing another layer of hardship\n\nSarah Eagle Heart Return to the Heart Foundation\n\nIndigenous women are facing the ultimate crisis. We face poverty, violence and murder at frightening rates. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to add another layer of hardship and jurisdiction to our lives by overturning Roe v. Wade is troubling.\n\nAn Indigenous woman’s health and well-being are sacred.\n\nIn many Indigenous traditions, a woman facing decisions about her pregnancy was guided through her decision by elders and midwives. Indigenous women had access to traditional medicines and knowledge for safe abortions before western medicine came to this shore. Our ancestors knew what was best for their families. Just as their decisions were respected long ago, we are obligated to respect those decisions now. Indigenous women have always had the ultimate authority to make that decision for their families.\n\nWhile many of these teachings have been erased with colonialism, it is critical that we continue to fight and honor bodily sovereignty.\n\nSarah Eagle Heart is the co-founder and senior adviser to the Return to the Heart Foundation and the co-author of “WARRIOR PRINCESSES STRIKE BACK: How Lakota Twins Fight Oppression and Heal through Connectedness.”\n\nGretchen Whitmer: We’re fighting like hell\n\nGretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, we saw legitimate fear, but more importantly, a powerful resolve from women and families across Michigan. When the news broke here, many were stunned. They couldn’t believe that the Supreme Court took this action. But perhaps more importantly, they were horrified to learn that extreme politicians were reacting by doubling down on efforts to ban abortion without exceptions for rape or incest and put doctors and nurses in jail for doing their jobs.\n\nThose politicians haven’t been successful, thanks to our work in the courts to protect abortion. Historic numbers of Michiganders on both sides of the aisle have pushed for abortion to remain legal through an upcoming ballot initiative. Fear quickly turned into resolve, and we’re fighting like hell.\n\nThe bottom line is that without access to abortion, women’s health and futures will be put at risk. Women experience ectopic pregnancies, cancer, miscarriage, financial hardship and more. It is not a politician’s job to make our medically complicated decisions for us. However we personally feel about abortion, a woman must be able to make her own health care decisions with her doctor. It’s the job of politicians to protect women, not put them in harm’s way as abortion bans do.\n\nThis November, reproductive freedom is on the ballot – and voters are in charge.\n\nWe face a stark choice between candidates and public officials who will restore and protect access to reproductive health care – and extremists who will do everything in their power to ban abortion with no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother, deny women health care, and punish doctors and nurses for doing their jobs. As Michigan governor, I filed a lawsuit with Michigan’s Supreme Court asking them to protect the right to an abortion. I also instructed State of Michigan departments to find opportunities to increase protections for reproductive health care, including contraception. I called on Congress to enshrine Roe’s protections into federal law. State legislators across the country, who are also up for reelection, make policies and pass legislation on reproductive health care that affect people on the ground in their states. These races and these votes matter.\n\nThe Dobbs decision stripped millions of women of their right to make the biggest decision anyone can make. Every American who believes in a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions – whether Republican, Democrat or Independent – must stand up and make their voices heard. We must come together to restore and protect reproductive freedoms and access to safe, legal abortion care.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, is the governor of Michigan.\n\nMónica Ramírez: What a post-Roe world means for the women I fight for\n\nMónica Ramírez Justice for Migrant Women\n\nAny time a monumental decision stands to impact the rights of millions of people across our country, I think about how these decisions might be even more devastating and consequential for the most marginalized in our communities.\n\nThe situation involving a Latina in a border town in Starr County, Texas, who was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly committing “self-induced abortion” in April (though the charges were later dropped) foreshadowed what might happen across the country if the Dobbs decision struck down Roe v. Wade.\n\nMonths later, after the Dobbs ruling, people across the nation heard about a 10-year-old girl from my home state of Ohio, a child rape victim who was forced to go to Indiana to seek care because abortion had been banned in Ohio. These are just two examples of what many feared was possible in a post-Roe America.\n\nPeople must understand that the migrant women I serve have multiple identities. They are rural, immigrants, survivors, essential workers and much more. Each of these identities carries its own challenges when it comes to health care in this nation.\n\nThe failure of the Supreme Court to uphold one’s constitutional right to abortion poses yet another barrier. This decision and the devastating ripple effect that it will have creates additional threats to their human and civil rights, including the ability to live and work with dignity.\n\nAs we consider the upcoming elections, we must ask ourselves who is truly fighting for our freedom to make choices about our bodies and who is genuinely committed to making sure that health care, including reproductive health care, is not only limited to the privileged among us.\n\nMónica Ramírez is the founder of Justice for Migrant Women, an organization dedicated to protecting and promoting the rights of migrant women through education, public awareness and advocacy.\n\nReshma Saujani: Abortion is also about parents’ rights\n\nReshma Saujani Adrian Kinloch\n\nAsk almost any mom, and they’ll tell you they support abortion access in some form. They also support other policies that ensure autonomy for women and better lives for American families: equal pay, affordable childcare and paid family leave. They want abortion rights and these other measures because they want options for themselves, their families and others to make choices for themselves about if, when and how to create a family.\n\nAnd it’s not just Democratic parents. Research from my organization, Marshall Plan for Moms, shows that a majority of mothers – including those who identify as conservative – are in favor of paid leave and other family-friendly policies. And multiple polls indicate that a majority of Americans support abortion rights; research also shows that those most likely to seek abortions are already mothers themselves.\n\nIn other words, parents (and most voters, really) want what Democrats – and only Democrats – are offering: legitimate plans to protect abortion access, improve maternal health care outcomes, resolve the childcare crisis and get women back to work after years of pandemic-exacerbated crisis.\n\nRather than propose solutions of their own, Republicans manufacture bad-faith culture wars. In multiple states, they have pursued draconian book bans and other efforts to curtail parents’ rights for their kids to learn fully at school. (They also oppose gun control legislation that could help those kids come home safe.)\n\nDuring an ongoing nationwide formula shortage just as the Dobbs decision was released, Republicans chose to focus their attention on bullying trans student athletes, all the while blocking breastfeeding protections for working mothers. They then introduced an abortion ban that would force women to give birth across the country – a ban that even Republican leadership noted was ill-timed and divisive – without, of course, making any commitment not to try to pass this measure after the midterms.\n\nIt’s on Democrats to shut down the culture war debates designed to distract and divide us, and instead focus our collective, righteous fury toward causes that actually matter. Even more importantly, it’s critical that they fight for the rights us moms really deserve, including abortion.\n\nReshma Saujani is founder and CEO of Marshall Plan for Moms and founder of Girls Who Code.\n\nFranchetta Groves: It’s time to step up for women\n\nFranchetta Groves Courtesy of Franchetta Groves\n\nBy overturning Roe v.

Ted Cruz believes the US Supreme Court was “clearly wrong” in its landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, the Texas Republican said Saturday.\n\n“Obergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation’s history,” Cruz said in a clip posted on his YouTube channel for his podcast. “Marriage was always an issue that was left to the states. We saw states before Obergefell, some states were moving to allow gay marriage, other states were moving to allow civil partnerships. There were different standards that the states were adopting.”\n\nHe added: “The way the Constitution set up for you to advance that position is to convince your fellow citizens, and if you succeeded in convincing your fellow citizens, then your state would change the laws to reflect those views. In Obergefell, the court said, ‘No, we know better than you guys do, and now every state must, must sanction and permit gay marriage.’”\n\n“I think that decision was clearly wrong when it was decided,” Cruz continued. ‘It was the court overreaching.”\n\nCruz, however, is not in favor of overturning Obergefell, saying that to do so would disrupt marriages nationwide, and he also doesn’t believe there’s necessary political interest in revisiting the ruling.\n\n“You’ve got a ton of people who have entered into gay marriages and it would be more than a little chaotic for the court to do something that somehow disrupted those marriages that have been entered into in accordance with the law,” Cruz said. “I think that would be a factor that would, would counsel restraint, that the court would be concerned about. But to be honest, I don’t think this court has any appetite for overturning any of these decisions.”\n\nHis remarks come weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ruling there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nCruz, a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage who believes the issue should be left to the states, echoed views expressed by many conservatives, including Justice Clarence Thomas, that the Supreme Court should revisit past rulings such as Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nIn a separate opinion on last month’s abortion decision, Thomas explicitly called for the court to reconsider its earlier rulings striking down state restrictions on contraceptives, state sodomy bans and state prohibitions on same-sex marriage.\n\n“Because any substantive due process decision is ‘demonstrably erroneous,’” Thomas wrote, “we have a duty to ‘correct the error’ established in those precedents.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from Cruz.", "authors": ["Daniella Diaz"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/23/politics/arizona-abortion-ban-ruling/index.html", "title": "Arizona judge rules state can enforce near-total abortion ban | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn Arizona Superior Court judge ruled Friday that a 1901 ban on nearly all abortions in that state can be enforced, a decision that is likely to see an appeal and is all but certain to galvanize female voters to turn out in greater numbers in the state’s closely contested US Senate and governor’s races.\n\nIn ruling that Arizona’s near-total ban on abortion could take effect, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson granted a request by the state’s Republican attorney general to lift a court injunction that had barred enforcement of Arizona’s pre-statehood ban on abortion after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973.\n\n“The court finds that because the legal basis for the judgment entered in 1973 has now been overruled, it must vacate the judgment in its entirety,” Johnson wrote in the ruling released Friday.\n\nThe case has thrust the issue of how restrictive abortion law should be in Arizona, a swing state that President Joe Biden carried by fewer than 11,000 votes. It’s a controversial topic that has divided Republicans in Arizona and is reflective of a pitched debate nationwide in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in late June, with many GOP-led states passing increasingly restrictive measures that run the risk of alienating moderate voters.\n\nThe judge’s ruling effectively outlaws all abortions in Arizona except when the procedure is necessary to save the mother’s life. The decision came a day before a 15-week ban on abortion was slated to go into effect in Arizona. That law was passed by Arizona lawmakers before the US Supreme Court decision.\n\nConservative Arizona lawmakers included language in the bill banning abortion after 15 weeks stating that the new legislation would not override the 1901 law – which was passed before Arizona became a state and can be traced back to as early as 1864. In addition to barring abortion in all cases except when “it is necessary to save (the mother’s) life,” the pre-statehood law carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers.\n\nWhile fighting the attorney general’s move to allow the 1901 abortion ban to be enforced, abortion rights groups had argued that if both laws were to go into effect, it would create significant confusion for both abortion providers and women seeking care. But the judge said in her ruling that she was not weighing in on how the conflict between Arizona’s abortion laws would be settled.\n\n“While there may be legal questions the parties seek to resolve regarding Arizona statutes on abortion, those questions are not for this Court to decide here,” Johnson wrote in the decision.\n\nThe ruling drew a swift rebuke from several Democratic groups that favor abortion rights and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Katie Hobbs, who said she was “outraged and devastated” by the decision.\n\n“There’s no doubt in my mind that this draconian 1901 law will have dire consequences on the health and well-being of Arizona women and their families,” Hobbs said in a statement. “This cruel law effectively outlaws abortion in Arizona — with no exceptions for rape or incest — and risks women’s fundamental freedom to make their own health care decisions. … To make matters worse, this law mandates jail time for abortion providers. Medical professionals will now be forced to think twice and call their lawyer before providing patients with oftentimes necessary, lifesaving care.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre criticized the Arizona court ruling as “catastrophic, dangerous and unacceptable.”\n\n“Make no mistake: this backwards decision exemplifies the disturbing trend across the country of Republican officials at the local and national level dead-set on stripping women of their rights, including through (South Carolina Sen. Lindsey) Graham’s proposed national abortion ban,” she said in a statement.\n\nArizona GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who led the legal process to try to get the state’s pre-statehood ban on abortion put back into effect after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, tweeted that he was pleased by the decision:\n\n“We applaud the court for upholding the will of the legislature and providing clarity and uniformity on this important issue. I have and will continue to protect the most vulnerable Arizonans,” he tweeted.\n\nThe disagreement over Arizona’s abortion laws has created a confusing legal landscape in Arizona for much of the summer that has unfolded against the backdrop of a shifting national political mood ahead of November’s midterm elections. While both historical trends and the nation’s sour mood about inflation had initially appeared to favor Republicans in their quest to take control of the US House and Senate this November, the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion has energized female voters all over the country – a dynamic that led to the surprising victory for proponents of abortion rights in Kansas and better-than-expected performances for Democrats in special elections for the US House since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe ruling injects a new uncertainty into the marquee statewide races. Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the Senate, are trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly as he runs for a full six-year term. And Democrats are trying to flip the governor’s mansion, currently held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nIn the Arizona governor’s race, Hobbs has portrayed GOP opponent Kari Lake as “extreme” on abortion. Lake has repeatedly said she is opposed to the procedure and in an August news conference said that she would “uphold the laws that are on the books.” But she did not specify which laws she meant. “If people don’t like the laws on the books, then they need to elect representatives who will change the laws. I’m running for governor, not for God. So I don’t get to write the laws,” she said.\n\nHer campaign has not responded to CNN’s requests for clarification on her view of the pre-statehood law.\n\nBoth Lake and GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters, who is challenging Kelly, have argued that their Democratic opponents have adopted positions that are too far out of the mainstream in favor of abortion rights.\n\nMasters removed language from his campaign website expressing support for a “federal personhood law” and other conservative anti-abortion stances after winning the GOP nomination last month. His campaign told CNN that Masters does support Graham’s proposal for a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks, which would provide exceptions to protect the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest.\n\nBut before the ruling, Masters’ campaign did not respond to questions about his position on the pre-statehood law or the court case to enforce it.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Kelly said the decision would “have a devastating impact on the freedom Arizona women have had for decades: to choose an abortion if they need one. Let’s be clear, this is exactly what Blake Masters wants, to completely ban abortions in Arizona and across the country – without even an exception for rape or incest. I will never stop fighting to restore these rights for Arizona women.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America fought Brnovich’s move in Pima County Superior Court – the court that handled the 1973 injunction.\n\nThe group’s lawyers had argued that the court had a duty to “harmonize all of the Arizona Legislature’s enactments as they exist today.” In the post-Dobbs era, the group argued that the pre-statehood law could “be enforceable in some respects” but that it should not apply to abortions provided by licensed physicians – and instead that the ban should apply to anyone other than a licensed physician who attempts to provide abortion services.\n\nIn a statement, Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona, said Friday’s ruling “has the practical and deplorable result of sending Arizonans back nearly 150 years. No archaic law should dictate our reproductive freedom and how we live our lives today.”\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from the White House on Saturday.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}]}

We've been clear to the Russians that we would respond to that,\" Finer said Monday.\n\nPolicy reversal\n\nThe Biden administration has so far barred Ukraine from using the missiles to strike deep into Russian territory.\n\nIts hesitation stemmed from fears that allowing Ukraine to carry out the strikes would involve the U.S. more directly in the conflict and provoke a harsh response from Putin, who has long threatened to deploy nuclear weapons in the conflict.\n\nThe Ukrainian military needs Pentagon assistance to launch ATACMS at their longest range. Putin has said that would amount to direct U.S. involvement in the war.\n\nMore:Why long-range missiles could be either a silver bullet or a powder keg for Ukraine-Russia war\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that if the missiles are used to strike targets \"deep\" inside Russia, then it could lead to a sea change in relations with the West, state media reported.\n\nIn September, amid mounting speculation the U.S. was mulling a policy change, Putin said it would constitute the \"direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThis would, Putin cautioned, drastically alter the nature of the conflict, and Russia would be forced to take \"appropriate measures\" in response. Putin did not specify what those measures would be.\n\nIn October, Putin changed Russia's nuclear doctrine, saying Russia's defense ministry would offer a \"range of responses\" if NATO policies on long-range strikes changed.\n\nWhat the conflict abroad means for Americans: Sign up for USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine crisis newsletter.\n\nWhat are ATACMS?\n\nATACMS − Army Tactical Missile Systems – are Lockheed Martin-manufactured missiles with a range of up to 190 miles. In July, the Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $226 million contract to produce the missile systems.\n\nATACMS are already in the hands of Ukraine's military, which the U.S. has allowed to strike targets inside Russia close to the border.\n\nATACMS \"are incredibly costly,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"They are in limited supply, so we're not going to dip below our own readiness levels,\" she added.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nMilitary experts and officials say Ukraine's use of the powerful long-range U.S. weapons may enable Kyiv to damage military targets including supply lines, and troop and weapons systems far from its border. It is not clear whether Ukraine's use of ATCAMS would fundamentally alter the course of the war.\n\n\"A decision of some importance has been made, but we are still a long way from knowing just how important it will be,\" Phillips O'Brien, an American military historian at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, wrote in his Ukraine-focused newsletter Sunday night.\n\nUkraine could use the missiles to hit Russian bases farther from the Ukrainian border that Russia relies on to launch airstrikes and ground attacks. Up to now, Ukraine has lacked the tools to strike those bases, Fred Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the critical threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n“The more that the Ukrainians are able to strike these perfectly legitimate military targets that the Russians are using to attack Ukraine, the more countermeasures the Russians have to take that reduce the effectiveness of Russian military action,” he said.\n\nKagan cited a Ukrainian strike on a Russian arsenal around 240 miles from the border in September that demolished several months' worth of ammunition.\n\nSingh said long-range missiles likely would not be able to reach specific Russian airfields. \"They have moved those out of the ATACMS range, so that wouldn't have an impact,\" she said.\n\nAllowing the strikes could \"really matter\" if it signals the start of a \"general expansion of targeting, allowing the Ukrainians to hit many military targets in Russia,\" O'Brien said.\n\nO'Brien added Biden's move would be a \"damp squib, short-term decision\" if Kyiv is only permitted to strike targets \"just around Kursk\" – a region Ukraine occupied over the summer – has a limited supply of ATACMS and President-elect Donald Trump eventually reverses course.\n\n\"It will help now around Kursk, but that’s about it,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said being able to carry out the long-range strikes wouldn't meaningfully improve Ukraine's position in the war.\n\nSupplies of ATACMS are limited, and there are not many targets they could hit, she said. \"Ukraine's problem right now isn't lack of weapons or type of weapons, it's manpower, and Russia just has so many more people, even putting aside the North Korean forces,\" she said.\n\nDoes the move send a message to Trump?\n\nThe move by the Biden administration comes weeks after Trump's sweeping election victory. Trump has signaled he would cut or eliminate U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. still has $9 billion in approved aid to Ukraine, which it has promised to deliver by Jan. 20, when Trump takes office.\n\n\"President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,\" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" last week.\n\nAllowing long-range strikes in Russia could have a political impact in the U.S., according to Matthew Savill, military sciences director at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\n\"The Ukrainians need to convince the incoming U.S. administration that they are still worth backing,\" he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nKavanagh said Ukraine launching long-range strikes into Russia in the two months before Trump is inaugurated could provoke Putin to intensify his assault on Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin has an incentive to try to increase his leverage and his bargaining position as much as possible,\" she said. \"He has no incentive to be restrained in his actions towards Ukraine.\"\n\nPressure increases on European allies\n\nThe decision could put pressure on the U.K. and France to take down their own restrictions on Ukraine using air-launched cruise missiles they have provided for long-range strikes.\n\nThe U.K. has provided Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles, while France has given Ukraine SCALP missiles. They can't reach as far as ATACMS – the range of both is around 155 miles.\n\nAlthough neither country has officially announced a policy change, both have said allowing long-range strikes is on the table.\n\n\"We openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory,\" Jean-Noel Barrot, France's foreign minister, told reporters ahead of a European Union meeting in Brussels.\n\nOther European leaders and U.S. allies chimed in with support for the decision.\n\n\"This decision was very necessary... Russia sees that Ukraine enjoys strong support and that the West's position is unyielding and determined,\" Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Monday. \"It's a very important, potentially decisive moment in this war.\"\n\nGermany holds back missiles\n\nThe decision has caused European allies of the U.S. to chafe at Germany, which said months ago it would not allow Ukraine to use German long-range Taurus missiles.\n\nOn Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Putin for the first time in almost two years, ending Putin's isolation from talks with European leaders and provoking jabs from other NATO leaders.\n\nScholz said he called on Putin to withdraw Russian troops and negotiate with Zelenskyy.\n\nMore:Biden in the background at G20 Summit as leaders brace for second go-round with Trump\n\nBut Zelenskyy slammed the call as opening a \"Pandora's box\" by stymieing Europe's efforts to isolate Putin. \"This is exactly what Putin has long sought. It is critical for him to weaken his isolation, as well as Russia's isolation, and to hold mere talks that will lead nowhere,\" he said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe Kremlin suggested Germany made the diplomatic gesture to pursue an energy deal with Russia. Before the war began, around a third of German oil and gas imports came from Russia, and Europe's efforts to cut off Russia economically have taken a toll on Germany.\n\nState of the war in Ukraine\n\nNearly three years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has achieved a full-on military breakthrough. Russia still occupies almost 20% of Ukraine and an estimated 3.5 million Ukrainians live under Russian occupation.\n\nFor the last year, Russia has appeared to hold the initiative in southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Mykola Bielieskov, a military research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv. Russia's military has meanwhile continued to target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure with massive missile and drone attacks. These attacks have hit apartment buildings, schools and energy facilities.\n\nMoscow also holds the upper hand in terms of military recruits, though the fact that it's had to persuade North Korea to provide additional forces and weaponry may signal that it is both running out of personnel and supplies and it's not willing to risk, for political reasons, another general mobilization within Russia, where the war is not popular.\n\nBritain's Ministry of Defense previously reported that about 1,200 Russian troops were dying every day in September, a record casualty rate since the start of Moscow's invasion in February 2021.\n\nFor Ukraine, the past four months were the deadliest of the war so far, and more people died in September than any other month this year, with 208 people killed and 1,220 injured, according to Humanity & Inclusion. That month, 45% of those killed were over the age of 60.\n\nThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted in a Nov. 16 assessment that Ukraine's use of drones has played a role in \"constraining Russian mechanized maneuver and preventing Russian forces from fully exploiting Ukraine's ongoing manpower constraints.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/russia-ukraine-prison-attack/index.html", "title": "White House says Russia is planning to falsify evidence to frame ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nUS officials believe Russia is preparing to falsify evidence to blame Ukrainian forces for last week’s deadly blast at the Olenivka prison ahead of visits to the site by outside parties.\n\nAn administration official told CNN they expect Russia will falsify evidence, blame Ukrainian forces, and even have “reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS were to blame before journalists arrive.”\n\nJohn Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, confirmed that reporting Thursday.\n\n“We anticipate that Russian officials will try to frame the Ukrainian Armed Forces in anticipation of journalists and potential investigators visiting the site of the attack,” Kirby said. “In fact, we’ve already seen some spurious press reports to this effect, where they have planted evidence. We have reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS – the high mobility advanced rocket systems that have been so much in the news lately – were to blame.”\n\n“And to do that before journalists arrived on site, and again, we’re beginning to even start to see some press reporting to that effect,” Kirby told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond when asked for further information on the reported plan to falsify evidence.\n\nThe US supplied Ukraine with the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system earlier this year. The US believes Russia has collected large quantities of HIMARS fragments from strikes against its positions in Ukraine and is likely to deliberately place them at sites such as the prison to claim Ukraine was responsible, according to an administration official familiar with the latest information.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday the attack on the prison in separatist-held eastern Ukraine, which resulted in the deaths of at least 50 prisoners, was “a deliberate war crime by the Russians.” Russia, meanwhile, blamed Ukraine for the attack.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday reiterated the Russian claim that the Ukrainian military was responsible for the attack.\n\n“There is evidence here and there is nothing to hide here,” he told CNN. “Moreover, you know that the Russian side proposed to the UN and invited the Red Cross to get acquainted with this evidence on the spot, to conduct the necessary exhaustive investigation.”\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed Wednesday it had been able to visit the Olenivka facility only once – in May this year to deliver water tanks. “But we did not have access to POWs held there on an individual basis – as per ICRC’s modalities of work in detention facilities – and that continues to be the case,” it said.\n\nThe ICRC added: “Under the Third Geneva Convention, during international armed conflicts, the ICRC must be granted access to all PoWs, wherever they are held. We also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit. Since February 2022, our teams have been able to have access to some PoWs, but not all.”\n\nThe ICRC says it has requested access to the detention center again since the attack last week, but has not received permission from the Russians.\n\nThe Olenivka prison near Donetsk has been used to house many of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol several months ago. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of either side.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a Wednesday news conference that the UN is seeking to establish a fact-finding team to study the attack following requests from both Russia and Ukraine to investigate. He added that the terms of reference for the panel would need to be accepted by Russia and Ukraine before the fact-finding mission would begin.\n\nVideo aired on Russian networks and shared on social media channels in Donetsk show extensive destruction to a building and several bodies. CNN was able to geolocate footage of the strike to an industrial area about two miles outside the frontline town of Olenivka.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said the explosion took place on the territory of the industrial zone, in a newly-constructed building specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into the strike. In a statement, it said pretrial preliminary data shows “the occupying state struck the territory of penal colony No. 120 in the temporarily occupied Olenivka village of Volnovakha district of Donetsk region.”\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk are the two regions that together form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014.\n\nThe area has become the centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year.\n\nThe Russian military has kept up a persistent barrage of artillery and missile strikes across the region for several weeks. The Kremlin says the goal of what it calls its “special military operation” is to take control of both Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Paul Leblanc", "Kaitlan Collins", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/biden-congress-soviet-made-weapons-ukraine/index.html", "title": "White House under pressure from Congress and Zelensky to find ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nNearly three weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is still assessing the most effective way to get military aid into the country without triggering a wider war.\n\nWhile administration officials say the effort to provide Ukrainian forces with American-made weapons such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles has been largely successful, the White House is under intense pressure to do more.\n\nSpecifically, both Congress and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have pressured Biden officials to help broker the transfer of heavier Soviet-made weaponry to Ukraine, including MiG fighter jets and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. It’s a message that Zelensky could echo on Wednesday when he addresses Congress.\n\nBut so far the Biden administration has not helped provide those heavier, Soviet-made weapons systems. US officials continue to grapple with concerns about how Russia might respond if certain weapons transfers are approved. Officials have also raised questions about how useful MiG fighters would be, and whether they are worth the risk.\n\nThe State Department has been working to identify which countries currently have the Soviet-made S-300 air defense systems and is examining how they could be transferred to Ukraine, sources said. But it remains unclear how the US would backfill those countries’ supplies of surface-to-air missiles, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nA similar problem arose last week, when Poland indicated it would be willing to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the US telling Poland it would be unable to backfill the jets quickly.\n\nBut a Republican Senate aide told CNN on Monday that Congress had solved that problem for the White House when it passed a long-delayed $1.5 trillion spending bill last week. That package included more than $13 billion in money to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including funding to directly backfill allies and partners who have delivered weapons to Ukraine from their own stocks.\n\n“That’s where we should urge the administration to work with allies and partners, not just in Europe but potentially around the globe, who are in a position to deliver more munitions for things like the S-300 or other advanced air defense systems that we can work with to backfill their own capabilities,” the aide added.\n\nTop House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to the State and Defense departments on Tuesday calling on the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with Soviet-made air defense systems and fighter jets.\n\nThe lawmakers said that the new funding Congress approved in an emergency supplemental should be used to deliver the military aid to the Ukrainians and help reimburse US allies who have also provided equipment and depleted their own stocks.\n\nLack of visibility\n\nAlmost all of the $350 million in weapons the Biden administration approved for Ukraine in late February have been delivered, according to multiple sources familiar with the status of the arms shipments. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved an additional $200 million military aid package for Ukraine, which includes more Javelin and Stinger missiles, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSmoke rises from a Russian tank destroyed by the Ukrainian forces on the side of a road in Lugansk region on February 26, 2022. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nUS officials have told Congress that the weapons they are sending to Ukraine are getting where they are supposed to go, according to sources familiar with the matter. But two sources tell CNN that the NATO alliance has very little idea what percentage of the military assistance is actually getting into the hands of Ukrainian forces after it crosses NATO and European territory.\n\nNATO doesn’t know because, deliberately, these shipments are being arranged by countries bilaterally – directly with Ukraine – and not through the alliance, the sources said. Nations have been told not to discuss with one another what they are sending and how.\n\nThis is partly for security reasons, because Western officials don’t want Russians to target the convoys, and informing the 30-country bloc of the transit points would increase the risk of such information leaking. But it also allows NATO to credibly say that as a bloc, it is not providing lethal assistance to Ukraine.\n\nWeekend strike\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Striking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are dead 01:01 - Source: CNN\n\nFunneling weapons into Ukraine may also prove to be more complicated going forward as the Kremlin made clear over the weekend that Russian forces will now target US shipments flowing into the country.\n\nThat warning, coupled with Russia’s recent strike on a military base in western Ukraine, is raising concerns about Moscow’s willingness to target aid shipments crossing the border from neighboring countries. NATO still does not believe, however, that Russia would target shipments still inside NATO or European Union member countries.\n\nTargeting arms shipments would be difficult for Russia, a source familiar with the intelligence added. It would need exact information on when and where the shipments are entering the country – and have to cope with the added challenge that many are likely being transported under cover of darkness.\n\nStill, the strike appeared to be part of a messaging campaign by Russia, the source said, warning the West against continuing its military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the base was not being used as a transit point for shipments of weapons and US efforts to provide security assistance were not disrupted. But a second NATO source told CNN that the strike was concerning to the bloc, due to its proximity to Western countries that are sending materials into Ukraine.\n\nWith the latest strike “it certainly appears as if the Russians are broadening their target set,” Kirby added, noting the weekend attack is just the latest sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only sending a message about shipments of weapons into the country but also that he “clearly has the occupation of Ukraine in mind.”\n\nAs a result, the Biden administration now faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ways to expedite weapons shipments to Ukraine and address another concerted push by lawmakers to provide additional defense capabilities, including the S-300.\n\nPressure from the Hill\n\nIn the meantime, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are urging the Biden administration to step up its efforts to deliver more weapons to Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, told CNN he got an earful from Ukrainian American constituents this past weekend over the Biden administration’s decision to oppose providing Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine.\n\n“I went to a rally yesterday where that was the number one issue with the Ukrainian Americans, to give back the skies to the people of Ukraine and stop it,” Durbin said. “And I had to think in the context, as President Biden said in Philadelphia and said to us here in Washington, he doesn’t want to risk world war III. It’s a terrible, terrible decision that he faces, but I’m going to stand by him and work with him to do the right thing.”\n\nOne lawmaker said the public attention in Congress pushing for the Polish MiG-29 jets has been misplaced, arguing that Ukraine already has planes it isn’t flying, it doesn’t have enough pilots to fly more planes and the country’s runways have been damaged by Russian attacks.\n\n“The controversy over the MiGs is a classic case of Congress focusing on the shiny object instead of what will actually matter,” the lawmaker said. “The things that will really matter are the S-300s, SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) and drones. DoD is looking at ways to get them from allies, since we don’t have any we can give directly.”\n\nSenators have been publicly pushing for the Biden administration to change course on the Polish fighter jets since the opposition was announced last week. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who was in Poland on Sunday on a congressional trip just miles from the Ukrainian border, pushed back on the notion that the MiG-29 fighters would cause an escalation with Russia during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“I don’t know why that would be true,” Portman said. “You know, the Russians have complained about everything. Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes.”\n\nPressure is mounting for the Biden administraion to find a way to provide Ukraine with S-300 air defense systems Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said the plan to provide Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets “would not be effective.”\n\n“They already have approximately 30 aircraft. They have problems with maintaining and flying those aircraft,” Reed said. “The real advantage would be to move in air defense missiles, which I hope they will do, because particularly some of the older ones, Soviet-era, they understand how to use them, since they’ve trained on them.”\n\nOperational security concerns\n\nThe source familiar with the intelligence also told CNN that providing MiG fighter jets does not make a lot of operational sense. The aircraft present a big target and they are hard to move, which creates a myriad of logistical, operational and security problems.\n\nThere are also operational security concerns around disclosing details about shipments of weapons to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, who told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon is being very “careful and cautious about talking about this.”\n\n“We haven’t put out specifics on the inventory. There are certain systems we still have not acknowledged … that they’re getting. We don’t give out numbers, we don’t give out timing of the shipments, we don’t provide context on the locations or the ground routes on which it’s arriving, because we want to keep that security assistance flowing as much and as fast as it can to assist them in the fight,” the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Natasha Bertrand Jeremy Herb Katie Bo Williams", "Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand", "Jeremy Herb", "Katie Bo Williams"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/world/kyiv-strikes-russia-zelensky-peace-intl/index.html", "title": "Wave of Russian missiles hit Ukraine after Zelensky outlines ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia launched its biggest wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in more than a month on Tuesday – hours after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky proposed a peace plan in front of world leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded out across Ukraine shortly after its leader outlined a 10-point plan including the withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.\n\nThe strikes targeted power infrastructure in several regions of the country, leaving more than seven million Ukrainians without power and the supply of electricity in a critical condition, according to senior Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe deputy head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said that 15 facilities of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure had been damaged during the Russian missile strikes, but Ukrainian air defenses had shot down 70 of more than 90 missiles fired at Ukraine.\n\nTwo missiles or rockets also reportedly hit a farm in Poland near the border with Ukraine, killing two people, according to Polish media. It is unclear where the projectiles came from, but they landed roughly the same time as a Russian missile attack on western Ukraine.\n\nTwo projectiles reportedly hit Poland around the same time as the Russian onslaught in Ukraine, with Polish media showing an image of a deep impact and upturned farm vehicle at the site, near the town of Przewodow.\n\nA government spokesman said that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defense Affairs.\n\nPoland is a NATO member state, and the defense alliance is looking into the matter, a NATO official told CNN.\n\nFellow NATO members the United States and the United Kingdom remained circumspect in their statements about the incident.\n\nA senior White House official said they do not have confirmation of any rocket or missile strike in Poland, but that US officials are currently working to try and figure out exactly what has happened.\n\nZelensky in contrast blamed Russia for incident, which was echoed by NATO member Latvia. “The terror is not limited to our national borders,” Zelensky said in his daily address.\n\nAmid speculation over the projectiles’ origin, Russia’s Defense Ministry denied responsibility, saying there were “no strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border.” Polish authorities also have not confirmed that Russian missiles landed in their territory.\n\nPower supplies disrupted in Ukraine\n\nAt least a dozen cities and districts in Ukraine were targeted by Rusisan strikes, according to a CNN analysis of the missile strikes. The wave of strikes appears to be the largest since October 10, when Russia stepped up its campaign to destroy electricity, water and gas infrastructure across Ukraine.\n\nIn a video message posted to Telegram on Tuesday evening local time, Zelensky said that 85 missile strikes had been launched against Ukraine so far, and warned there may be more to come.\n\n“We can see what the enemy wants, they will not succeed,” he said. “We may yet have 20 more strikes, please look after yourselves, stay in shelter for some time.”\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv, the city military administration said that one person had been killed. Two explosions had been heard, it added, instructing residents to remain in shelters. It said four missiles had been shot down.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko then said there had been a third strike. “Another hit in Pechersk district of Kyiv city.

Authorities are working to restore the connection to the line, which was not damaged but was disconnected as a safety measure, he added.\n\nZelensky addresses G20\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Zelensky set out a proposal for ending the Russian invasion, according to a transcript shared by the Embassy of Ukraine in Indonesia on Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s peace plan has 10 steps including a path to nuclear safety, food security, a Special Tribunal for Russian war crimes, and a final peace treaty with Russia, according to the speech transcript.\n\nHe urged G20 leaders to use all of their power to “make Russia abandon nuclear threats” and implement a price cap on energy imported from Moscow.\n\nZelensky also called on Russia to stop bombing Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter approaches.\n\n“Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace,” he said.\n\nMoscow has been isolated at this year’s G20 summit as multiple Western leaders vowed not to have any contact with its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is in attendance on behalf of the Kremlin.\n\nWorld leaders condemned Tuesday’s strikes. At the summit, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a tweet that the attacks targeting Ukrainian cities “shows only Putin’s weakness,” who “is losing on the battlefield and – as we saw today at the G20 – diplomatically too.”\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said “at the moment we are hearing again of brutal Russian missile attacks on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv and other places, and especially again on civilian infrastructure,” during remarks on Tuesday with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi in Berlin.\n\nShe added that the attack “is also an unprecedented attack on nuclear safety and nuclear security.”", "authors": ["Julia Kesaieva Vasco Cotovio Tim Lister Sana Noor Haq", "Julia Kesaieva", "Vasco Cotovio", "Tim Lister", "Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/960716/kremlin-drone-attack-ukraine-counteroffensive", "title": "The mystery Kremlin drone attack and Ukraine's crucial ...", "text": "Explosions were heard across Ukraine last night after Russia accused Kyiv of trying to assassinate President Vladimir Putin with a drone attack on the Kremlin.\n\nUkraine has denied any involvement and said its air defences were subsequently forced to shoot down 18 out of 24 kamikaze drones launched by Moscow in a pre-dawn attack this morning.\n\n“We don’t attack Putin, or Moscow.

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov also “wildly” accused the US of masterminding the incident, said the Daily Beast, prompting the White House to insist it was not “encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders”.\n\nA CCTV image shows flames above the Kremlin Senate building on 3 May (Image credit: Kremlin Red Square CCTV/UPI/Shutterstock)\n\nThe footage of the Kremlin attack is “spectacular”, prompting “a furious guessing game and already a welter of conspiracy theories”, said Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor at Sky News. “Did Russia stage the attack?” he asked. It was “certainly filmed from almost every direction” and “will also be useful for the Putin regime as it tries to tamp down Victory Day commemorations next week”.\n\nShashank Joshi, defence editor for The Economist, said he was keeping an “open mind” and that people were “underestimating” the degree to which some Ukraine officials have been conducting attacks on Russian soil. This is seen by some as an opportunity to “puncture” the Kremlin’s sense of immunity from the war, he told the BBC World Service’s Newshour.\n\nBut the Institute for the Study of War believes it was staged “in an attempt to bring the war home to a Russian domestic audience and set conditions for a wider societal mobilisation”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIndeed, the “coming weeks may threaten Putin regime like never before”, said Sky’s Waghorn, as Ukraine is “limbering up with a mass of Western weaponry to do its worst”.\n\nThe counteroffensive\n\nUkraine is preparing to launch its counteroffensive against Russian forces, said The New York Times – and the future of the war hinges on its outcome.\n\nAccording to leaked Pentagon documents, 12 new Ukrainian brigades of 4,000 soldiers each, trained and supplied by the US and its Nato allies, are ready to go to war. Although shrouded in secrecy, “the operation is likely to unfold in the country’s south”, near the Black Sea coast and Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nThe hope is that these troops can penetrate Russian defences in one or more places along the 600-mile front line, said David Axe in The Daily Telegraph. If they succeed, “tanks and infantry can pour through into the enemy’s undefended rear areas” and split its forces in two. In military parlance, this is a “breach” – and achieving it is “one of the most complex and riskiest missions in land warfare”.\n\nBefore it can even start, “engineers have to clear a path through the mines”, flatten obstacles and fill trenches – “all while under enemy fire”, said Axe.\n\nThe likelihood of success\n\nPublicly, the Ukrainians are “bullish” about their long-anticipated offensive, said Mark Galeotti in The Sunday Times. They have more than 230 new Western tanks and 1,550 armoured vehicles. And so far, Ukraine’s military has out-thought and out-fought the Russians at nearly every stage of the war. But the chances of achieving another major success, like last September’s Kharkiv offensive in the northeast, are small.\n\nLeaked US documents suggest the counteroffensive is likely to make only “modest territorial gains”. The Russians have more soldiers and a far larger air force, and the Ukrainians may not even have enough missiles and shells: they “expend more 155mm shells in a month than America produces in a year”.\n\nYet despite the risks, President Zelenskyy has no choice but to press on, to give his Western backers what is “rather tastelessly” known as a “return on investment”: to prove they can fight on and win.\n\nOn the other side, though, the Russian military “is running on empty”, said Jonathan Sweet and Mark Toth in the Kyiv Post. The US estimates that more than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since December, said the BBC; by comparison, Russia lost around 14,500 during its decade-long Afghan war. And now the Russian advance has stalled.\n\nThe Ukrainians need a military success “with enough symbolic power to force change in Russia”, said Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic. A successful counteroffensive could not just change the course of the war, but “alter geopolitics for a generation”. Ukraine’s allies must do everything in their power to ensure that it goes to plan.\n\nDrumming up support\n\nIn the Netherlands, Zelenskyy has delivered a speech entitled “There is no peace without justice”. He is also visiting the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March.\n\nThe “wartime leader has visited the US and several EU countries in a bid to drum up support” since the invasion began, said Politico.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy waits to make his speech at The Hague on 4 May (Image credit: Remko de Waal/ANP/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBack in Ukraine, explosions were heard in Kyiv as well as the Ukrainian cities of Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south overnight. Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, wrote on Telegram that the capital had “not experienced such a heavy intensity of attacks since the beginning of this year”, but that there had been no civilian casualties.\n\nBoth sides have “stepped up air attacks” ahead of the expected counteroffensive by Kyiv, said the Financial Times.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/15/could-ukraine-win-war-against-russia/10365025002/", "title": "Could Ukraine's dramatic gains be a turning point in war with Russia?", "text": "A stunningly successful Ukrainian military counteroffensive has reclaimed thousands of miles of occupied territory in just two weeks while energizing the Ukrainian population, fomenting dissent in Russia and sending some of Moscow's worn-down forces scrambling in retreat.\n\nHas the brutal war reached a turning point?\n\nMost experts are expressing cautious optimism. John Kirby, the National Security Council's coordinator for strategic communications at the White House, at a briefing this week described the war as a \"dynamic situation\" and stressed that it was unpredictable.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels –bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles,many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/11/19/biden-congress-ukraine-aid-trump/76427250007/", "title": "Biden won't fight Congress on Ukraine aid before Trump takes office", "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO – President Joe Biden does not plan to push Congress to pass additional Ukraine aid and will instead focus on distributing assistance that has already been approved.\n\nBiden’s administration is racing to transfer weapons to Ukraine before the outgoing president leaves office in January.\n\nEquipment has been slow to move in recent weeks, and a revised estimate from the Pentagon puts the amount the Biden administration has at its disposal higher than was previously known.\n\n“The focus is on utilizing the resources we currently have,” a senior administration official told USA TODAY. “We are in the midst of surging military aid to Ukraine to put them in the best possible position as the president directed.”\n\nTime is running out to get more than $7 billion in equipment to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. A new package the official said was expected to be released last Thursday had still not come by Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"The President has committed to ensuring that every dollar that Congress is allocated will be spent,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"We roll out packages frequently. I don't have one to announce today, but when we do, you're going to see that cadence continue throughout the year and through the end of the administration,\" she said.\n\nBiden rushes to release aid before Trump enters office\n\nBiden has faced pressure from Ukraine’s president and others to strengthen Kyiv’s position before he leaves office, including supporting the country’s push to join the NATO alliance.\n\nHe quietly lifted restrictions on Ukraine’s use of long-range U.S. weapons this week, and on Tuesday, Ukraine launched its first strikes with the missile system. The long-range missiles can hit targets nearly 200 miles from their ground-based launch sites.\n\nDeputy National Security adviser Jon Finer said the deployment of around 11,000 North Korean troops to Russia to join the war constituted “a significant Russian escalation.” Those troops have likely moved into Kursk, a region of Russia taken by Ukraine in an August incursion near the border, Singh said Monday.\n\nBefore the U.S. presidential election, Biden ordered the Department of Defense to release all of the remaining security assistance that Congress appropriated for Ukraine before the end of his term.\n\nHe authorized the transfer of $5.5 billion in equipment to ensure his administration could “fully utilize the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine and then replenish U.S. stockpiles.”\n\nThe Pentagon now says it has up to $7.1 billion authorized through Biden’s presidential authority that it can use to supply Ukraine with weapons.\n\nMore:Where's Joe Biden? U.S. president misses G20 Summit group photo in Brazil\n\nIt also has an additional $2.1 billion to spend on air defense, Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, air-to-ground munitions and more through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.\n\nThe initiative authorizes aid through contracts for weapons in the future, while the drawdown pulls from existing stocks and pays to replenish them.\n\nStill, the Biden administration has publicly maintained that it can deliver billions of dollars in remaining aid in two months.\n\n“The overriding strategic role for the rest of this term on Ukraine is to make Ukraine as strong as possible. And that means surging as much materiel and equipment as we can get into Ukraine over the course of the near term,” Finer said Monday at the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n“It means using all of the funds that have been appropriated for the United States to provide Ukraine during the rest of this term and this administration. We are on track to execute that,” Finer said.\n\nWhite House focuses on disaster relief\n\nBiden is attending the G20 Summit in Brazil. He is scheduled to return to the U.S. on Tuesday evening.\n\n“The United States strongly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' he told leaders of the world's top economies, including Russia's foreign minister, on Monday. \"Everyone around this table, in my view, should as well.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Biden administration asked Congress for more disaster relief assistance, totaling nearly $100 billion. It notably did not ask for assistance for Ukraine at that time.\n\nCongress last approved Ukraine aid in April. That bill included more than $60 billion in support for Ukraine. The U.S. also announced a $20 billion loan for Ukraine in October that is backed by the interest from frozen Russian assets.\n\n“Ukraine is obviously going to need additional support, there's no doubt about that,” Finer told USA TODAY at his briefing. “What vehicle, what timing, I will not get into from the podium here, but Ukraine is going to need additional support going forward if it's going to stay in the fight. I think that's self-evident.\"\n\nClock ticks down to Congress spending deadline\n\nCongress must pass new spending authority by Dec. 20 to prevent a government shutdown. Assistance for Ukraine could be part of those discussions.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson suggested on Sunday that Republicans favor waiting until next year to pass a broad spending deal that goes beyond extending already agreed-upon funding levels through a mechanism known as a continuing resolution.\n\nDemocrats currently control the White House and the U.S. Senate. Republicans have the majority of seats in the House. In the new Congress, Republicans will hold a majority of seats in both legislative chambers. And after Trump takes office on Jan. 20, the GOP will have a trifecta.\n\nMore:Biden lets Ukraine launch long-range missiles into Russia. What's it mean for the war?\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, who is Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, suggested to reporters last week, before his selection was announced, that there was not an appetite among Republicans on Capitol Hill to have a debate over Ukraine aid this year.\n\n“Let’s wait ‘til the new administration is in place before we configure that,” Rubio, R-Fla., said. “We still have to fund the government next month just to be able to finish here.”\n\nOn Monday evening, Sen. Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said the Biden administration is working to get out as much aid to Ukraine as possible before the handoff.\n\n\"We only have a couple months, so even if they got more authorization, they can't get it out quick enough,\" Cardin, D-Md., said.\n\n“I worry about what's going to happen under the Trump administration, but I do think there is clear bipartisan support for Ukraine beyond just this budget year,” Cardin said.\n\nMore:Biden in the background at G20 Summit as leaders brace for second go-round with Trump\n\nTrump's Ukraine rhetoric sparks concern\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he'd negotiate with Russia to end the war, putting U.S. allies and supporters of Ukraine on edge. On the campaign trail, he said he will end the war \"in a day\" without elaborating on how he would resolve the conflict.\n\nIn a podcast interview last month, Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s requests for aid, calling him “one of the greatest salesmen I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean I don’t want to help him because I feel very badly for those people,\" he said of Zelenskyy. \"But he should never have let that war start.\"\n\nHe has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “genius.” In a call after his election victory, he reportedly advised Putin not to escalate the war. Russia’s Kremlin has denied that the call took place.\n\nIncoming vice president JD Vance proposed in September that Trump could end the war by freezing the Russia-Ukraine border along the current battle lines – allowing Russia to keep the land it has seized, and fortifying Ukraine against a future Russian invasion.\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

Now, scientists have found one of the ingredients in the triangle-shaped tasty tortilla chips has a superpower – it can make the skin of mice transparent.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University detail, in the Sept. 6 issue of the journal Science, how they were able to see through the skin of live mice by applying a mixture of water and tartrazine, a bright yellow-orange food coloring used in Doritos and other foods, drugs, and cosmetics.\n\nThe experiments arose from the quest for better methods to see tissue and organs within the body. The researchers chose tartrazine because the dye's molecules absorb blue and ultraviolet light, which makes it easier for light to pass through the mouse skin.\n\n“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said Zihao Ou, the lead author of the study who is now an assistant professor of physics at The University of Texas at Dallas, in a description of the research on the university's website.\n\nAre cellphones a risk for cancer?:Not likely, report says.\n\nThe Doritos effect: Snack ingredient yields invisible mouse\n\nAfter testing the dye on mice tissue samples and raw chicken breast, the researchers rubbed the dye and water solution onto the skulls and abdomens of the mice. As the dye was absorbed, within a few minutes they could see \"the skin, muscle, and connective tissues transparent in live rodents,\" the researchers write in the journal article.\n\nOnce researchers wash off the dye, the mice lost their translucency and the dye is excreted through urine, according to the university site's description of the study. “It’s important that the dye is biocompatible – it’s safe for living organisms,” Ou said. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work.”\n\nBefore you start slathering yourself in Doritos – the coloring is used in several Doritos flavors including Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch and Flaming Hot Nacho – tartrazine won't necessarily give humans a cloak of invisibility á la Harry Potter.\n\nThat's because human skin is about 10 times thicker than a mouse and it's not sure how much of the dye – or how it would be administered – is needed to work in humans, Ou said.\n\nResearchers plan to continue investigating that and experiment with other substances that could outperform tartrazine.\n\n“Optical equipment, like the microscope, is not directly used to study live humans or animals because light can’t go through living tissue,\" Ou said. \"But now that we can make tissue transparent, it will allow us to look at more detailed dynamics. It will completely revolutionize existing optical research in biology.”\n\nIn an accompanying editorial article in the journal, biophotonics researcher Christopher Rowlands and experimental optical physicist Jon Gorecki, both at the Imperial College London, compare the finding to H.G. Wells' 1897 novel \"The Invisible Man.\"\n\nCombined with other techniques, the tartrazine development could result in \"permitting deeper imaging than either could alone,\" they wrote.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Video clips of Queen provide a blueprint for their look, just as Mercury's personal lyrics offer insights into his character, the aggregation of the complex thought patterns swirling inside his head.\n\nBut the special effects artists who transferred Mercury's look to Malek and the screenwriter who created the frame for Malek's art also have trails for armchair detectives to follow to learn how cinema interfaced with reality.\n\nTwo-time Oscar-nominated screenwriter Anthony McCarten created the antecedent for \"Bohemian Rhapsody's\" stepping-stone narrative leading to a mighty crescendo in his Winston Churchill biopic, “Darkest Hour.” The first 100 minutes of that film, starring Palm Springs-based Oscar winner Gary Oldman, built to one of the 20th century’s greatest speeches: “We shall fight on the beaches; we shall fight on the landing grounds; we shall fight in the fields… we shall never surrender!”\n\n“Bohemian Rhapsody” features similar cinematic architecture. Its first 100 minutes build to one of the 20th century’s greatest concert sets – Queen’s 20-minute performance at the 1985 Live Aid benefit at London’s Wembley Stadium – and Malek gives it an Oldman-level swing for the fences, inspiring the Palm Springs International Film Festival to select him for a Breakthrough Performance Award at its Jan. 3 Film Awards Gala.\n\nCoachella Valley friends who knew Mercury echo the praise critics have heaped upon Malek’s performance.\n\n“I thought he had come back,” said Lorna Luft, who hung out with Queen after moving to London in the 1960s. “At one point, my husband and I grabbed each other, and I said, ‘This is really weird,’ because I think he embodied him. I don’t think he was doing an impersonation. He was brilliant.”\n\n“His performance really draws you in,” said Spike Edney, Queen’s music director who played keyboards with the band at Live Aid. “I think it’s quite a difficult task for him to try to play a character as complex as Freddie Mercury. But he does it really well.”\n\nAnother McCarten film that sent its star through the Palm Springs film fest on his way to an Oscar, “The Theory of Everything” with Eddie Redmayne, has more threads tying it to “Bohemian Rhapsody” than even “Darkest Hour.” Malek and Redmayne discovered that during a conversation in November at Hollywood’s Governor Awards.\n\nMalek, who broke through to television audiences with his Emmy Award-winning portrait of the disturbed genius Elliot Alderson in “Mr. Robot,” drew inspiration from Redmayne’s portrait of the quadriplegic genius, Stephen Hawking, in “The Theory of Everything.”\n\nMalek used Redmayne’s movement coach, Polly Bennett, to make him walk and prance like Mercury. He used his hair and makeup designer, Jan Sewell, to give him a more aquiline nose. He used Redmayne’s special effects teeth specialist, Chris Lyons, to give him oversized upper teeth. He also dove deep into Mercury’s path to AIDS just as Redmayne studied Hawking’s journey into the depths of ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease.\n\n“He’s who I got the initial idea for this from,” Malek said in an open, revealing telephone interview from New York. “I kind of said, ‘Give me the Eddie Redmayne team.’”\n\nFinding the soul of character, whether it’s real, fictional or both, can be a mystical experience that actors don’t often like to articulate. But Malek, 37, shared his journey to find a Freddie Mercury that could convey McCarten’s partially made-up story.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles to Egyptian immigrant parents, Malek didn’t grow up idolizing Queen like many who recognized the historical significance of the band.\n\nMore:'Bohemian Rhapsody' star Rami Malek to be honored for breakthrough performance as Freddie Mercury\n\nMore:Bradley Cooper will be honored for his directorial debut with 'A Star is Born'\n\nMore:Sonny Bono Visionary Award going to director of red-hot art film, 'Roma'\n\nMore:Melissa McCarthy to receive Spotlight Award at Palm Springs film festival\n\nQueen attracted record-sized audiences in the 1980s, including several of over 100,000 people. Their 1981 “Game” Tour of South America included a concert in Buenos Aires that drew 300,000 people, the largest single-concert crowd in Argentine history.\n\nQueen is the only quartet with all four members in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and they each have hits justifying such recognition. Drummer Roger Taylor wrote or co-wrote “Radio Ga Ga” and “These Are the Days of Our Lives.” Guitarist Brian May composed “We Will Rock You” and “Tie Your Mother Down.” Bassist John Deacon (who retired after Mercury’s death in 1991) composed “Another One Bites the Dust” and “You’re My Best Friend.” Mercury was the band’s most prolific songwriter, but eventually, they all shared songwriting credits. Their hit with David Bowie, “Under Pressure,” evolved from a jam session.\n\nBut Queen has had roller coaster levels of success. They hit it big in the early '70s with their eclectic, guitar-driven, multi-layered instrumentals and vocal harmonies. They regained popularity in the ‘80s, after a short absence from the American charts, with a more electronic sound. They were rediscovered after Mercury’s death with the inclusion of the operatic hit, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” in the 1992 film, “Wayne’s World.”\n\nFor the past six years, Queen has been enchanting new audiences with Adam Lambert singing and paying tribute to Mercury.\n\n“I have a best friend who named his child Freddie Mercury,” Malek said. “He did that about two years prior to me getting the role. So, we grew up listening to Queen and Freddie Mercury. I didn’t have the extensive knowledge that I do now. ... I’m a fanatic now.”\n\nMalek didn’t initially see himself as Mercury. He doesn’t sing, so all the vocals would have to be dubbed. But they’re both descended from ancient cultures. Mercury’s family are Parsees (followers of the 6th century BCE Persian prophet Zoroaster) who migrated to Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean before settling in England.\n\nProducer Denis O’Sullivan saw Malek portray the detached, socially-anxious Elliot in “Mr. Robot” and told fellow producer Graham King, “I think we’ve found our Freddie.” Malek met them in Los Angeles, on a break from “Mr. Robot,” and King said Malek had Mercury’s DNA.\n\n“I didn’t really realize in the moment, but they were pretty much offering me this role,” Malek said. “I wished them luck at the end of the meeting – with whoever they saw fit to play His Majesty – and they said, ‘No, this is yours if you want it.’ ”\n\nMalek had to make an audition tape for studio executives to secure the part, but, the next thing he did on his path to becoming Freddie was to watch “thousands of hours of Queen tapes.\n\n“I went online and ordered every book, all these albums and watched all the archival footage I could get my hands on,” he said. “I didn’t really know where to start. I just knew I had to absorb as much as I could in a very finite amount of time.”\n\nWhat surprised him most was the wit and charm Mercury exuded in interviews. He found a slyness or mischief behind his eyes that he emulated to help convey Mercury’s essence. But there were also physical mannerisms that Bennett, a movement practitioner at the Royal Shakespeare Company, helped him capture.\n\nBennett told Malek how to move like Mercury by giving him instructions an actor can understand, like, “You have a bubble bath streaming down your back. Now giraffe it. Now, serve me some spaghetti.”\n\n“I’m not a numbers person, so 5-6-7-8 is not something that was very helpful to me,” Malek said. “So, if she tells me to stand like a giraffe, it’s odd, but it makes sense. We would look at interviews and think about what he’s talking about and his physicality and get behind the psychology of that as well.”\n\nThe film’s most important scene is the re-created Live Aid set. Director Bryan Singer and his crew rebuilt the demolished Wembley Stadium to scale on an old airstrip north of London. They sought Queen fans to react to the actors’ performance and hired more than 3,000 as extras. The filmmakers watched video of Queen’s Live Aid set frame-by-frame to ensure the film was faithful to the original performance, “beat-by-beat, gesture for gesture.”\n\nBut the production began by shooting the Live Aid scenes first. So, by day one, Malek and his bandmates had to act like they had the chemistry of a group that had been like a family for almost 15 years. Taylor and May also were scheduled to watch the dailies, as the film’s executive music producers, to see if they were conveying the music’s feel.\n\n“I think we all freaked out at the thought of that,” Malek said, “but, what Polly had us do before we would work on any performance, we would kind of touch in, which means we would look each other in the eye and physically huddle with one another and make sure we had eye contact and physical contact. That might come off a bit silly, but, I’ll tell you, when we went out to perform Live Aid in one long take on the fifth or sixth day – the entire concert, start to finish with five or six different cameras – you’re touching in there. You need each other to be extremely present. You’re depending on one another in every single moment. You wouldn’t believe how tight we are, the boys and I and the entire cast. Still.”\n\nEdney said Queen prepared for that set as seriously as they approached every show. The script built drama in getting Queen added to the Live Aid bill, but Edney recalled in 2016 that he was the one who delivered the message that promoter Bob Geldof wanted Queen to play his benefit. Edney played trombone in Geldof’s Boomtown Rats before joining Queen on keyboards, so he was a natural bridge.\n\nGeldof had heard through a grapevine, Edney added in November, that Taylor was somewhat miffed at not being asked to join Geldof’s charity supergroup, Band Aid. Their recording of “Do They Know It’s Christmas,” which raised funds to combat the famine in Ethiopia, became an historic hit. So, Geldof asked Edney to gauge the band’s willingness to play Live Aid.\n\n“He said, ‘I’m not going to ask them until I know they’ll say yes,’ which I think was understandable,” Edney said. “So, I got on the plane to New Zealand (to start a tour) and, if my memory serves, we went out to dinner and I broached the subject. I think it was John Deacon who said, ‘Why doesn’t he ask us himself?’ I said, ‘He wants me to find out what your answer’s going to be and if you’re really interested you’ll receive the question. If you’re not really interested, he won’t bother asking you.’ They wanted to know more, so that’s when Geldof got in touch with (Queen’s manager) Jim Beach.”\n\nThe band members had their quarrels in the ‘80s, but the July 13 Live Aid appearance wasn’t a comeback. They had completed their Far East tour just two months earlier. Their previous break came three months after playing before 300,000 people a night at the first Rock in Rio festival in Brazil. Mercury had just recorded a solo album, as noted in the film, but Taylor and May had recorded solo projects before him.\n\nThe band’s short absence from the American charts, Edney said, was caused by MTV’s refusal to play a video from Queen's \"The Works\" LP. The band dressed as women in the “I Want To Break Free” video and MTV objected to what it called “cross-dressing.”\n\nBut Edney said the video, which was re-enacted in the film, made no sexual intimations.\n\n“They were dressed as characters from English soap operas,” he said. “They were instantly recognizable to the English audience and totally regarded as tongue-in-cheek. We got the joke, but Americans didn’t because they had no references. So MTV, in this weird kind of right wing reaction, said, ‘We can’t see men in female attire on TV.’ They wouldn’t show it. On that album, ‘Radio 'Ga Ga' and ‘I Want To Break Free’ were massive hits in the rest of the world, but not in America. So, that signified a hiatus of their previously upward career.”\n\nEvery band at Live Aid was given 20 minutes to perform and Edney recalled spending two or three days figuring out what to play and how to fit songs into medleys. They opened with the first part of their usual closing number, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” featuring the intriguing lyrics:\n\n“Too late, my time has come/ Sends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time/ Goodbye, everybody, I’ve got to go/ Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.”\n\nThe set really kicked into gear when they played the next song, “Radio Ga Ga,\" Edney said. The English audience knew the video and emulated it.\n\n“When they got to the chorus, they all copied the video of doing the hand-clap in the air,” Edney said. “When you go on stage at something like that, you don’t know how much of the audience knows your (material). There are so many artists out there, and the event itself was attracting people who just wanted to be there. So, you don’t know how many of those people are actually there for you. But, when I saw the hands go up, I thought, ‘OK, this is going to be good.’”\n\nEdney, who also plays guitar, spent most of the set behind Deacon’s amplifier. He came downstage to play Mercury’s grand piano on “Crazy Little Thing Called Love,” but, it wasn’t captured on video. He’d like to know if any cameras picked him up at Live Aid, but he’s comfortable not appearing in the film because, he said, “It wouldn’t necessarily reflect the visual of that day.”\n\nThe band played only the first verse and chorus of “We Will Rock You” before finishing with “We Are the Champions,” featuring its redemptive lyrics, “And bad mistakes, I’ve made a few/ I’ve had my share of sand kicked in my face/ But I’ve come through.”\n\nMercury strutted across stage with the energy of the live fans and a worldwide audience propping him up. Any issues of ethnic or sexual identity were overwhelmed by adrenaline.\n\n“There was no doubt in his mind about who he was,” Edney said. “Being on stage at Live Aid, I think you’ve got your legacy. He was just there having the time of his life and having fun with the audience that was responding to him. I think it was no deeper than that.”\n\nBut Malek had to tell McCarten’s story, a narrative driven by Mercury’s history with AIDS. Rock chroniclers have said the first indication that Mercury knew he had AIDS came in 1987. Edney said he and his Queen bandmates had no idea that Mercury knew he had it in 1985. But Malek had a story to convey. He drew from Mercury’s lyrics to keep his performance honest.\n\n“I can never say what Freddie Mercury was thinking in the moment,” Malek said. “Obviously, the subject of AIDS was very present at that time. Freddie said he was going to keep living his life the way he had been living it, and that was his choice. But, there easily could have been a moment down the road where he was playing another concert and did know. No one can speak to that. But, we had a finite amount of time to capture so much of his life. We didn’t want to shy away from anything. We wanted to celebrate every aspect of this human being. When I sat down and got to play ‘It’s been no bed of roses’ from ‘We Are the Champions,’ ‘it’s been no pleasure cruise,’ those are lyrics that exemplify who this man is and everything he went through, whether it was the early trials and tribulations and conflicted identity or having to deal with or come to terms and understand his sexual identity, which was obviously extremely stigmatized at the time, especially by his family’s religious faith.\n\n“‘We Are the Champions’ for me, at the end of that concert, (there are) things we can all relate to in their lyrics. But, when you really sit with them and think about the people who wrote and performed these songs, and for me especially Freddie, you can imbue them with such a deep level of pain and understanding, and ultimately a sense of triumph over tragedy.”\n\nMalek had to get inside Mercury’s head and react to the crowd of extras who were enjoying his performance to make it feel real. But he couldn’t get swept up in the moment because he also had to remember Mercury’s every move for the five or six cameras on him to make it look authentic. He had to find the balance between replication and art.\n\n“That was difficult,” he said. “At one point, I had to halt all of my activity in terms of the work I had been doing (to develop his character) and almost focus entirely on Live Aid. And I didn’t want to do that because I didn’t want to neglect all the other facets of the man. I wanted to always make sure I captured what he was feeling in the moment, according to the story – what I thought Freddie, in our version of the two hours you get to spend with him and the band, where he was. There are aspects where you want to pay homage as perfectly as you can to re-create that time on the Live Aid stage. But there are also moments where you have to play a certain fear for going out there for the period where he did have a bit of fragility and had to regain a certain confidence.”\n\nMalek found inspiration in Mercury’s approach to his performance. All the videos he watched, all the literature he read and all the people he talked to told him Mercury was a fearless performer, even if he had a sense of fragility in his real life. Malek conjured up the courage to give in totally to his character, to leave it all out there. But that also left him in a fragile state when the cameras stopped rolling.\n\n“When you go and look at his songs, you really get a sense of who he was and why he was spilling his soul so passionately,” Malek said. “So, what I’ve learned from Freddie Mercury is, when he sings a song, it’s something that means a lot to him. But, you have to take risks. So, I went out every day and tried to take as many risks as possible.\n\n“There was a moment early in the film, Tom Hollander (who plays Queen’s manager) came up to me in between takes and said, ‘Are you always this loud?’ I went to my dear friend Joe Mazzello (portraying Deacon), who I worked with on ‘The Pacific.’ I can confide in him. I said, ‘Have I screwed this up? Am I over the top? Does this feel ridiculous? Does this feel like some hokey interpretation?’ And he was like, ‘No, man, just stick to your gut. You got this.’\n\n“That was something I needed to propel myself forward, and by the end, I remember doing ‘Another One Bites the Dust’ and Tom being there. It had been quite a while since we had worked together, and he said something about, ‘Are you sure he never had a son?’ Something to that degree. It came full circle. You’ve got to take these risks in order to have any chance of being successful.”\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM:Subscribe today\n\nMalek conveys the sense in the Live Aid scenes that Mercury knew his time had come; that he had AIDS. But he also knew from his research that Mercury felt a freedom on stage that, “no matter what has happened to him, no matter what is going on, he can be so present and stand up in the most eloquent way, and move in ways a body has never been able to replicate, and have the time of his life.”\n\nMalek got to that point in the climactic performance scene. He knew it intuitively.\n\n“There were moments for me when I felt that something was operating on some levels I never felt before,” Malek said. “I can’t describe that feeling and I don’t want to attempt to because, in those moments is a beauty of where I, as Rami, get to feel like I am having the time of my life.”\n\nBruce Fessier is the Desert Sun's music, film and creative class reporter.

My best of 2016 Spotify playlist features the likes of Band of Horses, Pete Yorn and Yuck.\n\nBut come December, I shift from the music of Millennials to the music of Baby Boomers: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Ella Fitzgerald. I love Christmas carols!\n\nBut after the past few weeks of listening to Christmas music, I have a few questions and comments about some of these holiday classics.\n\nMy kids are gross and so are yours\n\nDrawing the line\n\nIt’s weird where we draw the line on what songs we consider to be in the canon of official Christmas carols. We all consider “I’ll be Home for Christmas” and “All I want for Christmas Is You” to be part of the Christmas canon, but not \"Good to Be Bad,\" an original song from the Pentatonix on their new record — no matter how many times they play it on the radio this year.\n\nThis is especially vexing given that many of the songs in the canon are weird and/or really weird. Like, have you listened to \"Baby It’s Cold Outside\" recently? \"The answer is no; But baby it’s bad out there? What’s in this drink?\" Good Lord, that escalated from innocent flirting to a couple of class A felonies quickly.\n\nThe best one\n\nIf you can’t admit or don’t know that \"O Holy Night\" is the best Christmas song, I can’t trust your judgment or honesty, and you shouldn’t be allowed to drive on our roadways or be near our pets and children. Although luckily, those kind of people are still eligible to be a candidate for president of the United States.\n\nRELATED:7 reasons parents are flipping out about bottle flipping\n\nRELATED:Self-driving cars? Sign me up!\n\nSay what?\n\nDo you ever find yourself wrapped up in a glass case of emotion, in awe imagining a little drummer boy standing before Jesus with nothing to give him; taking out his drum, and playing to honor him; playing his best? … And then hearing about farm animals keeping the beat and having the whole experience completely shattered?\n\nRudolph\n\nThose other reindeer sound like a bunch of jerks. And I don’t think anyone named Dancer or Prancer should be making fun of anyone, or excluding anyone from any sort of reindeer game.\n\nThe masters\n\nMichael Buble, Harry Connick Jr. and Josh Groban really are perfect Christmas carolers for the modern day. I’m not sure why we’re letting singers like Lady Gaga and Jimmy Buffett even try to sing Christmas carols just because we like them and they can carry a tune. I like Chip and Joanna Gaines, but I’m not asking them to sing me a bunch of holiday classics. … But I bet if they did, Pinterest would explode.\n\nPhoenix’s best\n\nHaving said that, Phoenix rockers Jimmy Eat World covered “Last Christmas” by Wham! and it’s exceptional.\n\n'Elf'\n\nSome of the best Christmas carols come from great movies.\n\n\"White Christmas\" is the standard bearer, but there are even a few songs from \"The Polar Express\" that show up on the radio occasionally that put you right in the middle of that new holiday classic.\n\nBut you know what stinks?\n\nNo Christmas songs from the best Christmas movie ever: \"Elf.\"\n\nTo this day, I answer the phone, “Buddy the Elf, what’s your favorite color.” Would anyone object to that little song he sang to his dad being on 99.9 KEZ and/or Sirius/XM Holly every now and then?\n\n\"I'm... I'm here with my dad. And we never met. And he wants me to sing him a song. And, um, I was adopted. But you didn't know I was born. So I'm here now. I found you, Daddy. And guess what? I love you. I love you. I love you!\"\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year?\n\n\"Do They Know It’s Christmas\" is also really great. With an all-star roster of legends from 1984, including Bono, Paul McCartney and Boy George (and Phil Collins on drums!), it’s not only a great '80s-y song, but it’s a good reminder that not everyone gets a special Christmas and it’s important to give back (in particular, to the starving people in Africa). Here’s a snippet of that uplifting classic:\n\n\"It's a world of dread and fear, where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears. And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom. Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you.\"\n\nUmm, settle down fellas. Maybe overselling it a skosh, like the Macy’s marketing campaign. We get it: you’re having a sale. Similarly, we know, there was a famine in Africa. But lighten up a tad, Bono. It’s the hap-happiest season of all.\n\nDominic Verstegen is a 40-something dad living in Phoenix and documenting his life in occasional columns.

Apa).\n\nNeither CW nor Warner Bros. Television, which produces the series, has announced plans. But here’s a quick update of where “Riverdale” stands: 13 of 22 Season 3 episodes have aired, with a 14th scheduled for Wednesday (8 EST/PST). Fred is expected to appear in any episodes Perry shot before the stroke.\n\nMore:Luke Perry, 'Beverly Hills, 90210' and 'Riverdale' star, dies at 52 after massive stroke\n\nMore:Why you're taking Luke Perry's sudden death so hard: A look at the '90210' star's life\n\nThe drama, a reimagining of the Archie Comics characters that has performed well for CW, has already been renewed for a fourth season.\n\nAlthough Perry’s Fred is not a main character in “Riverdale” – and overall the show has pared back on adult storylines this season – his absence requires resolution. The drama series revolves around Archie and his high-school contemporaries, but wise Fred serves as a grounded presence amid the tempest of “Riverdale” teen drama.\n\nA look at how past shows have dealt with actor deaths provides an idea of what options “Riverdale” might consider. In most cases, the accompanying character also dies. (That also has happened in cases that don't involve an actor's death, most recently with the off-screen death of matriarch Roseanne Conner on ABC's \"The Conners,\" a spinoff that arose after the firing of Roseanne Barr and cancellation of \"Roseanne.\")\n\nIn some cases, the show can’t (or won’t) go on, to contradict an entertainment bromide, as the actor is too integral or the program is not established enough to survive.\n\nBill Paxton of 'Training Day'\n\nThat happened in 2017 with CBS’ “Training Day,” after Paxton, who played one of the two main characters and was by far the show’s biggest star, died as first-season shows were airing. CBS broadcast all 13 episodes, which finished shooting before Paxton’s death, and then canceled the series, which may have happened anyway due to poor ratings.\n\nIn recent years, programs have more readily acknowledged an actor's death, either through the accompanying character's demise or some type of dedication, than in the past, when the mention of real-life death might have seemed too sensitive and viewers were less likely to be as knowledgeable about behind-the-scenes happenings.\n\nCory Monteith of 'Glee'\n\nMonteith was a major “Glee” character when he died at the age of 31 in 2013. The fifth-season Fox musical dramedy took a production break before eventually presenting a Season 5 tribute episode that dealt with the death of his character, quarterback Finn. Later, executive producer Ryan Murphy revealed his hoped-for final series scene, which was precluded by Monteith's death. \"Glee,\" which already had begun major cast changes before Monteith's death, ended after its sixth season.\n\nJohn Ritter of '8 Simple Rules'\n\nA decade earlier, “8 Simple Rules” went on after the death of central star Ritter, who died in 2003 during the ABC comedy’s second season. After a break, “Rules” returned, acknowledging the death of Ritter’s family patriarch, Paul, while bringing in James Garner and David Spade as new cast members. The show ran for three seasons, with ratings falling significantly after Ritter’s death.\n\nJohn Spencer of 'The West Wing'\n\nIn the case of actors in supporting roles on established programs, the situation closest to Perry and “Riverdale,” the show historically has moved on, with the character’s death usually written into the story, as was the case with Leo McGarry of \"The West Wing\" after Spencer's 2005 death. Often, the actor is honored with some form of on-screen dedication.\n\nMiguel Ferrer of 'NCIS: Los Angeles' and Glenne Headly of 'Future Man'\n\nBesides Paxton, other 2017 actor deaths included Ferrer, whose character's demise and a tribute were part of a posthumous episode of CBS’ “NCIS: Los Angeles,” and Headly, who played the main character's mother on Hulu’s “Future Man.” The talented actors made significant contributions to their shows, but each played a supporting character whose departure didn’t affect the program’s continuation.\n\nCarol Ann Susi of 'The Big Bang Theory'\n\nVoice actors not seen on screen are theoretically easier to replace in the event of death, but some shows have chosen to honor valued cast members by retiring the characters. CBS’ “The Big Bang Theory” commemorated the 2014 loss of Susi, who played Howard's unforgettably loud, raspy and hilarious (but unseen) mother, with a story in which she dies in her sleep.\n\nMarcia Wallace of 'The Simpsons'\n\n“The Simpsons” retired teacher Edna Krabappel after the 2013 death of Marcia Wallace, who voiced the beloved character. The show later offered a tribute to Wallace with an epilogue from another character, Ned Flanders. In the 1990s, the long-running animated classic made a similar move, ending popular characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz after the death of Phil Hartman.\n\nNicholas Colasanto of 'Cheers'\n\nIn cases where a character doesn’t have a specific family relationship, as Perry’s Fred does as Archie’s father, replacement can succeed, especially when the newcomer has a different personality. Woody Harrelson became a star as Woody, the sweetly dim-witted bartender who joined “Cheers” after the 1985 death of Colasanto, who played gruff, lovable Coach.\n\nChristopher Evan Welch of 'Silicon Valley'\n\nWhen Welch died in 2013 after filming five episodes of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” his character, venture capitalist Peter Gregory, was mentioned in the remaining Season 1 episodes. Season 2 introduced Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer), who was as socially awkward as Peter but less empathetic. The fact that both \"Cheers\" and \"Silicon Valley\" were fairly new at the time of the actors' deaths might have made it easier to make replacements.\n\n“Riverdale” will do the best it can to adjust and continue after the loss of an important family member. As other shows have found, that’s a difficult hole to fill professionally, much the same as it is personally.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/media/2018/07/20/veteran-phoenix-tv-reporter-mike-watkiss-retire-3-tv-cbs-5/802263002/", "title": "Phoenix TV reporter Mike Watkiss at 3TV, CBS 5 to retire", "text": "Mike Watkiss, one of the most colorful personalities in the Phoenix news market, has announced that he's retiring from Channel 3 (KTVK) and Channel 5 (KPHO).

I want to be able to walk out of there with my head held high.\"\n\nHe's kidding. Well, sort of.\n\nWatkiss is an honored journalist who produced the Emmy and Edward R.

That was great! Come work for us!' And that's the way my family and I ended up here.\"\n\nWatkiss earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Stanford and a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. He then enjoyed an eight-year run on the syndicated TV show \"A Current Affair.\"\n\n\"When 'A Current Affair' came on the air, all of the American purist journalists said, 'This is horrible,' and the ultimate result was the whole industry jumped in behind us. I did some of the best, most hard-hitting work in my career for 'A Current Affair,' and also a lot of bull (expletive).\"\n\nDuring his \"A Current Affair\" years, Watkiss covered such headline-making stories as the Los Angeles riots, the Oklahoma City bombing, \"Night Stalker\" killer Richard Ramirez and the Tonya Harding scandal.\n\nYou figure with all his years in the industry, he should have a great book in him. He does, and in typical Watkiss fashion, he downplays it.\n\n\"I don't delude myself that anybody is going to be interested in my stories, but it's kind of the stories behind the stories: How I got into a jail cell with the Night Stalker, ambushing Elizabeth Taylor on an airplane, things like that. Honestly, I feel like the luckiest guy in the world. I'm just a hyperactive kid, sort of a storyteller, and I've serendipitously been in the right place at the right time. Or wrong time: I was there the morning they found Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson's bodies.\"\n\nWhat's next\n\nPost-retirement plans including finishing the book — he's written 200 pages — and acting (he has a surprisingly robust IMDB page). He's recently finished three films and is working with his son on a screenplay inspired by his career.\n\nHe plans to stay in the Phoenix area and has no desire to work in another television market.\n\n\"I'm not going to do day-to-day news anymore,\" he says. \"I'm an old man now, and (I don't want) the day-to-day pressure. I've lived most of my career going too fast and beating myself up.\"\n\nHis distinctive old-school personality and style — he writes his script longhand on a yellow legal pad — made him a unique figure in the sea of TV reporters.\n\n\"There’s a lot of folks in television, and not all of them would stand out like Mike,\" says Edward L. Munson Jr., station VP and general manager. \"He has a very unique style. He's a guy that grabs the throat of the story and hangs on to it. He's not afraid to go into situations that others would be timid to do. He's a bulldog that way.\"\n\n'A fearless reporter'\n\nMunson came to work with Watkiss when 3TV and CBS 5 merged.\n\n\"When I first came here, I thought, 'He doesn't quite fit with the AZFamily image that well.' It was like that kids' game, 'Which one of these things is not like the other?' \" Munson recalls with a chuckle. \"But I’ve come to appreciate that he is pretty much a fearless reporter. His loyalty is getting to the truth more than anything else.\"\n\nGranted, the two men don't always have an ideal relationship.\n\n\"It’s hell to get him to fill out a time card on the computer,\" Munson says. \"Instead of researching in the newsroom on a computer, he'd rather be out talking to people to find out what happened.\"\n\nWatkiss says he appreciates that 3TV let him be himself.\n\n\"I'm a little bit out of the box, and it takes some fortitude for management to allow a spicy character like me to do my thing, and Channel 3 has always been really good,\" he says. \"They've been very accommodating and hospitable. They've never changed me, God bless 'em.\"\n\nHe says he'll \"desperately\" miss his newsroom family.\n\n\"I love the people there,\" he says. \"The one thing I always tell young reporters is to make sure the crew gets lunch. My career has been based on working with some great camera people — they do all the work and I get all the credit. I'm so grateful. I liken it to playing jazz with Miles Davis. When you've got a really good camera guy and a reporter working out in the field, you're playing together and you can create some really beautiful stuff.\"\n\nPerhaps his loss will be felt most by viewers, who have relied on his no-holds-barred storytelling. He says the feeling is mutual.\n\n\"I've never been that person that takes viewers for granted,\" he says. \"If somebody's going to be kind enough to allow somebody like me into their front room for a couple of minutes every day, you better have some respect for them and be grateful that you're a guest in their home.\"\n\nReach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

DuPont Middle School was like a party.\n\nIn the dim of early evening, music played and food trucks provided refreshments to voters on their way to cast their votes and candidates supporters.\n\nThere were many primary candidates present including Wilmington City Council candidates Maria Cabrera, Alexander Hackett, Shane Darby, Coby Owens and Danielle Covington.\n\nOne candidate for mayor, Velda Jones Potter, was also there. Gov. John Carney had been there earlier in the day. New Castle County council candidate Monique Johns and candidate for Lt. Governor Sherry Dorsey Walker were there as well.\n\nOne Wilmington resident, who asked to be identified as Tasha G., ran into P.S. DuPont to cast her vote right before the polls closed. She was the last voter out.\n\nWhile she wouldn’t say who she voted for, she said she was looking for a change.\n\nShe said she hopes elected leaders institute programs focused on young teens offering alternatives to activities that lead to gun violence.

Hartley-Nagle, after making similar stops county-wide, ended up at P.S. DuPont Middle School in Wilmington.\n\nVoter turnout around the county was “slow but steady\" Tuesday, but both Henry and Hartley-Nagle reported seeing enthusiastic community members showing up to cast their vote.\n\nHenry, who previously worked for the county as general manager of community services and economic development and policy director, said that this experience makes him stand out.\n\n“I’ve worked under three county executives in their administrations, running departments,” Henry said. “I think I’m imminently qualified for this office, and I’m excited for the opportunity.”\n\nSimilarly, Hartley-Nagle, who has served as New Castle County President since 2016, also thinks her experience will distinguish her from her opponent during Tuesday's primary.\n\n“My experience over the last eight years as a council president, I’ve been doing that job, still representing the whole county and integrating myself into every issue,” Hartley-Nagle said.\n\n- Reporter Molly McVety\n\nPolls close, results not yet published on state elections website\n\nPolls closed at 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nWhile the state election result website was live as of 8:07 p.m., no results had yet been recorded.\n\nAbout 590,000 of Delaware's 782,000 registered voters were eligible to vote Tuesday.

Dupont Middle School on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDozens of people representing and supporting candidates for both state and county-wide races showed out in big numbers, welcoming cars into the crowded parking lot and directing people to voting booths.\n\nThe two candidates vying for the position of Wilmington mayor were also present at the middle school, which is historically one of the most centrally-located and highly-visited polling places in both the city and county.\n\nOutgoing Gov. John Carney spoke about the need to campaign on a smaller scale than his team is typically used to − though he visited at least six different polling locations Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“It’s much more intense, much more personal and individual-focused,” Carney said of running for mayor versus governor. “It’s not clear if they’re going to vote for me.\"\n\nHe added that regardless of Tuesday's result, he's \"just going to be happy that I did my best.\"\n\n\"One way or the other, it will be positive,” Carney said.\n\nVelda Jones-Potter, Wilmington's former treasurer, said she'd also been to a number of polling places throughout the day.\n\n“I heard them say they’re excited for some change,” Jones-Potter said. “I think the main thing is for us to really focus on people in this city: Communities, neighborhoods, people and meeting some of the fundamental needs that people have.\"\n\nThe environment at P.S.

Here's a rundown of Meyer's campaign, as well as those of his two opponents in today's primary.\n\nThrowback: Gordon v. Meyer (and Grimaldi) plus internet sock puppets in 2016\n\nThe controversy around the current Democratic primary for governor contains a parallel to the great sock puppet battle of the 2016 race for New Castle County Executive.\n\nLeading up to that race, then-incumbent Tom Gordon had just gone through an epic breakup with his second-in-charge and once protégé David Grimaldi. During the fallout, Grimaldi began leaking phone calls he recorded with Gordon, creating some wild sound clips and subsequent newspaper articles.\n\nThen, dueling sock puppet accounts posting on Twitter drove the county political scene bonkers and spawned at least one lawsuit as election season built toward the primary.\n\nOne anonymous account was Ncco_Politics, which leaked Grimald's phone recordings and trashed Gordon with posts like one that featured Gordon as a windup doll that can only answer questions with subjects, verbs and the word \"police.\"\n\nThen there was the Victoria Hobson account, who did double duty trashing Grimaldi and Gordon's opponent.\n\nMatt Meyer, then a political newcomer and Gordon's opponent in the primary, sought to distance himself from the fray, loaning his campaign a raft of cash and purchasing dramatic television ads that tied Gordon's past corruption allegations to the troubles of his then-current administration.\n\nMeyer eventually won that primary and, after eight years as county executive, is now vying to be Delaware's next governor. Some of the controversy around Bethany Hall-Long, one of his current opponents, contains a common character from Grimaldi's clandestine recordings.\n\nIn one, Grimaldi asks Gordon why he didn't fire Dana Hall-Long, Bethany Hall-Long's husband, for reportedly leveraging his position as a government housing contractor to pressure voters living in subsidized housing to support his wife, then a rising state legislator in 2014.\n\nIn the recording, Gordon told Grimaldi that when he learned who Dana Hall-Long was married to, he thought: \"woah, in that case, everyone deserves a second chance.\" A link to that recording is below.\n\nThe Ncco_Politics account − which Grimaldi, despite obvious connections, never publicly admitted to operating − no longer exists. However, the Victoria Hobson account, which Gordon's daughter later copped to, is still around.\n\nHere's a link to the current controversy around Hall-Long's campaign and husband.\n\nAnd here's a link to information about the Democratic candidates vying for governor.\n\nAnd, in case you're interested, here is that phone call:\n\nEmbedded content: https://www.delawareonline.com/videos/news/politics/2016/04/06/82730214/\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nDemocracy underway below the canal\n\nAt the Sunnyside Elementary polling site in Smyrna, Darrell Birl said he was most interested in the 29th District representative race. Birl said he wanted to vote “to ensure that our representation is what we want it to be on the issues we find important.”\n\nFor Manuel Green, the race for Delaware’s next chief executive topped his priorities.\n\n“I want to help decide our new governor. That’s what I’m focusing on,” Green said.\n\nVoting is important to him “because I recently talked with an older person who told me how they struggled to vote. It wasn’t easy back in their day. Because of their struggle, I have a voice and I’m going to use it by pushing that button.”\n\nTurnout was light. There wasn’t a line. From 7 to 7:30 a.m., 11 people entered the school.

This means you can only vote for candidates in your own party on primary day. Some people think this is lame.\n\nAnd, also unfortunately, the Mandalorian contingent in Delaware has yet to run a candidate, which I think we would all love to see come the next round of elections. This is the way.\n\nYou can have a look at how many people are registered to various political parties and funnies here.\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nSpeaking of closed primaries:\n\nPrimary day always reminds me of the time then-Wilmington mayoral candidate Mike Purzycki, a Democrat in registration, rallied a bunch of city Republicans to change their registration to Democrat ahead of the 2016 primary.\n\nPurzycki ended up winning that primary by a slim margin in an overloaded field of eight candidates. Today, sitting Gov. John Carney is vying to replace Purzycki in the Democratic primary against Velda Jones-Potter.\n\nIf you want to take a spin down memory lane, here was some coverage of the great Wilmington Republican swap from back in the day.\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhy can I not register to vote on election day?\n\nIn Delaware, you can't register to vote and actually vote on the same day. The deadline to register to vote for today's primary was Aug. 17.\n\nYou might ask: why?\n\nDelaware is among about half the states in the U.S. that don't allow same-day voter registration. They have tried, however.\n\nThe General Assembly in 2022 passed legislation that would allow for such as part of numerous efforts in recent years to make voting easier. Conservative interests have attacked those efforts in court and successfully saw the Delaware Supreme Court strike down the state's same-day voter registration law in 2022.\n\nSo if you see your buddies' cool \"I voted\" stickers today and are feeling left out, your next shot at a cool sticker is the general election in November.\n\nGranted, the general election is in many ways (and for some people) is less fun than the state primaries, but it is still part of the process. The deadline to register for that in Delaware is Oct. 12.\n\nRead more: Delaware's early voting, mail-in ballot rules reinstated with latest Supreme Court ruling\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is on the ballot?\n\nGet acquainted with your ballot before heading to the polls this morning with our guide to the 2024 primary here.\n\nYou'll find roundups of both the statewide and local races, as well as some deeper profiles on the gubernatorial candidates.\n\nVOTING:Your guide to the 2024 primary election\n\nAdditionally, you can find the League of Women Voters guide here − input your address and it will help you find the races you'll get to vote on.\n\nWhat you need to know before heading to the polls this morning\n\nWe rounded up some important details about voting in Delaware's primary.

The ceiling fans stir a soupy air around folks catching up with each other, and lining up for a chow selection of cornbread, fried fish and baked beans.\n\nMcGrath, a Democratic first-time candidate, talks about courage in Congress, laudable leadership and solemn service. Never once does she mention the name of her Republican opponent: three-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Andy Barr.\n\nDon Sturgeon, a Franklin County magistrate, wants to know if McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, attended the Naval Academy with a former student of his. She didn't, but the two strike up a conversation about the splash park at Lakeview named after him.\n\n\"Oh, is that right?\" McGrath asks. \"I love those things, and my kids absolutely love 'em.\"\n\nShari Thompson, owner of My Old Kentucky Om, a yoga studio, hugs McGrath and tells her that friends from New York City think her story — as a mom and a veteran — is an inspiration for women across the country.\n\nVoter guide:Kentucky's congressional candidates in the midterm election\n\n\"When I tell my friends she landed on those aircraft carriers, she was that person, you better have some confidence when you're bringing in a plane that fast,\" Thompson says.\n\nMcGrath, 43, strolls through a half hour of small talk before she reaches the front of the pavilion where a standing microphone and roughly 400 eager listeners await.\n\nFor McGrath and her team, this nationally watched horse race is more than a bellwether for Democrats seizing the House or giving the state party momentum ahead of next year's race for governor.\n\nThe 6th Congressional District — stretching across 19 counties in central Kentucky with a progressive urban core — is an experiment for whether a social liberal can win over rural Trump voters by emphasizing decency over ideology.\n\nMcGrath, who flew 89 combat missions, stands to the right of a staffer, squeezing her fingers, popping her knuckles and rubbing her palms when roaring applause breaks out.\n\n\"This election is about the soul of our country,\" she says.\n\nShe tells those gathered that issues like expanding affordable health care matter, but that anyone could be there talking about those things.\n\nWhat’s at stake in 2018 is deeper, she says, and it’s a not-so-subtle jab at the commander-in-chief.\n\n“It's about who we are as Americans, what kind of country we want to live in, what kind of Kentucky we want to have, what types of leaders we will accept,” McGrath says. \"It is about leadership ... not somebody who's divisive, not somebody who lies constantly but somebody who tells the truth even when it's hard to hear.\"\n\nMcGrath talks up community values, and how working together matters more than who you supported in the election. That's where her husband, Erik, a veteran and registered Republican, comes into the speech.\n\nThough her household may be politically divided, the couple cooperate to raise three children and get things done. That day-to-day experience shapes McGrath's view of the country, and mirrors how she wants to represent Kentucky in Congress.\n\nScorecard:Barr and McGrath answer 5 key questions for Kentucky voters\n\n\"My husband did not vote for the president, but for me, I understand why people voted for President Trump, and I’m not going to judge anyone’s vote,\" McGrath says in a brief interview afterward.\n\n\"Going forward, I’m presenting the fact that I believe the incumbent in the seat is unable — unwilling — to stand up to the president in any way shape or form. When the president has a good idea, I want to be with him, but he doesn’t have a whole lot of them.\"\n\nThis race is also a question of whether that commitment to civility and the avoidance of the usual attack ads can overcome the typical political strikes that would normally spell doom for a progressive running in central Kentucky\n\n“I'll tell you what's going to win this thing: It ain't commercials,” McGrath tells the crowd.\n\nNational divide looms over district\n\nA day after McGrath’s meet-and-greet in Frankfort, Barr is back in the district’s urban center of Lexington. President Donald Trump is set to arrive two days later for a Make America Great Again rally.\n\nBarr waddles a tight row of chairs inside a conference room at Voices of Hope. He shakes hands with members of the drug recovery center's board after a private 30-minute discussion on Kentucky’s opioid crisis.\n\nAlex Elwick, the group’s co-founder, and Van Ingram, the state’s drug czar, negotiate with Barr about where each should stand to take questions.\n\n\"I want to say I'm so grateful to our community partners, and policymakers, especially the man standing beside me,\" says Elswick, who got hooked on pain pills when his wisdom teeth were removed.\n\nBarr, 45, straightens his back when reporters, some from as far as Canada, Germany and Norway, turn their questions to him. The first is about the negative attacks ads against McGrath.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker swats away that inquiry to say that Kentucky’s opioid epidemic should be the day's focus, and that his office helped secure $2.62 million in grant money last year for similar organizations to expand their treatment services.\n\n“If you do the job you’re elected to do, the politics should take care of itself,” Barr said. “And what this is about is doing the job.”\n\n'We both served':Andy Barr compares politics to veteran's career\n\nBarr shakes a few more hands before he steps outside as a spitting rain subsides. He hands off his cup of coffee to a staffer and blows his breath into his cupped hands before calling on the same reporter who asked about the attack ads.\n\n“It is altogether fair and legitimate that my constituents see my opponent in her own words when she’s at a fundraiser in Massachusetts with her liberal donors, when she says she’s further left, more progressive, than anyone in this state,” Barr says.\n\nBarr, a former deputy general counsel for Gov. Ernie Fletcher, wants these contrasts going into the final weeks of the campaign, which polling shows is essentially tied. He has agreed to appear at as many as seven debates and forums to spar with McGrath on abortion, health care and the economy. She has agreed to only one.\n\nAfter the gaggle of reporters left, Barr used a more than 30-minute interview with the Courier Journal to defend his record and pounce on her. He touts the economic growth under a GOP-controlled Congress while keeping a safe distance from President Trump’s style.\n\n“My philosophy is I represent my district, I don’t represent a president,” Barr said.\n\n“I don’t agree with everything the president says or the way he says it all the time, but I am very supportive of the policy agenda of this president, and I think he’s done a great job.”\n\nBarr and outside groups have pummeled McGrath, reminding voters about her opposition to the GOP tax plan and support for abortion. He has repeatedly said she supports terminating a pregnancy until the ninth month, which McGrath vehemently denies.\n\nOne ad criticized McGrath as a “liberal feminist.”\n\nSome of the commercials have been slammed by fact checkers for being misleading, but they did chip away at McGrath's high favorability coming out of the primary election.\n\nMark Nikolas returned from political operative exile as a filmmaker to run McGrath’s campaign. He said his candidate won’t punch back. Instead, her responses will continue to be a mix of humor and a recounting of her military service and upbringing that's meant to keep viewers from rushing to the remote.\n\nMcGrath soared into Kentucky politics with a YouTube ad last year that drew 1.8 million views. In a bomber jacket with a fighter jet as the backdrop, she declared her candidacy.\n\nWhen Barr unleashed his attacks, she returned to the air strip where she leaned against a fighter jet asking Barr: “Seriously, is that all you got?\"\n\nYou may like:Rivals in competitive Kentucky race complain about 'misleading' ads\n\n\"The feeling is that Amy is in this race because she fundamentally believes we have lost civility and trust in our politics, and that there has been a deterioration,\" Nikolas said.\n\nStephen Voss, a University of Kentucky political scientist, said McGrath hasn’t followed the traditional playbook since entering politics last year. Rather than moving to the ideological center in the general election, he said she is focusing on the campaign's tone and connecting values of the district. McGrath often infuses her speeches and social media with commentary on how national decisions affect Kentucky's family farms, community banks and rural hospitals.\n\n\"On the ideology she's about as progressive as any other Democratic candidate, but what she's changed instead is the tone of the message,” Voss said.\n\nThat is important, he explained, because research suggests that rural voters feel the national Democratic Party — and liberals in general — look down on them culturally and are hostile to their way of life.\n\n\"What she's experimenting with is: Can a conventional Democratic message play in these places if brought to them by somebody who clearly respects their institutions and their way of life?” Voss said.\n\nAmerica First, Americans First\n\nBack on the campaign trail with McGrath, a food truck outside Bath County High School has finished frying its first few pounds of fish.\n\nA line snakes through the parking lot outside the basketball gym as campaign volunteers open the doors for a rally headlined by former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nMore below video\n\nThe two hit the stage with pep rally energy. Biden sits on a wooden stool as the whistles and hollers from the crowd echo through the gymnasium.\n\nMcGrath explains to the roughly 2,200 people who'd waited for hours in the frigid fall weather to hear the pair why she is a Democrat.\n\n\"It's because leaders in our Democratic Party changed a law that I cared about,\" she says.\n\nAs a seventh-grader, McGrath wanted to become a military aviator. She visited an Air Force museum, and without telling her parents asked the Naval Academy when women could fly fighter jets.\n\nMcGrath then contacted every member of the House Armed Services Committee asking for the change. She became the first woman to fly a F-18 fighter jet in combat.\n\nSee also:Donald Trump blasts Amy McGrath as an 'extreme liberal' in Kentucky\n\n\"When this law was changed it allowed me the opportunity to compete for a job that I wanted,\" McGrath says. \"I didn't ask for special treatment, I just wanted a chance, and if I was good enough, if I was qualified, then I could do that job.\"\n\nMcGrath pledged before the audience that her campaign would go beyond urban Democratic strongholds in Frankfort and Lexington. She said she has a presence in each of the district’s 19 counties, and has written a weekly editorial in their local newspapers explaining her views.\n\n\"My husband and I, we are not Democrat or Republican first. We are Americans first,” she said in a line that drew sustained cheers.\n\nBiden's folksy delivery played up his connections to Kentucky: he joked that he once worked for former U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford, who served as Democratic whip, and played up how his sister-in-law is from Owensboro.\n\nBut his purpose in coming to the town of Owingsville, where Democrats outnumber Republicans but have trended toward the GOP in recent years, is to remind white working class voters where their economic interests should be. He warned that after passing a massive tax cut the Republicans would target entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security to pay down the deficit.\n\nBiden, a possible 2020 presidential contender, also delivered what national observers said was his sharpest criticisms of Trump to date.\n\nScorecard:Yarmuth, Glisson answer 5 key questions for Kentucky voters\n\n\"He is just trashing American values the way he talks about people, the way he makes fun of people, the way he denigrates folks,” Biden said.\n\nPresident Trump returned that political fire when he parked Air Force One in Richmond the next day. His crowd of roughly 6,100 packed into Eastern Kentucky University's alumni coliseum — plus thousands more who couldn't get in — easily dwarfed McGrath’s event.\n\nThe mass of red Make America Great Again ball caps bobbed at Trump's adoration for Kentucky and dire warnings of a potential Democratic takeover.\n\n\"Who is he running against?” Trump taunted during his speech. “An extreme liberal chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters — that’s a real beauty — and the radical Democratic mob.”\n\nBarr and the entire Kentucky Republican power structure, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reminded voters that giving up their House majority could spell disaster for Trump's agenda. The president said it could endanger their very lives.\n\n\"Democrats want to open America’s borders and turn our country into a friendly sanctuary for murderous thugs from other countries who will kill us all,\" Trump said.\n\nMore below video\n\nTrump piggybacked on the congressman's attacks. He said McGrath favors a \"socialist takeover\" of health care and higher taxes.\n\nThe name-calling and hot blooded accusations didn’t change McGrath’s style. She responded: “Mr. President, you clearly don't know me. Yet.\"\n\nThe thick skin that serves McGrath well in the face of mocking political attacks by the country's leader is rooted — like much of her biography — in her military service.\n\nAviators, she says, are referred to by their call signs rather than their first names during their service. The squadron picks those nicknames usually based on a pilot's screw-up, \"or just the whims of the mob of pilots,\" she says.\n\nMcGrath's was \"Krusty\" as in the clown character from the TV cartoon show \"The Simpsons.\" She says it came from the way her curly hair stuck out the sides of her flight suit cap.\n\n\"I did not appreciate the name Krusty at first,\" McGrath tweeted in March. \"In fact, I hated it, which of course sealed the deal for it to become my official call sign. Over the years, I have begun to embrace ‘Krusty' (as I've heard much worse call signs given to others). So there you go.\"\n\nA tough exterior and appeal to shared civic values may not be enough, however, to win over a district that has a deep blue nugget surrounded by increasingly conservative suburban and rural voters that Trump carried by 15 percentage points and delivered Barr a comfortable 22 percentage point re-election in 2016.\n\nRelated:Matt Bevin hit with ethics complaint for promoting U.S. Rep.

This is an extremely life-threatening situation and residents in those areas should follow advice given by local officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so.\"\n\nSome weakening is forecast before the hurricane reaches the coast but Milton is still likely to be a \"large and powerful hurricane\" when it makes landfall, according to hurricane center specialist Jack Beven. The center warned that residents in warning areas should complete preparations, such as protecting life and property, by Tuesday night.\n\nRainfall is expected to total 5-10 inches in some areas of the state that were saturated even before Hurricane Helene smashed ashore less than two weeks ago. Isolated communities could see 15 inches, the hurricane center said. Some areas will be slammed with heavy rainfall well ahead of Milton's arrival, likely later on Tuesday through Wednesday night, the NHC said. A potentially deadly storm surge of 10-15 feet is possible for Tampa and other coastal communities.\n\nHurricane Milton tracker:Follow projected path of Category 3 storm expected to hit Florida\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ By late Monday, Milton was moving near the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, which was expected to see damaging hurricane-force winds and a life-threatening storm surge with destructive waves through the night.\n\n∎ Milton was centered 630 miles southwest of Tampa as of 11 p.m. ET, moving east at 9 mph. The storm's path places the center of the cone of uncertainty in the Tampa Bay area.\n\n∎ The White House said President Joe Biden has been briefed on preparations for Milton's arrival and on the ongoing response and recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene.\n\n∎ The hurricane center has raised potential storm surge heights in some locations and extended warnings northward along the Atlantic Coast. Storm surge is expected along the eastern Florida Panhandle and south through the Florida Keys, with as much as 15 feet in Tampa Bay.\n\n∎ Tampa International Airport will suspend flight operations at 9 a.m. Tuesday and \"reopen when safe to do so.\" The airport is not a shelter for people or vehicles, authorities said. The Orlando International Airport said it would suspend commercial and private flights Wednesday morning.\n\n∎ California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced 144 state firefighters and other emergency workers will deploy to Florida to help with search and rescue efforts expected to be necessary when Milton hits. The California first responders are just the latest to be sent across the country to help with emergency efforts. Newsom sent 151 firefighters and rescue personnel in the wake of Helene.\n\nMilton one of the 'most intense Atlantic hurricanes' on record\n\nMilton became one of the top five \"most intense Atlantic hurricanes\" on record Monday night, according to the National Weather Service in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. ET, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Hunters measured a minimum central pressure of 897 mb for Milton — making the hurricane the fifth most intense hurricane in the Atlantic basin by barometric pressure.\n\nWilma (2005): 882 mb Gilbert (1988): 888 mb Labor Day Hurricane (1935): 892 mb Rita (2005): 895 mb Milton (2024): 897 mb\n\nAccording to the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association, barometric pressure is the \"pressure exerted by the atmosphere at a given point.\" The lower the barometric pressure, the more intense the winds and the storm are.\n\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter for the news you need to know.\n\nLower wind speeds no consolation, hurricane expert says\n\nOne seemingly encouraging aspect of Milton’s frightening development is forecasters’ belief the hurricane’s intensity will diminish before reaching Florida’s west coast, from its current Category 5 to perhaps a Category 3.\n\nJamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, said that’s actually not good news.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Rhome said Milton’s winds may decrease from the current 180 mph – they could conceivably dip below the 130 mph threshold for a Category 4 storm – but at the same time the hurricane will get bigger and become more damaging.\n\n“We saw this in Helene,’’ Rhome said. “These big storms, these large-size storms, produce more impact. So this growth in size is going to more than compensate for the reduction in intensity, and it’s going to cause problems because you’re going to get a broader swath of impact, and then things like storm surge are actually made much worse by the bigger size.’’\n\nRhome pointed out the west side of the Florida peninsula is particularly susceptible to storm surge, as was evidenced late last month by the impact of Helene even though it only delivered a glancing blow to the area. The one-two combination of both major hurricanes so close to each other could be “crippling,’’ he said.\n\n“This case it’s going to be a direct impact, a direct shot, and more powerful at that,’’ Rhome said. “So we’re going to have potentially catastrophic wind damage over a densely populated portion of the Florida peninsula. … Plus, the storm surge is going to be worse than we saw in Helene in some cases.’’\n\nWhen will Milton hit what city?\n\nThe Tampa region will be hit by Milton first, according to AccuWeather. Meteorologists say the hurricane will batter the coastal city from 8 a.m. Wednesday through 2 a.m. Thursday. Up to a foot of rain is expected with 140 mph winds and up to 15 feet of storm surge.\n\nMilton will hit Orlando around 12 p.m. Wednesday through 6 a.m. Thursday, AccuWeather said. Meteorologists forecast the hurricane's winds will slow to 120 mph - a Category 3 hurricane - but expect up to a foot of rain.\n\nThe storm is expect to slow as it heads north but reach Jacksonville with near hurricane-force winds, according to forecasters.\n\nVulnerable Tampa Bay area facing large storm surge\n\nThe Tampa Bay metro area has been deemed the nation's most vulnerable to storm surge, and now it's facing a potentially deadly calamity that could inflict more than $200 billion in damage.\n\nHurricane Milton, now at Category 5, is on track to smash into the region Wednesday and bring a storm surge of up to 15 feet. Some key factors could change before then, including the hurricane's path and level of intensity as it encounters wind shear. But the possibility of large parts of the area being flooded with seawater, perhaps the worst such inundation in more than a century, is very real.\n\n\"A severe storm with the right track orientation will cause an enormous buildup of water that will become trapped in the bay and inundate large areas of Tampa and St. Petersburg,'' said a 2015 report from the risk-modeling firm Karen Clark & Company. \"Fifty percent of the population lives on ground elevations less than ten feet.''\n\n− Doyle Rice, Janet Loehrke and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nResident of eastern Florida coast 'apprehensive'\n\nSamuel Eames spent the weekend buying batteries and canned food as Hurricane Milton formed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEames, 70, lives just a few miles from Flagler Beach on the eastern coast of Florida. The longtime resident said it's rare for his community to experience hurricane-force winds from the west, but considering Milton’s power, he’s concerned about the potential damage.\n\n“The weather guys here have been on the air for 20-25 years, and they said they have not dealt with a storm this powerful,” Eames said. “They're not kidding around.”\n\nOn Monday, the Navy veteran and retired construction manager said he intends to pick up prescriptions and buy a pair of knee-high boots before hunkering down in his home.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Helene, swaths of the state have faced rounds of thunderstorms. In Eames’ neighborhood, standing water could be seen “pretty much everywhere,” he said. Forecasters project 6 to 12 inches of rain falling over Flagler and several surrounding counties through Thursday.\n\n“I'm not going to say that I'm worried, but I'm a little apprehensive,” Eames said.\n\nShould there be a Category 6 for new turbocharged hurricanes?\n\nIs there such a thing as a Category 6 hurricane? Not at the moment, but the topic has been discussed.\n\nThe long-used Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale starts at 74 mph for a Category 1 storm and goes up to Category 5 for any hurricane with sustained wind speeds of 157 mph and above.\n\nThe stunningly fast rise of Milton’s wind speeds – increasing by 130 mph to the current 180 mph in 36 hours – has once again raised the question of whether there should be a new category for turbocharged hurricanes. The only five storms known to have produced wind speeds of at least 192 mph – a possible threshold for a new category – have occurred in the last decade, as ocean temperatures have warmed in parts of the world.\n\nHowever, some weather experts would like to see wind speed categories deemphasized, saying they don’t adequately convey a hurricane’s broader potential impacts such as storm surge and inland flooding. That’s what caused most of the damage from Hurricane Helene in Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\n− Michael Loria and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nSignificant impact to beaches expected as Milton follows Helene\n\nFlorida's coastal area on the west, known for expansive beaches with fine, white sand, is likely to undergo significant change because of Milton, the U.S. Geological Survey said Monday.\n\nRoughly 95% of the sand beaches on that coast are forecast to be continuously covered by waters from the Gulf of Mexico because of the hurricane, causing both erosion and overwash from the water levels covering the tops of sand dunes, the geological survey said.\n\n“The significance of the coastal-change forecast for Milton’s impact to the Florida west coast cannot be overstated, as I believe communities are more vulnerable to this storm’s impacts due to the erosion that occurred recently from Helene,” said Kara Doran, a USGS supervisory physical scientist who works on the forecast.\n\nThe agency’s forecast is a worst-case scenario to help provide insight to emergency management officials.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nMom shifts into survivalist mode for Milton\n\nFor over a week, Elasa Tiernan has grappled with the flood damage to her home in Crystal Beach, in the Tampa Bay area. From hundreds of miles off shore, Hurricane Helene inundated Tiernan’s house in 2 feet of seawater. In the immediate aftermath, Tiernan’s husband – now bedridden because of mold exposure – cleared out the furniture and took a sledgehammer to the cabinets and concrete walls. Now, as Hurricane Milton approaches, one question haunts the lifelong Floridian: Will their home survive?\n\n“I was going to squeegee more water out today, but with this all coming again, we pretty much just had to throw in the towel,” Tiernan, 48, told USA TODAY by phone as she searched for gasoline.\n\nMost of her neighbors suffered the same fate during Helene, and now the streets are lined with “mountains of furniture.” On Monday, she bolted the doors shut, turned off the main breaker and headed for her aunt's house in Tarpon Springs, where she plans to shelter with her husband and daughter.\n\n“I’m going to make sure we have everything we need. I'm a survivalist, I guess,” Tiernan said. “Being a mom of a 14-year-old, you don't really have a lot of time to think otherwise, right?”\n\nCategory 5s are the rarest hurricanes\n\nHurricane Milton is the second Category 5 storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, joining Beryl. Category 5 is the highest rating a hurricane can attain, according to the National Hurricane Center. Maximum sustained winds in excess of 156 mph or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale are required for a hurricane to reach this intensity.\n\nThey are the rarest of hurricanes: Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman said there have only been 40 such hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin since 1924, according to NOAA's historical database.\n\nSince 1950, only five other years have had at least two Atlantic Category 5 hurricanes, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach: 1961: Esther, Hattie; 2005: Emily, Katrina, Rita, Wilma; 2007: Dean, Felix; 2017: Irma, Maria; 2019: Dorian, Lorenzo.\n\nOnly four hurricanes have ever hit the U.S. at Category 5 strength; the most recent being Hurricane Michael in 2018.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nHow is Hurricane Milton impacting flights?\n\nFlights in the U.S. are not yet being affected by Hurricane Milton, but airlines and airports in the storm’s path are preparing for its impact. Carriers including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines have already begun issuing waivers that allow travelers going to or from some Florida airports to change their tickets beginning Monday for no extra charge, even if they purchased a basic economy fare. Customers can check their airline’s website for specific details on travel advisories.\n\nArea airports are open now but say they are monitoring the storm’s path and are prepared to close if necessary. Tampa International Airport said it will suspend operations beginning 9 a.m. Tuesday and will reopen “as soon as it is safe to do so later this week.”\n\nIf a flight gets canceled for any reason, customers are entitled to a refund, according to Department of Transportation rules. Travelers should keep an eye on updates from their airline and consider taking advantage of flexible change policies if they don’t have to travel.

The road to the dump was muddy and several cars had to be towed, said Pace, 52. Meanwhile, lines outside gas stations and supermarkets stretched for blocks as people rushed to pick up supplies.\n\nThe approach of Hurricane Milton has plunged Gulf Coast residents – many of whom already were mourning homes and even loved ones from Helene's rage – into a state of emergency, Pace said.\n\n“Maybe five minutes from our home, it looks like a war zone with furniture stacking the streets everywhere,” she said. “We're still in such a state of recovery.”\n\nFar from Florida, Helene cleanup marches on\n\nWhile Florida braces for Milton, Western North Carolina is still in heavy cleanup mode from Helene. Nearly 1,000 soldiers from Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are closely working with FEMA to distribute food, water and other desperately needed items, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said at a briefing. Soldiers are also helping clear emergency routes.\n\nThe National Guard has activated more than 6,100 guardsmen, hundreds of high water vehicles and dozens of helicopters and rescue boats from 18 different states, Ryder said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAfter Helene, bracing for Milton: 'We're just exhausted'\n\nDavid Green was expecting to meet Monday with an electrician for a damage estimate on his home, which Hurricane Helene flooded with 3.5 feet of water. Now, for the second time in less than two weeks, he’s again fortifying his home – this time for Hurricane Milton. Green and his wife live on St. Pete Beach, which along with Tampa Bay and surrounding coastal communities, is expected to receive 10-12 feet of storm surge this week.\n\n“We’re just exhausted,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nGreen said mounds of debris are still piled up on curbs and buildings are being dug out from under the sand Helene pushed on shore. The 62-year-old said while he’s resigned himself to more flooding, he is worried Milton’s powerful winds could turn the household items into projectiles and cause structural damage.\n\nEarly Monday, he rented a truck from Home Depot and packed it with plywood to cover his windows. He plans to wrap up work on the home by Monday night, pack up his fans and dehumidifiers and wait out the storm at his daughter’s home in Ruskin. In the meantime, he’s going to postpone his appointment with his flood insurance company.\n\n“Everything is already gone and out of the house,” he said. “We just have to shut the power off. Then we wait and see … hopefully we can come back.”\n\n'I apologize, this is just horrific': Meteorologist gets weepy talking about Milton\n\nMilton’s raging intensity brought one meteorologist to the point of tears on live television.\n\n“I apologize, this is just horrific,” said NBC 6 hurricane specialist John Morales, his voice cracking and choking back tears after delivering the latest scientific readings of the storm's acceleration.\n\nMorales, an atmospheric and environmental scientist, has four decades of experience as a meteorologist for the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration and TV stations, according to his LinkedIn.\n\n“The seas are just so incredibly, incredibly hot,” Morales said, watching Milton spin off the coast of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. “Global warming, climate change leading to this and becoming an increasing threat.”\n\nMorales' voice broke as he forecasted the impact Milton will have.\n\n“You’re going to find it very difficult for it to be nothing less than a major hurricane when it makes landfall in Florida,” he said.\n\nMorales' heartfelt show of sympathy for those in the storm's path earned him praise from several people on Youtube, with one user writing, \"When a weatherman . . . for the last 50 years starts tearing over a forecast, you know there's big problems coming.\"\n\n− Michael Loria\n\nMilton sees 'rapid intensification,' explodes to a Cat 4 in about 1 day\n\nMilton grew very strong very fast Monday in what meteorologists call \"rapid intensification,\" which is a dramatic rise in wind speed and a huge drop in barometric pressure in a short amount of time. The phenomenon, which appears to be more common with hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years, is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\n\nMilton more than qualified, exploding from a 60-mph tropical storm Sunday morning to a potent 155-mph Category 4 hurricane − an increase of 95 mph in little more than 24 hours.\n\nRapid intensification is most likely when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an \"extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach says. That typically means very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver and Doyle Rice\n\nDisney World not taking reservations for Tuesday, Wednesday\n\nWalt Disney World theme parks were still open to the public Monday. Disney, however, was not taking park reservations for Tuesday and Wednesday. Disney had posted a hurricane update on its Disney World weather updates and information page: “Walt Disney World Resort is currently operating under normal conditions. We are closely monitoring the path of the projected storm as we continue to prioritize the safety of our guests and cast members. To ensure you have a magical visit to Walt Disney World Resort, we encourage you to prepare for the local climate and check the weather forecast for Central Florida. Check back for important weather updates.\"\n\n− Jennifer Sangalang\n\nMandatory evacuation orders expected Monday\n\nPinellas, Manatee and Sarasota were among counties expected to announce evacuation orders Monday. Pinellas County, which includes the city of St. Petersburg, was planning to announce mandatory evacuations for 500,000 people in the low-lying areas, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Sunday. He urged people to heed evacuation orders after he said too many ignored them for Helene, resulting in 12 deaths in the county and 1,500 emergency calls that went unanswered.\n\nThe county already ordered the evacuation of six hospitals, 25 nursing homes and 44 assisted living facilities totaling 6,600 patients, said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management. School was canceled through Wednesday.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of Florida's emergency management division, said the state was preparing for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017, when more than 6 million Floridians were forced to flee their homes.\n\nFrom rescue to recovery:The grim task in flood-ravaged western North Carolina\n\nWhat does declaring a state of emergency in Florida mean?\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 51 of Florida's 67 counties ahead of Milton. Declaring a state of emergency allows the state and local governments more freedom to coordinate emergency agencies and relax restrictions.\n\nThe governor may suspend regulations that would slow emergency response, commandeer private property needed to deal with the emergency, order evacuations, and direct or delegate control of the National Guard to help rescue or cleanup operations. DeSantis also could suspend the sale of alcohol, guns, explosives and combustibles, establish emergency housing, limit power services as needed, and impose or allow exceptions to curfews.

He carried the state by about 3.5 points.\n\nArizona was the first state to flip in the presidential race though several key swing states remained up in the air Wednesday morning.\n\nNationwide, Trump and Biden each claimed early and predictable state calls, with Trump projected to win Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and North and South Carolina. Biden locked down a slew of blue states in the Northeast, including his home state of Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.\n\nBut votes were still being tallied in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, that will ultimately determine the election.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n1 a.m.: Mark Kelly defeats Martha McSally in Senate race\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly defeated Republican Martha McSally in Arizona's U.S. Senate race with national implications, according to The Associated Press.\n\nKelly, a first-time candidate, is a retired NASA astronaut, gun-control advocate and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.\n\nHe will fill the remainder of late Sen. John McCain's term and is expected to be sworn in as soon as election results are certified.\n\nA McSally campaign spokesperson signaled after the race was called that McSally, who was appointed to the seat in 2018, was not giving up on the race.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of votes have still not been counted,\" Caroline Anderegg said in a written statement. \"Every Arizonan deserves to have their voice heard and voted counted. We continue to monitor returns.\"\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n12:50 a.m.: Trump declares early victory, despite many votes outstanding\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was sweeping most battleground states and was well on his way to victory during remarks early Wednesday at the White House.\n\nHowever, he sought to sow distrust in the vote-counting process in several key swing states, repeating many false claims about how elections work.\n\nHe said his team was gearing up for a big celebration after winning states like Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas when “it was all called off.” He said he hasn’t been declared a winner in many of those states though he is leading by a wide margin that Biden can’t overcome.\n\nEarly results show Trump is leading Biden in crucial swing states, but there are many votes left to count.\n\nTrump said he planned to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent states from counting outstanding ballots late into the night, which he called a “fraud.”\n\nHowever, in Arizona, where he is trailing Biden by several points, Trump said it was too soon to call the race. He said there were many votes left to count and that he shouldn't be discounted yet, contradicting his comments about other swing states with large number of outstanding votes where he has falsely claimed he had won.\n\nHe said it would’ ve been “nice” to win but that winning Arizona wasn’t necessary to getting elected to a second term.\n\n— Rachel Leingang and Paulina Pineda\n\n12:30 a.m.: Dem grassroots groups celebrate possibility of turning Arizona blue\n\nVotes were still being counted in Arizona when cheers erupted from community organizers in south Phoenix who declared they were turning the state blue.\n\nDown-ballot victories for Democratic candidates in the traditional Republican stronghold were celebrated as “vindication of all the pain and suffering we’ve seen in the community.”\n\nActivists from the Unite Here labor union, CASE Action social justice group and Living United for Change grassroots organization applauded voter drives that they said helped bring thousands of young voters to the polls in 2020.\n\nOrganizers outside the CASE Action offices on Seventh Avenue just before 11 p.m. said just “showing up” was a victory.\n\n“Never in my life did I think we would be up in the air here in Arizona,” said Marisela Mares, 22, referring to a presidential election that was too close to call. “It could be a very close race. We’re pushing that margin.”\n\nMares, who started organizing with Unite Here eight years ago at 14, said Arizona has evolved from a red state in 2010 to a purple state in 2018 to a blue one on Tuesday night. Organizers for years have made a determined effort to convince Hispanic and young voters that they could make a difference, Mares said.\n\n“I think it’s a lot more blue than we were, even just two years ago,” Mares said. “I don’t know what color is between blue and purple, but we are there.”\n\nUnite Here organizer Maria Hernandez said union members, primarily hospitality workers, many of whom have lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, blitzed the state since June, knocking on as many as 800,000 doors.\n\n“The fact that we got to this point in Arizona is no accident,” she said. “We are instilling hope where there was once fear.”\n\nTuesday’s results proved when the community comes together, it can speak with a powerful voice, said Stephanie Maldonado, campaign director for Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA.\n\n“We were told, ‘Latinos don’t show up.’ But Latinos showed up,” she said. “We showed up, we voted early and we trusted a system. It was 10 years in the making; 10 years to get to today, 10 years to ensure our voices, our families and our communities were represented.”\n\nMaldonado said the movement was led by people under 30. She said they were motivated by anger over SB 1070, Arizona’s notorious immigration measure passed in 2010, which targeted undocumented immigrants with some of the strictest laws in the country.\n\n“Young people showed up and represented in Arizona,” she said. “Why? Because 10 years ago, we couldn’t vote. Ten years ago, we saw our parents and our community impacted by SB 1070, and tonight young people showed up and we won.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n11:45 p.m.: 2 people say they couldn't vote after being kicked out of vote center\n\nTwo siblings say they were among a small group of voters denied a vote and removed by law enforcement from a vote center in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday evening despite being in line by the 7 p.m. cutoff.\n\nIt was one of only a few allegations of voters being turned away from polling sites in Arizona as of Tuesday night, and the only one involving law enforcement.\n\nTimitria Thompson, 22, and her 24-year-old brother, Adrion Thompson, told The Republic that they were in line at 7 p.m. when they were asked to leave a polling place near Seventh and Southern avenues because it had closed.\n\nThe siblings said they insisted on being allowed to vote but that a man running the polling location kept trying to kick them out and eventually called police.\n\nAt least four Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to the scene and threatened to arrest Timitria Thompson on suspicion of trespassing and disorderly conduct, she said.\n\nAfter waiting in the polling place for more than an hour, Timitria Thompson said law enforcement eventually pushed her out.\n\nA Sheriff's Office spokesperson confirmed deputies were at the scene but said they \"did not take any law enforcement actions.\" A Phoenix Police Department spokesperson said the Sheriff's Office called Phoenix police to the scene but no arrests were made.\n\n— Chelsea Curtis\n\n11:20 p.m.: County Recorder Fontes says voting went without a hitch\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes told The Republic after polls closed Tuesday that voting went \"very, very well.\"\n\nA couple dozen locations had long lines after polls closed, but workers got them in and out quickly, he said.\n\nThroughout the day, very few voters had to wait more than 45 minutes.\n\nThere were a few snafus, he said, including some printers that ran out of ink. But those problems were addressed quickly.\n\n\"All in all, very positive feedback from the vast majority of voters that we had contact with,\" he said. \"I think this system worked very well.\"\n\nAbout 167,000 voters in Maricopa County cast ballots in person on Tuesday. That doesn't include people who dropped off signed and sealed ballots at the polls.\n\nThe county said it will continue to update election results throughout the night until all ballots cast in person on Tuesday are counted. Ballots that were dropped off will be verified and counted later in the week.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n11 p.m.: Joe Biden says he's 'confident about Arizona'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke to a car rally in Wilmington, Delaware, about 10:40 p.m. Arizona time on Tuesday, telling the crowd to be patient and expressing confidence that his campaign would prevail.\n\n“We're confident about Arizona. That's a turnaround,” Biden said.\n\nHe stressed the importance of counting all votes before declaring a winner.\n\n“We're gonna have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished, and it ain't over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted,” Biden said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted, without evidence, that he was winning big and that “they” were trying to “STEAL the Election.”\n\n“We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” he wrote.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n10:45 p.m.: Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel admitted to hospital\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Allister Adel was taken to the hospital for a health emergency, Jennifer Liewer, the office’s spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nInformation on Adel’s condition is limited at this time and “the situation is fluid.”\n\n“We ask for the community's thoughts and prayers at this time,” Liewer said.\n\nEarlier this evening, Adel’s campaign told The Republic, the county attorney was waiting for the first round of results at home with her family.\n\nDemocratic challenger Julie Gunnigle leads Adel in early returns in the Maricopa County attorney's race.\n\nGunnigle wrote on Twitter that she wished Adel “a full recovery.” She found out about the health emergency online.\n\n“My thoughts are with Allister and her family,” she wrote.\n\n— Lauren Castle\n\n10 p.m.: Mark Kelly speaks in Tucson\n\nAt an event in Tucson, Democrat Mark Kelly told supporters he is confident that he will defeat incumbent U.S. Sen. Marth McSally when all of the votes are counted.\n\n\"We're going to be successful in this mission,\" he said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n9:45 p.m.: AZ Republicans, Democrats hold election night events\n\nNearly 200 members of the Arizona Republican Party gathered Tuesday night for an election result watch party, at least half decked out in Trump gear.\n\nThe invite-only event started at 7 p.m. in a courtyard near the intersection of Arizona Avenue and Boston Street in Chandler.\n\nState Treasurer Kimberly Yee opened the night.\n\n“So many of you have been a part of our movement of knocking on doors and getting people out there to vote, thank you,” Yee said.\n\nSupporter Denise Phillips praised the president’s work with the economy.\n\n“I went to his last rally in Goodyear,” Phillips said, “It is just amazing … I have never seen anyone draw that type of energy. He is such a rock star.”\n\nAlthough Phillips is extremely supportive of the president, she admitted to having doubts about him securing the presidency for a second term.\n\n“I knew in my heart in 2016 that he was going to win, but now I’m a little more worried,” Phillips said.\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Party leaders erupted with cheers at a watch party in Phoenix as initial county vote totals that dropped at 8 p.m. showed Democrats with sizable leads in key races.\n\nSome shouted, “Oh my god!” multiple times as they scrolled down the Maricopa County Recorder Office’s website, which showed Joe Biden and Mark Kelly leading the vote in the county while Democrats led in the county races for attorney, sheriff, recorder and assessor.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes lauded the county’s high voter turnout.\n\n“Even though there might still be a couple people in line here — by the way, stay in line if you’re in line and vote — we created a system that makes it very, very easy,” Fontes said. “In fact, it is so easy to vote in Maricopa County, that we’ve got record numbers even during a global pandemic.”\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Chair Steven Slugocki said the state’s most populous county would transform the state from the Republican stronghold it once was.\n\n“Tonight, we made history in Maricopa County by turning this county blue,” Slugocki said. “Maricopa County is going to lead the way to Arizona turning blue. We are no longer a red state in Arizona.”\n\n— Katelyn Keenehan and Perry Vandell\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona returns 7 US House incumbents, per AP\n\nThe Associated Press has called seven Arizona U.S. House races for incumbents.\n\nIncumbent Democrats Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick and Greg Stanton and incumbent Republicans Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and Andy Biggs will return to Congress.\n\nThe two other congressional races are too close to call.\n\nIn early returns, incumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in District 1 U.S. House race and Democrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Rep. David Schweikert in District 6 U.S. House race.\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona voters legalize marijuana, according to AP\n\nArizona voters approved a ballot measure to legalize marijuana, according to the Associated Press.\n\nProposition 207 will legalize possession of as much as an ounce of marijuana for adults 21 and older and set up a licensing system for retail sales of the drug, starting with the medical-marijuana dispensaries already operating in the state. Sales will begin in March under the measure.\n\nThe measure also allows people previously convicted of marijuana crimes, such as the felony charge for possession, to have their records expunged by the courts.\n\nAnd it establishes special \"social equity\" licenses for communities historically disenfranchised by marijuana laws.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n9 p.m.: Democrats have slight lead in race for 3 seats on Arizona Corporation Commission\n\nDemocrats are ahead in the first returns of the six-way race for three seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, which sets rates and policies for utilities in the state, including how much renewable energy they are required to use.\n\nEarly ballots counted and posted Tuesday in Arizona are thought to skew towards registered Democrats, with more Republicans showing up in person Tuesday to vote. While Democrats led, the margin between them and the Republicans was small.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n8 p.m.: Gallego, Ortega and Peterson lead in mayoral races\n\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego leads challengers Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay in early results.\n\nFormer council member David Ortega leads opponent Lisa Borowsky in the race for Scottsdale mayor, according to early election results.\n\nBrigette Peterson leads Matt Nielsen in the race for Gilbert mayor, according to early results.\n\n— Jen Fifield, Lorraine Longhi and Alison Steinbach\n\n8 p.m.: Julie Gunnigle leads Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race\n\nDemocrat challenger Julie Gunnigle leads County Attorney Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Paul Penzone leads Jerry Sheridan in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race\n\nIncumbent Democrat Paul Penzone leads Republican Jerry Sheridan, former deputy to Joe Arpaio, in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Tipirneni leads Schweikert in House race\n\nDemocrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Republican Rep. David Schweikert in early returns in U.S. House District 6 race.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: O’Halleran leads Shedd in House race\n\nIncumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in early returns in District 1 U.S. House race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Education Prop. 208 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 208, which would raise taxes on the wealthy to fund education in Arizona, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Marijuana Prop. 207 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Mark Kelly leads Martha McSally in early returns in Senate race\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly leads Republican Senator Martha McSally in early returns in the U.S. Senate race with national implications.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in Arizona early returns\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in Arizona early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n7:45 p.m.: Some lines remain after polls closed\n\nAbout 100 voters remained in line at Mesa Community College after polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\nVoters in line before 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast votes as long as they stay in line.\n\nCampaign volunteers and poll observers who were stationed at the site said voters were told that a ballot printing machine went down for about an hour and a half around 4:30 p.m., which caused a major backup.\n\nRandy Perez, a volunteer with Arizona Center for Empowerment, said he notified the county as soon as he heard about the issues with the machine, but it still took over an hour to fix.\n\n\"They should have fixed the machine faster or informed voters of other options,\" Perez said.\n\nA Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson said the ballot printer did not break, but was running slowly for about a half hour. She said the county deployed technicians who were able to get the machines running at a normal speed.\n\nAt 7 p.m., a poll worker called out the line to vote was closing. Sarai Soto, 34, walked up within a minute. The poll worker turned her away. A fight erupted between poll watchers, a man in line and the poll worker over the woman’s right to vote\n\nThe woman said that because of poor signage to direct voters to where to vote on the large campus she had spent 30 minutes looking for the polling place\n\n​She said she waited for about 20 minutes at another campus building with about four other voters also looking for the polling place\n\nShe said she’s Puerto Rican, and cares deeply about voting in this election.\n\n\"It was my first time voting. Now, I don’t get to vote,\" Soto said.\n\nThe line to vote at Surprise City Hall wrapped around the building and doubled back inside around 6:30 p.m. with more than 150 voters waiting to cast ballots. The line moved quickly, however, and there were only a few voters left waiting by 7:30 p.m.\n\nEdward Wagner, 58, a Republican with his two young daughters in tow, said his wait of more than an hour was worth it to vote for Trump and the GOP at all levels of office in “the biggest election of the century.”\n\nWagner criticized Democrats for disrespecting Trump, trying to block him at every turn and waging a “faulty impeachment” effort.\n\nSeeing violence rise in his hometown of Chicago and other cities led by Democrats turned him away from the party, he said.\n\nA former Peace Corps volunteer who met his wife in Africa, Wagner said he understands the problem of racial inequity but believes that Democrats haven’t succeeded in fixing it. He praised Trump for signing a prison reform bill and said he would support the president going further on the issue.\n\nAs a Catholic, Wagner said he opposes abortion and believes in a traditional view of family, which he said Trump has a good record on.\n\nWagner said his family takes pandemic precautions seriously and he mourns the more than 230,000 dead, but he said with medical treatments improving, the country can’t afford more economic closures.\n\nTrump’s strength has been impressive, Wagner said.\n\n“He is as tough as nails. Just look at how he recovered from COVID himself, holding four rallies a day. He’s worked really hard,” Wagner said.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez and Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n7:30 p.m.: 2 downtown Phoenix businesses boarded up in case of protests\n\nAnticipating protests following Election Day results, at least two businesses in downtown Phoenix have taken precautions to protect their buildings.\n\nSnooze A.M. Eatery near Central Avenue and McKinley Street was seen boarding up its windows on Tuesday afternoon. According to Chris Lee, a Fix It Services manager, Snooze called the handyman company to board up their downtown location due to \"alleged riots.\"\n\nThe Wells Fargo location in downtown Phoenix also mounted wood boards over their exterior windows.\n\n\"We're just kind of closely monitoring things out of an abundance of caution and for the safety of employees and customers,\" said LiAna Enriquez, a Wells Fargo spokesperson in Phoenix. \"We're aware of concerns of the possibility of post-election demonstrations.\"\n\nThe downtown location is the only one in Arizona that will board up its windows, Enriquez said, because it is close to the Capitol where numerous protests were held over the summer.\n\n\"As a precaution, we are boarding windows of a small number of branch locations in select cities. Any branches that have been boarded are operating normally, unless they were already temporarily closed due to COVID-19,\" Enriquez said in a statement.\n\nPhoenix City Hall, which has also been a popular meeting spot for protesters this year, was not boarded up as of Tuesday evening, Phoenix Public Works Department spokesperson Yvette G. Roeder confirmed.\n\n\"However, the Public Works Department is prepared with materials, should the need arise,\" she said.\n\nSeveral Arizona Department of Public Safety vehicles were seen in the parking lot of the Arizona House of Representatives on Tuesday evening, but spokesperson Bart Graves said troopers will be staffed at \"normal levels\" on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department Headquarters was surrounded by barricades as it has been since protests began in downtown Phoenix in May after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nMaggie Cox, a Phoenix police spokesperson, said as of Tuesday evening, the department has \"additional officers mobilized\" and has been working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to \"ensure the safety of our community.\"\n\n\"While we have no information to indicate there will be criminal activity as a result of the election, we will continue to monitor activity related to demonstrations and responses will be determined by intelligence-driven information,\" Cox said. \"We also remind community members, 'If you see something, say something.'\"\n\n— Jamie Landers and Emily Wilder\n\n7 p.m.: Polls close in Arizona for anyone not already in line\n\nPolls have officially closed across Arizona. However, any voter who was in line at 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast a ballot.\n\nThe first batch of results are expected around 8 p.m. Those results will consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\nSubsequent reports later in the evening will include ballots cast at polling places on Election Day.\n\nMail ballots dropped off on Election Day must go through the same signature matching and curing process as all the other mail ballots. These ballots may not appear in the results for a few days.\n\n— Jessica Boehm and Andrew Oxford\n\n6:45 p.m.: Hiral Tipirneni thanks voters before polls close\n\nA little over an hour before polls closed, as a line of voters snaked through the campus of Paradise Valley Community College, congressional candidate Hiral Tipirneni stopped for one of the campaign’s final visits.\n\n“Thank you for voting,” Tipirneni told voters as they streamed past, her voice a little muffled by a bright pink mask that said “VOTE” in sparkling silver.\n\nA boy who looked old enough to vote told her he wasn’t. “Well, hopefully you’re with somebody who’s voting,” Tipirneni told him. “And in a couple years, you’ll be here to vote.”\n\nTipirneni, who is challenging Rep. David Schweikert in a close race, did not draw much attention. She stood outside the 75-foot electioneering boundary, hands folded at her waist, and thanked voters as they walked to the back of the line.\n\nFew voters seemed to recognize the candidate. She turned to a group of campaign staffers behind her. “They’re like, who is this woman?” she said, referring to the people walking past. “And why is she all dressed up to come to the polls?”\n\nA few minutes later, one of her staff walked off, and returned with a crisp white campaign sign. The staffer jammed the sign into the roots of a tree, and they headed to the next polling place.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n6:35 p.m.: Trump voters energized in Tucson\n\nAn enthusiastic group of nearly 20 Republican voters gathered in the Tucson suburb of Casas Adobes on Tuesday afternoon to show their support for President Donald Trump with a few hours remaining before polls close in Arizona.\n\nMany of these supporters said they chose to vote earlier in the day in person at the polls, taking cues from Trump, who has cast doubts on the safety of the vote-by-mail process despite no evidence of voter fraud.\n\n“I’m not going to send my mail, the ballot for president of the United States. That is too severe and it’s too important. So I went to a polling place because I know that it’s more secure and it’s harder to be thrown out,” said Joseph Abeyta from Tucson.\n\nThe diverse group of supporters waved flags and signs, with cars honking in support or in opposition at the intersections of Oracle and Ina roads. The group gathered in front in the Safeway plaza where in 2011 a gunman shot and injured former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, whose husband, Mark Kelly is on the ballot as the Democratic Senate candidate.\n\nThis precinct is part of the Republican suburbs that ring the heavily Democratic city of Tucson, and had some of the highest vote totals in Pima County for Trump in 2016.\n\nMelissa Shaw showed up to the rally with her 11-year-old daughter Trista after casting her ballot in person. She said her daughter was top of mind when she voted for Trump.\n\n“I want a strong economy. I want her to go to college and work for something. I don’t want her to go to college and think, ‘Oh, all of my debt is gonna be paid off.' I want her to go to college and pay for it and earn it,” she said.\n\nPima County skews heavily Democrat. But in the last month of the campaign Trump and Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Tucson on multiple occasions to boost turnout among his supporters in hopes of offsetting his projected losses in southern Arizona.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n6:30 p.m.: Youth excited to vote\n\nMohammed Mohammed, 23, of Tempe, voted for Joe Biden at Tempe Escalante Community Center.\n\nHe said he was driven to vote because he wanted to see racial justice and more education opportunities for young people.\n\n“The most important thing that matters for me is a president that’s going to help the students, help with education. Kind of solve the systemic problems that we have in America today,\" Mohammed said.\n\nMohammed is one of hundreds of thousands of young people across the country committed to making their voices heard this election.\n\n“All my friends are voting. The way that it was so crucial, especially for the year 2020, just made everyone vote,\" he said.\n\nMohammed said this election was the first time he took local elections seriously. He was eager to vote for Proposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, because he believes Arizona will benefit from taxing marijuana.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez\n\n6 p.m.: U.S. Postal Service misses order to sweep facilities for ballots\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service failed to meet a judge’s order on Tuesday for a sweep of its mail processing facilities in a dozen districts across the United States, including Arizona, to search for undelivered absentee ballots.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the sweep on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the NAACP and other groups after the Postal Service said about 300,000 ballots had not been scanned as delivered.\n\nOther postal facilities singled out for inspection include some in central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Detroit, Colorado/Wyoming, Atlanta, Houston, Alabama, northern New England, greater South Carolina, South Florida and Lakeland.\n\nSullivan, who is based in Washington, D.C., ordered the sweep for early Tuesday afternoon but the Postal Service said in a response it was “unable to accelerate\" its ongoing daily review process to conduct the sweep \"without significantly disrupting preexisting activities on the day of the election.”\n\nThe Postal Service said it is already conducting daily reviews of 220 facilities across the country handling election mail.\n\nRod Spurgeon, a spokesperson for the Postal Service in Arizona, said: “We do not currently have any issues impacting the timely delivery of ballots but will continue to monitor and be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nSullivan wrote Tuesday that he would let the Postal Service’s ongoing process continue but added the agency “shall be prepared to discuss the apparent lack of compliance with the court's order” during a hearing on Wednesday.\n\n— Andrew Oxford\n\n5:30 p.m.: Disparate views in Glendale\n\nPeople streamed steadily into the polling place at Glendale Community College in the mid-afternoon, but lines to vote in person were only a few minutes long, voters reported.\n\nFernando Cazares said equality for immigrants and LGBTQ people were key factors driving his vote for Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough he respects Trump voters, he said he generally disagrees with Trump's policies.\n\n“I want for everybody to be treated the same,” Cazares said.\n\nCazares, a 19-year-old caregiver, said it was his first time voting. He went to the Glendale Community College polling place on his day off with a friend to cheer him on who is an immigrant and could not vote.\n\n“This election is going to be one for the history books,” Cazares said. “It feels good. People went through a lot just to be able to vote. Being able to vote in itself is a privilege.”\n\nWearing a camouflage Army hat and standing in the shade as the afternoon temperature hit 90 degrees, Calvin Hamilton said he was proud to vote for a second time for Trump.\n\n“I wasn’t one of those silent voters,” Hamilton, 75, said. “I’m a Trumper.”\n\nThe military veteran said he likes Trump’s cuts to government and regulations.\n\n“He kept his word. When’s the last time you could say that about a president?” Hamilton said.\n\nThe election is “paramount to the future,” Hamilton said. “We have more government than we need.”\n\nRyker Martin, 28, a Glendale resident aiming to become a teacher, said he had become disillusioned with the political process after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so he cast a protest vote for president in 2020, writing in the \"Star Trek\" character Jean-Luc Picard.\n\n“I think the left-right dichotomy is built out of fear,” Martin said. “It’s the same thing every time. … I’m tired of the same old, same old. I don’t see the point of voting for any party.”\n\nMartin said he voted in favor of state propositions to legalize marijuana and to raise taxes on high-income earners to fund education, even though he worries some of the revenue raised for education will get wasted.\n\n“I’ve been in situations when I was in high school where we couldn’t even pay for paper, but we had people with six-figure salaries overloading the administration,” he said. “But the schools do need money, and if it’s going to keep them afloat until we can fix something about it, it’s the best I can do.”\n\n— Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n5:15 p.m. Some vote centers busy while neighboring locations quiet\n\nSome vote centers have seen long lines throughout the day, but locations just a few miles away from those sites have had no lines at all.\n\nVoters can check wait times and lines at locations.maricopa.vote.\n\nSurprise City Hall saw waits of 30 minutes or more throughout the afternoon. At about 5:20 p.m., the wait was about 51 minutes and there were more than 200 people in line. But just 2.4 miles away, R.H. Johnson Recreation Center in Sun City West reported no wait.\n\nMini Social, a location in downtown Scottsdale, also saw lines throughout the day. As of about 5:15 p.m., the wait was about 22 minutes and there were 69 people in line. Just 3 miles from there, Scottsdale Plaza Shopping Center saw a wait time of two minutes, with 10 people in line.\n\nAt the main voting location in Tolleson, Esther Angulo Community Center, the time to vote about 4:30 p.m. was about 38 minutes, with 122 people in line. About 2 miles away at Rio Vista School in Avondale, the wait was 2 minutes and there were 5 people in line.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n5 p.m.: Queen Creek voters allege voter harassment\n\nVoters at a Queen Creek vote center reported being harassed shortly before 1 p.m. by people who honked horns at them, yelled at them and tried to take their photographs.\n\nThe incident, which took place at a higher education complex called Communiversity, was reported to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office as well as to the Election Protection hotline run by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n“One of our field volunteers reported this issue and had the voter call into the hotline,” Election Protection spokesperson Ian Weiner said via email Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“We received this complaint and were able to mobilize our coalition to address and ultimately resolve the issue. We sent a team of trained de-escalators (called “Election Defenders”) and raised it to the Secretary of State who also alerted the county to get the matter resolved,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Recorder’s office said she heard that individuals had yelled at voters, but that if it occurred outside the 75-foot limit surrounding polling places it was not illegal.\n\nShe added that anyone outside the 75-foot limit was also allowed to photograph anyone going into or out of a polling place.\n\nShe said the office also received reports that people were telling voters outside the polling place that they should use ballpoint pens on their ballots instead of the Sharpie pens provided in the voting booths.\n\nVoters can use ballpoint pen in black or blue ink or a Sharpie, and vote centers use fine-tip Sharpies as they have the fastest drying ink. If ballpoint ink is not allowed to dry completely, it can smudge off onto the optical readers and spoil other ballots, according to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office.\n\nA plainclothes Maricopa County Sheriff's deputy was sent to investigate and found that a woman was handing voters ballpoint pens with a flyer urging them to not use sharpies. The woman was told to stop and agreed to leave. The spokeswoman said new optical reading equipment was brought to the site to ensure ballots were read correctly.\n\n— John D'Anna\n\n4:45 p.m.: Growing line in west Phoenix\n\nA line of about 40 people formed outside a west Phoenix vote center at Pendergast Early Learning Center in the afternoon.\n\nArizona State University criminal justice major Mario Torres, 21, was able to leave his shift at Amazon early to vote on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the company allowed employees three hours off to cast their ballots on Election Day.\n\nTorres said he felt that the presidential race was the most consequential on the ballot because, \"I don’t think who's in office right now is beneficial to our country.”\n\nHe said he's most concerned about racial injustice, environmental issues and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he's hopeful a new president will create change in those areas — even if it takes a while.\n\n\"Change probably takes a long time to happen, as we’ve seen. But having someone who is more humanistic will help our society,\" Torres said.\n\n— José-Ignacio Castañeda\n\n4:30 p.m.: Advocacy group alleges voter suppression\n\nMembers of the organization Mi Familia Vota reported that they have received complaints from Spanish-speaking voters across the country about threatening calls and false information intended to confuse and discourage them from voting.\n\n\"The reports we have received are about intimidation and false information that are causing confusion in our voters,\" said Eduardo Sáinz, state director of Mi Familia Vota in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our message is clear: We have until today at 7 p.m. to participate in Arizona and we want our community to come out and vote to see the change we are waiting for,\" he said.\n\nSáinz did not present evidence, but said the reports come from reliable sources in the community.\n\nHe said that there is a helpline in Spanish that is 888-VE-Y-VOTA for people to call and report any false information or threats received regarding the elections.\n\nMi Familia Vota is a national civic engagement organization that advocates for social and economic issues that affect the Latino community, from immigration to worker rights.\n\n— Javier Arce\n\n4:15 p.m.: Active voters in central Phoenix\n\nThe first time she was eligible to vote, Pricilla Galaviz let the election pass by.\n\nNot this time. The 22-year-old stopped by the Phoenix Union High School District Office vote center on her way to the gym to cast her first ballot, thinking the entire time of friends and family who didn’t have that option.\n\nShe wanted to represent her Latino community, like her friends with DACA status and her father, who’s a resident but not a citizen. Somebody needed to speak for them. Galaviz, who works as a medical assistant at a surgery center, believed her vote could help.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said. “I’m voting for them. For the people who can’t.”\n\nAsked to pick her most important vote, Galaviz said she couldn’t choose. She’d researched them all. The opportunity to vote at all felt “amazing,” she said.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said.\n\nRuth Steen, a Phoenix elementary school teacher, spends her days around young people, and she wanted them to see that voting is important.\n\n“If they could watch me go in and do it, maybe other people would walk in,” she said after casting a ballot in central Phoenix. “Maybe if I see more people actually going in, somebody will stop and go, ‘Oh, I should go vote.’”\n\nEspecially this year. Steen said she was particularly motivated to vote against President Trump — \"I don’t like his character\" — and for Proposition 207, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona.\n\nSteen said she’d done her research, and saw a benefit in the taxes that legalization would raise. “I heard the states that have done it have done very well, as far as getting money to go back to them,” she said.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n3:45 p.m.: Mixed turnout in northern Arizona\n\nThe sun finally broke through thunderstorm clouds around 3 p.m. outside a voting location at Flagstaff Mall, where a handful of people lined up to vote.\n\nIt was a quiet affair, people meandering in and out of the poll with their young children, on their way to class at nearby Northern Arizona University or as they headed into the mall.\n\nIn the parking lot, a car emblazoned with pro-Biden bumper stickers and painted “Every Vote Matters!” sat only a few spaces from a truck flying a \"Thin Blue Line\" flag. Eventually they both pulled away, their drivers returning from inside each wearing “I Voted!” stickers.\n\nEarlier in the day, about 40 people lined up in light rain outside a polling place at the Camp Verde Community Library. Thunder rumbled overhead, but most appeared to be in good spirits.\n\nAlana Lewis, 18, was excited to participate in her first election.\n\n“It’s time for a change,” she said, then shrugged. “It’s just a lot of chaos that happened this year and I’ve seen a lot of the president’s true side of who he is and how he runs things.”\n\nStill in high school, she became politically aware with the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, which began in 2016. As a Native American, she said witnessing Trump’s response to the peaceful demonstrations there was eye-opening.\n\n“It’s kind of discriminating. Why do people have to fight for human rights, you know?” she asked.\n\nWhile not their first election, this was the first time Susan and Jerry Bennett came to vote in person. They came because they wanted to participate directly in this historic moment.\n\nThe two retirees came to vote for “democracy, capitalism, not socialism,” they said.\n\nSeveral paces behind, Ron Bennett (unrelated) was less enthused about his choices. He asked with a laugh, “What are the lesser of two evils?”\n\nSeveral people in line around him laughed and nodded in lighthearted disillusionment.\n\n— Emily Wilder\n\n3:15 p.m.: 18 ballots stolen but returned to voters\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office announced that it believes 18 ballots were stolen out of individual mailboxes in Glendale late last week.\n\nIn a statement, the office said a resident found the ballots hidden under a rock near 99th and Glendale avenues and contacted the Glendale Police Department on Friday.\n\nThe Glendale Police Department shared a video of Brayan Ruiz, who said he found the ballots under concrete and rocks while at work at Rovey Farms. He kicked the rocks, saw they said something about elections, took a picture and sent it to his boss, who told him to bring them to the office and then they contacted Glendale police.\n\n\"I really have no information of who could have put them there, or how they got there. All I know is they were there and I took action and returned them to Glendale police,\" Ruiz said.\n\nInvestigators believe the mail-in ballots were stolen from individual mailboxes in a neighborhood just south of 107th and Northern avenues. The envelopes were still sealed.\n\nAttorney General's Office agents and Glendale police officers hand-delivered the ballots back to the registered voters over the weekend.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office said the motive for stealing the ballots is unclear. An investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the incident can submit tips to the Attorney General’s Election Integrity Unit online or email EIU@azag.gov.\n\nVoters can check the status of their ballots on the Arizona Secretary of State’s website.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n3 p.m.: 'A lemonade stand for democracy' in south Phoenix\n\nVolunteers from United Farm Workers — some coming from other states in the West to focus on swing-state Arizona — have been hitting the pavement for months reaching voters in south Phoenix.\n\nOn Tuesday, the culmination of their efforts is a voter information booth at El Reposo Park, the site of the \"Low Ridin' for Biden\" event on Sunday, one of the organization’s last hurrahs to mobilize voters.\n\nOrganizers prepared a single table with treats and water in a cozy south Phoenix neighborhood between Seventh Street and Central Avenue.\n\n“I would say, if anything, it’s a lemonade stand for democracy,” Elizabeth Strater, a UFW volunteer from California, said of the humble table. “Because this is a community that doesn’t feel represented, these are folks that may not know where they’re supposed to vote.”\n\nSo far, a little more than 35 people showed up to ask for information.\n\nCommunities like south Phoenix, which is home to some of the poorest neighborhoods in Phoenix and has the highest Black and Latino populations in the city, are often disproportionately affected by voter disenfranchisement. Often, the community is skeptical of candidates and information just doesn’t reach voters.\n\n“The majority of people do want to be engaged, they just don’t have the tools to be engaged,” said Ernie Flores, a UFW volunteer from Yuma. “There’s no perfect representation, as Cesar Chavez said. There’s no perfect democracy, but there is perfect participation.”\n\nHe said it seems possible that Arizona will turn blue because of its Latino population, if not now, then in the future. He said Trump’s message to Latinos was that he was against them right off the bat, and that encouraged Latino voters to vote against him.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n2:30 p.m.: Maricopa County approaches 100,000 voters\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said voter turnout in the county is in line with what officials expected, with about 99,000 voters casting ballots in person before 1:30 p.m.\n\nThat doesn't include other voters who dropped off their mail-in ballots at the polls.\n\nJordy and Alexis Berrelleza did just that.\n\nThe Phoenix siblings said they wanted to cast their first votes together. After their ballots arrived in the mail, Jordy, 19, walked his sister through the choices, explaining the options as simply as he could.\n\n“In a non-biased way,” he said, grinning under his black mask, but the siblings voted mostly the same way anyway.\n\nBefore Election Day, they thought about mailing in their ballots, but all the noise surrounding the integrity of the election changed their minds.\n\n“We felt like it was more secure to bring it in person,” Jordy said. So together they headed to the offices of the Phoenix Union High School District, where there was a steady stream of voters but no line.\n\nIn the end, Jordy said, they probably didn’t have any reason to worry.\n\n“It would’ve been the same,” he said of mailing in their votes, “because we just dropped it in a box.\"\n\n— Alden Woods and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n2 p.m.: Navajo voters cast ballots\n\nNavajo voters streamed into the Steamboat Chapter House in Steamboat, Arizona, to cast their votes in Apache county.\n\nSeveral election officials paced the grounds, instructing voters which line to stand in. There was a line to vote in Apache County for the national and state election, and a line for local Navajo Nation government elections.\n\nThe voting line for the county moved quickly and the local voting line had build up as more and more people turned out to vote.\n\nElection officials made sure people in line maintained social distancing, kept face masks on and knew about hand-washing stations. They also checked temperatures before voters entered the building.\n\nAndrew Simpson and his wife Bessie Yellowhair-Simpson, from Steamboat in northeastern Arizona, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for family members to arrive from Phoenix. They both voted early by mail, but as community leaders — Andrew is a former council delegate and Bessi is the chapter treasurer — they stick around every Election Day.\n\nBessie, who is up for reelection, said she is use to seeing food stands lined up against the fence to feed voters before they head into the polls, but they couldn’t do that this year. The Navajo Nation Board of Elections sent out a memo before Election Day advising against food stands or political tents due to the pandemic.\n\n“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” he said, and he’s been able to recognize most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”\n\nAndrew feels that both major political parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed that they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.\n\n“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,\" he said. He hopes in a few years it will only get better.\n\n“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Andrew said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”\n\n— Shondiin Silversmith\n\n1:30 p.m.: Advocates say Native American voters see problems at polling sites\n\nVolunteers say they've heard of issues at polling locations in Apache County.\n\nVolunteers with Native Vote said they’ve received reports from Native American voters witnessing problems at polling sites. Patty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights and trains volunteers to monitor polling sites for problems.\n\nShe said they’ve received reports that polling sites in Apache County, including in Chinle and Window Rock, did not open on time this morning. That means some voters may have had to wait or leave if they had to work.\n\nFerguson Bohnee urged voters who experience or witness violations of voting rights to contact the Native Vote hotline at 888-777-3831 so attorneys can document and investigate the complaints.\n\nFurther south, three members of the Arizona State University's Indigenous pageant royalty supported the Native Vote at Bapchule, a community in the Gila River Indian Community.\n\nMiss Indigenous ASU Lourdes Pereira is a member of the federally recognized Hia-Ced O'odham but is enrolled at Tohono O'odham Nation. Pereira, a double major in American Indian and justice studies, said that one issue important to her is ensuring Native people can access ballots and return them from remote tribal communities while avoiding COVID-19 exposure.\n\nThe tribe instituted drive-thru voting, which First Attendant Jolene Fernandez said was a boon for elders, because it kept them from close contact with poll workers.\n\nThe tribe was also conducting its own election for council and an initiative to change the tribal constitution in regards to tribal membership.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez, Debra Utacia Krol\n\n12:45 p.m.: Lines still long in Scottsdale, issues in Tucson\n\nLines in Old Town Scottsdale started growing shortly after the polling place at the Old Town venue Mini Social opened for voting Tuesday morning.\n\nBy the afternoon, the Maricopa County Recorder's Office website showed there were still dozens of people in line and wait times stretched upward of 20 minutes.\n\nLines at polling places across the Valley have moved smoothly throughout the late morning and early afternoon. Dozens of locations listed on the county recorder's website showed wait times between zero and 10 minutes.\n\nVolunteers say the police were called in Tucson on a man trying to influence voters to reelect President Donald Trump outside the Miller-Golf Links Library.\n\nRoger Dean, a registered Democrat, has been outside of the polling site since 7 a.m. with a sign that reads \"Democrats for Trump.\"\n\n“Two police officers showed up,” Dean said. “They had complaints of me standing here (intimidating) people.”\n\nHe added that he is allowed to be at the polling site as long as he is at the 75 feet marker.\n\nLeo Kresch, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Tucson, said she has also been at this polling location all day, and was there when the police were called.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Joshua Bowling\n\nNoon: Volunteers offer resources ahead of potential lunch rush\n\nVolunteers stood outside Valley polling places Tuesday morning as they waited for a potential surge of voters during the lunch hour.\n\nPromise Arizona was on-site at Mountain Park Health Center encouraging people to get out the vote. Some arrived in a white pickup adorned with red and blue streamers, American flags and \"Vote!\" written along the door.\n\nVolunteers and employees held banners in English and Spanish with the messages \"Vote today\" and \"Sí se puede.\"\n\n\"We are making sure voters are supported when they come cast their vote and if we see anything suspicious or anything that’s out of place we will help them and provide guidance,\" Manuel Gutierrez with Promise Arizona said.\n\nIn northwest Phoenix near 35th and Northern avenues, dozens of members of Unite Here Local 11, a labor union that represents 33,000 hotel and food service workers in southern California and Arizona, fanned out into the neighborhoods for one final day of knocking on doors.\n\n\"This is the day we are going to turn Arizona blue,\" Alex Sandoval, a Unite Here organizer and campaign field director, told the group before sending them out into the field.\n\nVoting-rights advocates said that in an election with historic turnout, voters who don’t speak English or experience other barriers to voting may struggle to reach help when they believe their rights are being violated. Chris Gilfillan, a director with the Arizona Center for Empowerment and Living United for Change in Arizona, was working with voter protection groups providing support in Spanish and other languages.\n\n\"Anyone can help reporting voting flags (problems) using the incident reporting form,\" he said.\n\nPatty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights. She urged people who experience or witness problems for Native American voters to call the Native Vote hotline or reach out to volunteers at polling sites.\n\nArizona political parties have provided hotlines to assist voters who only feel comfortable seeking help for potential violations from someone with their party of preference.\n\nVoter-assistance hotlines:\n\nNALEO ¡Ve y Vota!

Náñez, Megan Taros, Daniel Gonzalez\n\n11:30 a.m.: Religious polling places in the East Valley\n\nThe Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley in Scottsdale was one of two mosques serving as a polling location in Maricopa County this year. Around 40 people formed a line outside the mosque early in the day, but the line started moving quickly.\n\nVoter Cat Splete said it took her about a minute total to drop off her ballot. This is Splete’s first time voting in a presidential election. Climate justice is the key issue that moved her to vote, she said.\n\n“It goes into the environmental humanities — those who live in minority communities are always going to bear the brunt of those negative environmental factors,\" she said.\n\nMany voters at the center were not Muslim. That's because Muslims were encouraged to vote early this year, according to Ahmed Soussi, the interim director for the Council of American-Islamic Relation’s Arizona chapter.\n\nCAIR is a part of the One Arizona, a coalition that mobilizes and educates voters from marginalized communities. One Arizona said on Twitter they registered about 185,000 voters this year.\n\nThe Sun Lakes United Methodist Church in Chandler did not see large crowds Tuesday morning.\n\nTwo woman, who dubbed themselves “The Two Phyllises”, have spent the morning handing out fliers that they made for Republicans to help them narrow down their votes.\n\nPhyllis Lester, who already submitted her early ballot, said she came up with the idea for the fliers when she and her husband realized how many judges there were to choose from on their ballot this election.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy, Kelly Donohue\n\n11 a.m.: Complaint of man in Trump mask yelling at voters\n\nThere was a complaint Tuesday morning of a man yelling at Scottsdale voters.\n\nJohn Ainlay, a prescient committee member for Legislative District 23, said a man in a Trump mask yelled at voters as they went to cast their ballots around 9 a.m. at Florence Ely Nelson Desert Park in north Scottsdale.\n\nThe man allegedly yelled things like \"baby killers\" and \"stop stealing my taxes.\" Ainlay said a woman from the Arizona Republican Party threatened to call the police on the man if he continued. He quieted down but remained at the voting site, Ainlay said.\n\nNonpartisan volunteers at the site said they were not able to remove him because he was outside the allowed 75 foot boundary, but they expressed concern over his presence and attempts to intimidate voters.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy\n\n10:30 a.m.: Smooth voting in Tucson, Cordes Lakes\n\nEstevan Puentes, a 39-year-old south Tucson resident, came out to vote with his family Tuesday morning.\n\nHis mother only speaks and reads in Spanish. That can be a problem when polling sites do not have any Spanish speakers or ballots that she can understand, Puentes said.\n\nHe brought his son and nephew who are first-time voters, as well as his sister to make sure his family’s votes were counted this election. They were able to get in and out quickly as there was no sizable line at the polling place.\n\nIn Cordes Lakes, a turn off Interstate 17 on the drive to northern Arizona, voters weren't blocked by long lines either.\n\nThe Cordes Lakes Community Center had a short line, people were mostly masked and many donned pro-Trump paraphernalia. A steady flow of cars ambled in and out of the gravel parking lot. Tranquil and quiet under expansive clouded skies, it was hard to believe people were there to cast their votes in the explosive 2020 presidential election.\n\nAround 9:45 a.m., it began to rain, but people still stood dutifully outside.\n\nRandy Rogers and Angie McFadin emerged from their white truck. Issues about the border and health care brought both to the polls near their home.\n\n“I don’t like our two candidates, I’ll say that. I’m not a fan of either one of them,” Rogers said, walking toward the line stretching from the doorway of the one-story community center. “I was a Trump supporter last time because I liked what he had to say, and I’m definitely not a Democrat. Republicans want to take everything and Democrats want to give everything away.”\n\nUnlike 2016, he said he isn’t voting for Trump in this election. For the first time in his life, he’s casting his vote for the third-party candidate on the ballot, Jo Jorgensen.\n\nThe change was largely due to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger said. The infection had swept through his sister-in-law’s entire family.\n\n“For me, I can’t vote for these two guys with a clear conscience,” he aid.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Emily Wilder\n\n10:15 a.m.: Rain in Gilbert, lines in Scottsdale\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had to close its doors and people made a dash for the dry interiors of their cars as rain came down in Gilbert.\n\nRecent ASU graduate Cameryn Baum stood outside of the Higley Road polling station with her cello this morning. She hoped to inspire more people to head inside and vote.\n\nBaum said she is participating in the nationwide Play for the Vote campaign, which is organizing musical performances throughout the country during Election Day to provide a positive incentive for people to head to the polls.\n\nIn Old Town Scottsdale, lines were long.\n\nEarlier in the morning, more than 100 people waited in line to vote outside Mini Social, a multi-use events venue in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nThe line of voters curved and winded around the store fronts of Fifth Avenue. Some people walking up to vote expressed sighs of frustration.\n\nScottsdale City Council candidate Betty Janik was making her way steadily through the line at 8 a.m., talking to voters about issues and answering their remaining questions about the candidates.\n\nBy 9 a.m. a volunteer had come outside to tell voters that there were several polling locations within four to six miles of Mini Social that had no wait times.\n\nMinutes later, there were roughly 80 people in line with a wait time of 20 minutes.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Lorraine Longhi\n\n9:45 a.m.: 'Hope that people are going to come together'\n\nVoters were largely optimistic at the Southern Plaza voting center in south Phoenix.\n\nMany emphasized the importance of the vote particularly in this tense and chaotic year, especially as Arizona stands on the precipice of historic change.\n\n“If anything if Arizona stays Trump but then turns blue it’s going to be an interesting time in the country,” said voter Sentari Minor as he left the polling center.\n\nThe atmosphere was friendly as political opponents and compatriots appealed to voters outside the center. Mia Hill, another voter at the center, said that despite tension leading in to the election that the outcome must be a call to unity.\n\n\"It was important to me that I bought and contribute to a positive future,\" Hill said. \"The fear of negative things happening, I think that’s all it is, is fear. I have hope that people are going to come together more than everything.\"\n\nJesus Olvera has children in school in south Phoenix. For him, the school board race was most important for his children’s future — but all the votes he cast were laying a foundation for them, he said.\n\nHe and other voters agreed the climate is ripe for change.\n\n\"I think there’s going to be a big change. I don’t know if it’s going to bring the results but it’s going to be a good time for us,\" Olvera said.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n9:30 a.m.: Rep. Debbie Lesko alleges 'bias' at polling location\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko tweeted on Tuesday morning that a county poll worker in Sun City moved polling lines without measuring them and told Lesko she had to leave.\n\nLesko tweeted that she was at Radiant Church Sun City, near 107th Avenue and Boswell Bouelvard, when this happened.\n\n\"This is what's typical of some people that are biased,\" Lesko said in the video. \"And it's wrong.\"\n\nMegan Gilbertson, a spokesperson for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said workers at the site mistakenly thought it was a non-electioneering site. In Arizona, people aren't allowed to campaign or solicit votes within 75 feet of the polling place.\n\nThe location used to be one, but this year is not, Gilbertson said. The department addressed the mistake with the workers and Lesko, she said.\n\n— Joshua Bowling\n\n9:15 a.m.: First-time voters in the Ak-Chin Indian Community\n\nAk-Chin Indian Community had a quiet morning as people prepared for the day.\n\nBut at the tribe's community service center, slow but steady numbers of vehicles pull in as tribal members and community residents of the tribe exercise their right to vote.\n\nSamantha Alejandro is married to an Ak-Chin tribal member. The mother of three arrived early to cast her vote. She said she is concerned with how fast the racial climate has changed. The first-time voter said she voted for Biden and Harris.\n\n\"I'm for peace,\" she said. \"And we need to take steps to get there.\"\n\nAnother first-time voter had a different take.\n\n\"The way the president has handled the pandemic has been a disaster,\" said Jose Batopis III, 28.\n\nBatopis, who's enrolled in the Yavapai-Apache Nation and also has Yaqui and Tohono O'odham heritage, lives in Ak-Chin and has lost an uncle, great-uncle and his grandfather to the coronavirus. He, too, voted for the Biden-Harris ticket. \"They will take the country in a better direction,\" Batopis said.\n\nFormer tribal chairman and Elder Terry Enos has heard many candidate's promises for Indian Country.\n\n\"The president said he do a lot of things and did a 180 instead,\" Enos said. \"Trump just doesn't get it.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Enos said that Biden walks softly but carries a big stick. He's not sure what will happen after the long count but still will urge his kids to come cast their vote.\n\nVolunteers for Native Vote, a nationwide initiative that supports voting and deals with voting issues, were on hand for any problems. Anna Marie Smith and Annalise Parady came armed with brochures, information on the Native Vote Hotline for any problems and lots of water and snacks for the day.\n\n— Debra Utacia Krol\n\n9 a.m.: Mayoral races in Phoenix, Scottsdale and Gilbert\n\nPhoenix's three-way race between incumbent Kate Gallego, Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay is a primary election, meaning a candidate must get more than 50% of the vote to win outright on Tuesday. Otherwise, the race goes to a runoff between the top two vote-getters in March.\n\nBoth Scottsdale and Gilbert follow the more traditional election cycle in which the primary was held in August. Tuesday's runoff mayoral races feature Lisa Borowsky and David Ortega in Scottsdale and Matt Nielsen and Brigette Peterson in Gilbert.\n\nBoth Phoenix and Scottsdale have council races on the ballot, too.\n\nThe Scottsdale runoff features six candidates for three seats.\n\nThe Phoenix primary has contested races in the four council districts on the ballot. The most crowded race is in District 7, where five candidates vie to replace term-limited Michael Nowakowski representing parts of south, west and downtown Phoenix.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Lines dwindle in Gilbert, West Valley\n\nAs lines at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert shortened after a busy morning, voters were able to get in and out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Higley Road.\n\nVeronica Parrillo, a first time nonpartisan volunteer, sat outside the polling place all morning to answer general questions that voters may have.\n\nShe said that the line had been moving pretty steadily.\n\n\"The longest I saw the line get was just over 20 minutes,\" Parillo said, adding that she expects more of a rush around lunchtime and later in the evening.\n\nIn Sun City West, lines had been virtually nonexistent since just after 6 a.m. Voters came by steadily but didn't have to wait in line.\n\nCarolyn Gelazela volunteered to watch the polling location at the R.H. Johnson Recreation Center. Before she left her home Tuesday morning, her daughter reminded her to take her vitamins and told her not to be afraid of COVID-19.\n\nThe recreation center requires voters inside to wear a face covering. Most voters who came by Tuesday morning wore a face mask or other covering.\n\n\"I'm not a big believer in this whole pandemic thing. People are dying, but people die,\" Gelazela said, adding that she hopes for Republican victories as election results come in.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Adrienne Dunn\n\n8 a.m.: McSally-Kelly Senate race captures eyes of the nation\n\nThe winner of the Arizona race to fill the seat initially won by the late Sen. John McCain could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., and Mark Kelly, the Democratic challenger, fought hard in a high-profile, high-dollar race.\n\nMcSally, a former Air Force combat pilot, crisscrossed the state by plane on Sunday and Monday to visit 11 cities from Yuma to Kingman.\n\nRecent polling suggests Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut, continues to lead in the race in the final days.\n\nThe winner likely will be on the ballot again in 2022; that's when McCain's term expires.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n7:30 a.m.: Some voters see lines\n\nEric Kurland, a Democrat running for Arizona House of Representatives in Legislative District 23, visited the Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley in Scottsdale on Tuesday morning.\n\nKurland, a teacher, was clad in a T-shirt for his campaign and a face mask with symbols of education: sharpened pencils and bright red apples.\n\n“I am just stunned by the amount of people that showed up this early for a vote that mostly everybody has already cast,” he said.\n\nIn Gilbert, Nicole Moon has been waiting in line to vote since 6:15 a.m. Tuesday. Moon, who works in communications, was still standing in line at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert shortly after 7 a.m.\n\nShe said she's concerned about unrest across the United States, no matter what the election results are.\n\n\"I think there's going to be a big political mess and probably some legal challenges,\" Moon said.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy, Kelly Donohue\n\n7 a.m.: Arizona is a battleground state this year. Here's why\n\nArizona is a magnet for transplants from across the country and has a large, Democratic-leaning Hispanic population that voted in more sizable numbers in 2018.\n\nAlong with a large independent electorate that swung mostly to Democrats two years ago, these factors helped push the state — once the base of GOP presidential nominees Barry Goldwater and John McCain — to battleground status.\n\nGrowing signs indicate these demographic trends could make it harder for President Donald Trump to hold on to a state he carried by 3.5% points in 2016. Recent polls show Biden in the lead.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n6:30 a.m.: Voters waited for polling places to open\n\nA steady stream of voters lined up early at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert.\n\nDozens were already waiting outside before the polling place opened at 6 a.m. The line grew and stretched into the parking lot within 30 minutes .\n\nVoters were mostly masked and socially distanced as they waited to go inside and cast their votes.\n\nAcross the Valley in Sun City West, a short but steady stream of voters made their way into the active adult community's R.H. Johnson Recreation Center.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Adrienne Dunn\n\n6 a.m.: Arizona polls open for historic 2020 election\n\nPolling places are in new locations this election, and Maricopa County voters can cast a ballot at any polling place, now called vote centers, rather than at an assigned polling place. COVID-19 precautions are in place. Masks are available to voters who did not bring them.\n\nVote centers, ballot drop boxes and drive-thru drop boxes will be open from 6 a.m. until polls close at 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nLocations for drop boxes and vote centers can be found at locations.maricopa.vote or by calling 602-506-1511.\n\nFor voters who:\n\nGot a ballot in the mail but didn't send it back yet: Drop it off at any drop box or vote center.\n\nGot a ballot in the mail but misplaced it: Get a new one at any vote center.\n\nWant to vote in person: Go to any vote center. See here for what you should bring.\n\nOverall, voting has gone smoothly since the county began opening vote centers and mailing out ballots on Oct. 7. By about noon Monday, the county had processed ballots for about 64.4% of the county's registered voters. That's about 1.68 million ballots out of 2.61 million registered voters.\n\nBy Sunday, early voting in the county had already surpassed total voting in 2016.\n\n— Jen Fifield", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/real-estate/2022/05/04/affordable-housing-lee-collier-county-apartments-rent-workforce-solutions-southwest-florida/6941965001/", "title": "Affordable housing shortage has long been a problem in Southwest ...", "text": "It's one thing to talk about how expensive housing is, but where's the action?\n\nAs history shows, developers aren't likely to construct affordable housing out of the goodness of their hearts.

Each is anywhere from $10 to $55 depending on size and style, according to the Squishable website.\n\nThe Christiana Mall store is one of 33 Squishable-branded stores listed on the website.

The mall still awaits. While much shopping nationwide has moved online, the malls are booming in duty-free Delaware. And Christiana Mall, Delaware's flagship shopping center, is the tax-free shop to rule them all – filled with shoppers from Maryland to Philly.\n\nEach year, the mall renews. Notable openings last year included jewelry and accessories store Kendra Scott, Swiss watch company Tag Heuer, jeweler Radcliffe (with a wee Rolex annex), activewear titan Lululemon, and plush toy spot Squishable.\n\nLast year:New stores, restaurants coming to the Christiana Mall for the 2023 holiday shopping season\n\nThis year boasted even more big names. Some are big legacy brands like Abercombie & Fitch and Carhartt. Some new clothing stores have never been seen before in Delaware, whether Japanese T-shirt titan Uniqlo, trendy clothing brand Dry Goods, or New York menswear bellwether Portabella.\n\nStill more, like Victoria's Secret and American Eagle, remodeled at Christiana this summer to meet the needs of a new retail world. Here are the new stores at Christiana Mall, as the mercury drops and shopping season heats up.\n\nFor more updates, you can join our Facebook group What's Going There in Delaware and subscribe to our free What's Going There in Delaware newsletter.\n\nChristiana resiliency:5 reasons why the Christiana Mall is bucking doomsday predictions for retail\n\nOpened August 16.\n\nBee & Co., a store themed for bees, is all about home goods, honey and wellness. This means bee-themed candles, bee-themed pillows (\"Keep Calm and Buzz\"), bee books, beeswax candles, habanero-infused honeys, and a host of wellness products derived from honey and pollen.\n\n\"Nobody works harder than the bee,\" says the store website. \"Bee & Co. has taken inspiration from these mighty little creatures and curated a well-rounded collection of products that promote natural and wholesome well-being.\"\n\nBuilding a better bee hive:Can this Delaware-invented beehive help save bee colonies from dying?\n\nOpened August 30, 2024.\n\nJapanese casualwear company Uniqlo is devoted to the simplest of the simple things: plain T-shirts, basic pants, classic clothes that don't go quickly in or out of style.\n\nThe Christiana location, in the former Pottery Barn, will be Delaware's introduction to the clothing brand that has come to dominate the retail landscape of modern Japan: Uniqlo controls more than 5% of the entire Japanese clothing market, according to company materials.\n\nTheir American takeover has been slow, since their entree into the U.S. market in 2005. But the company is now expanding rapidly, with 200 locations of the back-to-basics retailer projected by 2027. The Christiana location is a mid-sized entry, with more than 10,000 square feet of sales floor.\n\nOpened September 13.\n\nSouth-Carolina-founded Splash looks like a candy store, but it isn't. It is instead a \"natural\" branded beauty store devoted to a wild rainbow of soaps, lotions and shower gels.\n\nBy rainbow, we really mean it: \"Whipped soaps\" look like jarred scrunchies made of liquid neon, and come in flavors from mango to coconut to just plain \"sexy.\" Watermelon \"sugar soap\" is colored both bright green and bright red, and also comes in a jar.\n\nLavender-scented shower gels are wildly purple, while watermelon is brightly pink. Bath bombs look like 1980s pop art. Body butter seems to have as many flavors as a Baskin-Robbins, while a candle might look and smell like a cereal-topped ice cream sundae.\n\nOpened October 1.\n\nDry Goods is both one of the country's fastest growing new clothing stores. And though its name might still be unfamiliar in these parts, it and lays some deep historical claims. Though Dry Goods' first store opened in 2010 in Illinois, the chain's branding materials claim roots in legacy department store Von Maur's original 1872 \"dry goods\" store in Iowa.\n\nEach store is likewise branded to be \"vintage.\" But the brand will nonetheless be quite new to most in these parts – a contemporary young women's store selling dresses, shoes, accessories and gifts.\n\nThe Christiana Mall location will be the first in Delaware. The Cherry Hill Mall location, scheduled this year, also will be the first in New Jersey. By the end of 2024, Dry Goods expects to boast 84 locations in 24 states.\n\nOpened October 17.\n\nQuietly, Carhartt opened its only Delaware store on October 17.\n\nThe workwear company is a bit of a unicorn in the United States – a privately held clothing company owned since 1882 by the same family, who still bears the surname of Carhartt. Founded in Michigan, the famously rugged brand has become nearly a lifestyle in parts of the American West – not to mention a hardy staple of hip hop, punk and skateboard culture since the 1990s.Though sold at housewares stores and at farm stores like Tractor Supply, Carharrt does have about 50 or so of its own company stores. Now, one of them's in Delaware.\n\nOpened October.\n\nLegacy collegiate lifestyle brand Abercrombie & Fitch is on the upswing again these days — boasting double-digit sales growth and leaving far behind the days when it ranked as the nation's most hated brand, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\n\nAbercrombie closed at Christiana Mall in 2022, alongside tween brand Abercrombie Kids, but they didn't actually leave. Instead, Abercrombie converted those stores into two of its high-performing subsidiary brands: the laid-back, California-themed clothing store Hollister, as well as the Gilly Hicks underwear and activewear brand.\n\nIn the meantime, Christiana leasing manager Bill King said that Abercrombie had been on the hunt for a new space to launch an updated Abercrombie store. When home furnishing store Williams Sonoma decided to leave Christiana, Abercrombie & Fitch jumped right back in.\n\nYou can't keep a good ampersand down.\n\nOpened November 1.\n\nPortabella is a meanswear brand not just well known but ubiquitious in New York City, with 40 locations around the city. Lately, it's been expanding a bit farther out of the New York orbit.\n\nThe brand specializes in slim, flashy, dressy men's garb. This might mean yellow or baby-blue tuxes and suits in addition to classic three-piece silhouettes from designer Mehment Emin Teke; button-down shirts from subdued to striking; chinos in plaid patterns; jeans in less customary colors like burgundy' and sweaters with svelte silhouettes. They also sell a variety of shoes, from Faranzi or Stacy Adams slip-ons to a whole lot of Florsheim.\n\nNot open yet! Opening winter 2024/2025.\n\nThe one opening we cannot announce yet is the Christiana P.F. Chang's.\n\nAwaited for nearly two years, the eternally pending Christiana location of the Chinese-American chain is, well, still pending. The last word from P.F.Chang's management is that it will open sometime in winter, which may mean 2025.\n\nNonetheless, it's been visibly under construction at the former Panera location since at least this summer.

Johnson never likes it when the high school basketball season ends.\n\nThe Stephen Decatur boys basketball coach is always looking for an excuse to get on the court and teach the game he’s loved all his life.\n\nTraditionally, once the conference’s senior all-star game ends, the high school season is officially in the books. If Johnson gets his way, however, basketball on the Shore will live on for one more game.\n\nAfter years of envisioning and brainstorming ideas, Johnson is hoping to bring a Maryland vs. Delaware all-star match to the region, featuring 24 of the best senior athletes from the Bayside and Henlopen conferences.\n\nWith 12 on each side, the “Maryland vs. Delaware Senior All-Star Game” would give athletes one last opportunity to take the court on the high school level. Since players rarely get to take on the other state’s squads in the regular season, Johnson said the contest would allow them to finally discover who has the best conference in the region.\n\n“I just think it’s time,” Johnson said. “We want to enhance not only the conference but the area in basketball. It gives our seniors another chance to play in front of college coaches, it will be a really competitive game, and it’s just time for change.”\n\nMORE HOOPS:Decatur's Kevon Voyles requests release from UMES basketball\n\nMORE DECATUR:Athlete goes from troubled past to bright future\n\nJohnson hopes to introduce the game as early as next season, featuring both boys and girls teams, while having the states alternate hosting responsibilities.\n\nThe Decatur coach said venues like the University of Maryland Eastern Shore or Delaware State could be potential hot spots.\n\nBut before any coach books the facility, a meeting must first take place to discuss specifics, including a budget, date and time, potential sponsors and entertainment.\n\n“It’s just someone taking the initiative to put it together,” Johnson said. “It’s been mentioned before, but no one has moved forward, and I’m willing to move forward with it. It would be good for the area in regards to basketball.”\n\nOne of the coaches who said he’s willing to help in any way is longtime Wi-Hi coach Butch Waller.\n\nThe 52-year head coach was the architect of another event that pins Maryland and Delaware basketball teams against one another.\n\nThe Governor’s Challenge basketball tournament is an annual event that has grown to be the largest holiday competition in the country. Before it brought in several other states, the tournament was primarily a battle to see which state had the best high school hoops teams.\n\nAlthough the all-star game would be a smaller scale, Waller said the talent and potential to succeed is there — someone just has to make the first move.\n\n“On paper, it looks like a great idea — it just comes down to logistics,” Waller said. “The athletes are allowed two all-star games, so if we can have another one, I think the kids would love it, and it’d be good exposure for them. It comes down to getting the pieces together.”\n\nBut creating a second all-star game may be easier said than done when looking at all the areas coaches would have to address.\n\nThe biggest topic would be a date and time. The Henlopen and Bayside conferences have different playoff schedules, with Delaware’s season normally running longer.\n\nMORE SPORTS: Pitcher who nearly died now gives athletes the future he never had\n\nWith spring sports right around the corner, coaches would have to ensure the game wouldn’t interfere with other contests to which their athletes have already committed.\n\nAnother factor is insurance. For the first time, the Bayside Conference Coaches Association had to take out insurance for the all-star game in March, as well as the practice that took place the day before. With safety being the primary concern for the MPSSAA and DIAA, it’s hard to imagine an additional contest without a call to the insurance company.\n\nBut the biggest issue may be how to divide the funds that are raised during the contest.\n\nConferences would not be allowed to simply divide the money equally, which is why Cape Henlopen head coach Stephen Re thinks it's vital to bring in a third-party organization to help find solutions for the multiple issues.\n\n“It can be hard getting on the same page,” Re said. “You almost need someone else, a third party, to come in and take a hold of it, kind of like the Delaware all-state selections. We’re not as involved with it, and we need another group or person to monitor it all.”\n\nBut Johnson believes those obstacles can be overcome, and a dual-state all-star game can finally come to fruition.\n\n“It’s all about the kids, and it’s a great event, so I think we can get this done,” Johnson said. “We’ll look into everything and make sure we get it right.”\n\nJohnson said another holdup in the past has been getting Delaware coaches to jump on board.\n\nWith 13 teams making up the Henlopen Conference, Johnson said Delaware, much like Maryland, needs a coach to step up to make the game happen.\n\nIn the past, Johnson and Re have discussed the idea of a conference all-star game, but until every coach sits down and discusses the specifics, the idea will never see the light of day.\n\n“One guy can’t do it alone,” Re said. “You really need a collective, collaborative group to make it happen. We have to get all the coaches involved. It’s got some funky parts to it, but hopefully we can figure those things out.”\n\nWhether it’s next season or a few years down the line, Johnson is adamant about bringing another all-star game to the Shore.\n\nAs a “basketball junkie,” the Decatur coach sees what kind of impact that kind of contest could have on an athlete and fans.\n\nThough there’s already a Governor’s Challenge, Johnson didn’t rule out the idea of inviting politicians, such as local senators, and calling the game the “Senator’s Cup.”\n\n“Each year, that senator could put something in their office,” Johnson said. “I know (Maryland Sen.

With less than eight months remaining between now and the start of the next season, Johnson said it’s time to start moving.\n\n“We need a change,” Johnson said. “You always hear the chatter, ‘Who has the best conference?’ It gives the kids another chance to go out and be the best they can be, and that's the biggest thing.”\n\nMORE SPORTS:Parkside baseball back on top despite major losses in offseason\n\nMORE SPORTS:JMB kicker Stephen Oscar commits to Division I Towson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/06/03/delaware-state-hires-sanfords-waterman-basketball-coach/7530498002/", "title": "DSU hires Delaware high school coaching mainstay as mens ...", "text": "Delaware State University is hiring one of the area’s most successful coaches to lead its struggling men’s basketball program.\n\nHe just has never coached a college basketball game before.\n\nBut Stan Waterman will rely on his energy, people skills and considerable basketball knowledge to clear that hurdle.\n\nHe’ll certainly face greater challenges while taking over a program that hasn’t finished above .500 since 2011-12 and was barred from its 2021 conference tournament due to previous academic woes.\n\nThe Sanford School coach’s hiring will be officially announced Friday, DSU spokesman Steve Newton told Delawareonline/The News Journal.\n\n“For every high school coach, I imagine the dream is to someday become a Division I head coach,” Waterman said Thursday afternoon, “and I’ve had a few opportunities in the past to at least join somebody else’s staff as an assistant.\n\nWARRIORS WIN AGAIN: Defense key in Sanford state title\n\n“When this opportunity became available and to be able to do that in my own state, in my own backyard and not uproot my family certainly made it interesting. And I have to say with the wonderful work that [president] Tony Allen is doing down at Delaware State University – everything is on the rise – it seems like a great, great time to become a part of that institution and that family.\"\n\nWaterman, 55, is a former Howard High and University of Delaware point guard. He became Sanford coach in 1991-1992 after one year each as an assistant at Wilmington University and at Sanford.\n\nIn 30 seasons, he guided the Warriors to 571 wins, 10 state championship games and eight titles, including the last two in 2019 and 2021. His 2020 team reached the state semifinals before the COVID-19 pandemic’s arrival shut down the tournament.\n\nThere were more than 90 applicants for the job.\n\nWhen Waterman earned the Tubby Raymond Award as 2016 state Coach of the Year from the Delaware Sportswriters & Broadcasters Association, former Sanford point guard Kenny Mitchell sang his praises.\n\n\"Stan is somebody that you want to run through a wall for,\" said Mitchell, who led NCAA Division I in assists at Dartmouth, \"but he's also someone who cares deeply about you as a person.\"\n\nWaterman replaces Eric Skeeters, who was dismissed in April after three seasons during which the Hornets went 16-64 overall and 8-35 in the MEAC. They had just one victory over a Division I foe while going 3-16 in 2020-21. Skeeters had been an assistant at several programs before getting the DSU job.\n\nSeveral Delaware State players, including second-team All-MEAC guard Myles Carter and third-team All-MEAC guard Pinky Wiley, then entered the transfer portal. Wiley is headed to Hampton.\n\nDelaware State will also announce the hiring of Towson assistant E.C. Hill as women’s basketball coach. She’ll replace Dave Caputo, also let go in April after three seasons. The DSU women have had 13 straight losing seasons, including 3-12 in 2020-21.\n\nIn announcing the coaching changes in April, Allen had told DSU it was time to “chart a new, bolder path\" for the school’s athletic future centered on academics, culture, community and \"an unquenchable HBCU spirit.\"\n\n“Today, I firmly believe that in coaches Hill and Waterman, we have found the individuals of quality who will lead their programs to a winning tradition,” Allen wrote in an email to Delawareonline/The News Journal Thursday, “and, more importantly, continue to mold the young women and men who play for them into the leaders that our global community needs.’’\n\nWaterman faces a from-the-ground-up rebuilding job.\n\n“It’s June and that’s the busy time in college basketball in recruiting,” Waterman said. “I’ve got to put together a staff and make an assessment of the roster that we have and try to figure out what direction we go.\n\nUNFAIR TO COMPARE: HBCU schools such as DSU regularly get APR penalties\n\n“But the biggest challenge is to make sure that I try to create and establish a culture. I think that’s critical. When I say that I’m talking about winning the right way and I mean winning in the classroom and winning in the community as well as on the court.”\n\nThere is not a rich history of men’s basketball at Delaware State.\n\nThe Hornets have not finished .500 or better in men’s basketball since going 18-18 in 2014-15, when they lost in the MEAC title game and played in the College Basketball Invitational.\n\nThe Hornets made their only NCAA Tournament in 2005 under coach Greg Jackson after winning MEAC regular-season and tournament titles while finishing 19-14.\n\nThey won the next two MEAC titles as well but lost in the conference tournament and settled for National Invitation Tournament berths, winning a first-round game in 2006 while going 21-14 and ending up 21-13 the following year.\n\nDelaware State has had just two winning seasons since.\n\nPLAYER OF THE YEAR: Sanford's Njoku gets top honor\n\nThe school hired a high school coach before to lead its men’s basketball program and it didn’t go well.\n\nIn 1983, Joe Dean Davison was hired after going 224-40 in 10 years at Dunbar in Washington, D.C. He was fired after two seasons at DelState, largely due to problems off the court.\n\nEven though Waterman is making a significant move up to the college level, he’ll use what he did at Sanford, the private school in Hockessin with high academic standards, as somewhat of a model.\n\nNumerous Sanford players went on to play and excel at the collegiate level, with recent graduate Nnanna Njoku now bound for Villanova and Jyare Davis recently landing at Delaware. Waterman has also been a coach on United States youth national teams.\n\n“I think the idea and the premise and the philosophies are the same,” said Waterman, who is dean of students and assistant athletic director at Sanford.\n\n“Establishing a work ethic, a positive attitude, having success, competing in the classroom as well as on the court, being involved in the community. Those are the things that I hope to establish in the minds of the people in the program.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But he kept the faith in himself and his ability.\n\nNow, in his first season as a University of Delaware player after transferring, defending teams practically don’t have a prayer when Davis gets the basketball.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Sanford School graduate from Newark continued his stellar play Monday night at the Carpenter Center, contributing 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting and a game-high 14 rebounds to the Blue Hens’ 81-60 win over James Madison.\n\nBOX SCORE: Delaware 81, JMU 60\n\nA career-high 30 points from Jameer Nelson Jr. led the Blue Hens. But even Nelson marveled at Davis, who earned his third straight Colonial Athletic Association Rookie of the Week honor earlier Monday.\n\n“He might be Rookie of the Week for the rest of the season,” Nelson said, “but I feel like, you get a little recognition it’s like ‘Oh, I can do this all the time.’ . . . There’s no ceiling for him now.’’\n\nFive of Davis’s seven baskets Monday were dunks, much to the delight of the 1,298 in attendance and his teammates.\n\n“Man, look out,” Nelson said of Davis’ willingness, confidence and ferocity while going to the basket.\n\nCAA STANDINGS: Blue Hens try to stay in hunt for top spot\n\nDavis had been a regular contributor off the bench for the Blue Hens, scoring 11 points in a Dec. 5 win over UMBC before missing two games with an injury and two more with a non-COVID illness in December.\n\nBut he has been a force since stepping in for first-team All-CAA post Dylan Painter, who suffered an ankle injury at Towson Jan. 27 and has played only 10 minutes in Saturday’s loss to Hofstra since.\n\nDavis has shot 68 percent (34-for-50) and averaged 15.2 points in the last five games.\n\nDelaware improved to 17-9 overall and 8-5 in the CAA Monday in its last league contest against James Madison (14-11, 5-9), set for a summer move to the Sun Belt Conference driven by a desire to play Bowl Subdivision football.\n\n“Dylan got hurt and it’s just next man up and I’m just happy I can help my team win,” Davis said.\n\nSUPER FOR REEDER: Sallies grad, Ex-Hen part of winning Rams\n\nWhen Davis decided to transfer last year, Delaware, which had recruited him in high school and was close to home, was a comfortable option.\n\nBut Davis didn’t feel wounded by his Providence experience. He arrived at Delaware still confident in his abilities.\n\n“Throughout that whole process,” he said, “everybody was just telling me God has a plan for everybody. And that’s something I just lived by and something I made sure to take on during tough times.\n\n“I never really lost confidence in myself,” he added. “I definitely put the work in by spending time in the gym. A lot of those shots and a lot of the things I do out there in games and stuff are things I’ve done hundreds of times, every morning, every night.”\n\nRARE REUNION: Ex-Hens Pegues, Brey square off as coaches\n\nEven if players transfer from a Big East program such as Providence to mid-major Delaware, it’s still a high level of college basketball, Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby pointed out. There are plenty of challenges and adjustments, and they can take time.\n\nNow Davis is seeing the positive results of his diligence and a mindful approach,\n\n“He is a student of the game,” Ingelsby said. “He’s a hard worker. He’s got great instincts and just being back in the gym with a coaching staff that really has believed in him and given him confidence . . . It wasn’t always smooth sailing. There were some hard days. There were some tough days.\n\n“But he loves to compete and I think he’s very comfortable with who he is as a basketball player now and how he can make an impact for us.”\n\nHOT HAND: Hens can’t cool Hofstra shooters in loss\n\nDavis initially was straying more toward the perimeter than Delaware wanted. Ingelsby and his staff felt Davis could be most effective in the post, which has proven to be quite perceptive.\n\n“Make your mark around the basket,” Ingelsby said of the staff's message to Davis. “That’s where you have an advantage at this level. And I think he’s just comfortable with who he is. He had some success and all of a sudden you see the impact he can make. He’s scary talented with what he can do with his size and physicality.”\n\nAs an example, Ingelsby mentioned Davis rebounding his own miss in traffic late in the first half Monday and slam-dunking the putback.\n\n“When I first got here I settled for a lot jump shots,” Davis said, before coaches \"talked to me about making sure I go strong to the basket and just see if I can get the easy one. I’ve been doing that the last couple games.”\n\nThe results have often been prolific.\n\n“He’s a focal point of our offense now,” Ingelsby said. “ . . . He’s having fun playing basketball and that’s really I think what we’ve been able to pull out of him. Just get back to having fun.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

All have been All-CAA picks, including Painter making the first team last year.\n\n\"You don't want to end your college basketball career on a 15-game season where you lose in the first round of the CAA Tournament,\" Painter said, \"so having the opportunity to come back has been a blessing.\"\n\nBACK TO THE FUTURE: Two basketball recruits commit to Hens\n\nIn addition to returning regulars such as Ebby Asamoah, Andrew Carr, Aleks Novakovich and Gianmarco Arletti, Delaware added a pair of impact transfers.

But their new leader sees this as the perfect place to end a four-year coaching hiatus.\n\n“I’ve been looking to get back into coaching, and I thought this would be a great opportunity,” DiNardo said. “Padua has always been a top-notch program. I just think it could use a little help right now, getting back at the top.”\n\nDiNardo has a track record of success, racking up a 169-63 record at Sanford, Ursuline and Archmere. She believes more winning is on the horizon at Padua, which earned DIAA titles in 1980, ’81 and ’99 and was a consistent contender for many years.\n\n“We want to make it fun for them. Winning is a lot of fun,” DiNardo said. “… There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be good in basketball. Academically, it’s a top-notch program. Everybody is looking to go there. So I don’t think it will be a problem of people wanting to come.”\n\nRELATED: Celebrate young athletes at the Delawareonline Sports Awards\n\nDiNardo played at Delaware Tech and Wilmington College, then assisted the Wildcats for two years before taking over as head coach for five seasons.\n\nShe then moved into high school coaching, guiding Sanford to an 84-30 record and four Independent Conference titles from 2000-04.\n\nThen she moved on to Ursuline, going 46-6 and winning two DIAA state titles in two seasons (2005-06). Her daughter, Deana DiAmico, was an All-State point guard. And having the greatest player in Delaware girls basketball history — current WNBA star Elena Delle Donne — on the roster didn’t hurt, either.\n\n“[Delle Donne] actually was my daughter’s best friend,” DiNardo said. “She was probably at my house just as much as she was at her own. It was great. She played hard and we had some great times.\n\n“But I can tell you that there’s nothing like winning two state championships with your daughter at point guard. It can’t get any better than that. Those two years, they were fun.”\n\nThen she moved to Archmere to coach another daughter, Jenna DiNardo. The Auks went 39-27 from 2006-09, winning two Diamond State Conference championships.\n\nHer next step was back to college, taking over a losing program at Harcum Community College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She guided an immediate turnaround, as the Bears went 97-23 from 2009-13, won three NJCAA Region 19 titles and reached the quarterfinals of the NJCAA Division II National Tournament in 2011.\n\nDiNardo left Harcum to attend to some family health issues, but never lost her love for coaching.\n\n“I’ve been missing it every year,” she said. “Every time October and November roll around, there’s something missing in my life.”\n\nDiNardo’s husband, Bill, is the longtime football coach at Salesianum. DiAmico will join her as an assistant coach, making her return even more rewarding.\n\n“When she played for me, she was my coach on the floor,” Sheila DiNardo said. “She definitely knows the game. … She challenges me, makes me think out of the box.”\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

Hartley (15-3), Columbus Academy (16-3) and Northside Christian (14-5) lead divisions II, III and IV, respectively.\n\nThis is the first season seeds were determined statewide by a ratings percentage index adopted by the Ohio High School Athletic Association rather than coaches’ votes.\n\nThe Central District still employs an open draw in which coaches place their teams on the bracket.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the draws:\n\n1. Central District’s ‘bottom’ Division I bracket is loaded\n\nIt’s the lowest on the page of the four Division I district brackets, but it might ultimately produce the most drama.\n\nOnly one of third-seeded New Albany (16-4), No. 4 Newark (17-3) and No. 6 Westerville North (16-4) – if any – will emerge as a district champion from the late game March 9 at Ohio Dominican.\n\nNew Albany, which under first-year coach Tim Casey already has won the OCC-Ohio, jumped on defending district champion Newark after passing the first time its name was called. The teams could meet in a semifinal March 6.\n\nCasey has utilized the pass many times over the years, usually with success considering he has won more than 500 games.\n\nThe bracket also includes last year’s state runner-up and 2022 state champion, No. 15 Pickerington Central (12-7), which could see North in a semifinal. Central handed Orange its loss, beating the Pioneers 59-56 on Feb. 3.\n\n2. Bottom bracket winner probably faces No. 1 Olentangy Orange at regional\n\nThe champion of the bottom district bracket earns a showdown with the winner of Orange's bracket in the first of two regional semifinals March 13 at Ohio Dominican.\n\nOrange could face No. 9 South in a district semifinal and No. 8 Reynoldsburg in a final.\n\nFifth-seeded Hilliard Bradley (14-5) is the best seed in its bracket, which also includes No. 7 Licking Heights (16-3), No. 13 Westerville Central (12-7), No. 14 Pickerington North (12-7) and No. 17 Olentangy Liberty (12-8).\n\nThat district champion lines up for a potential regional semifinal against No. 2 Delaware Hayes (19-1), which is the only single-digit seed in its bracket.\n\n3. Hartley doesn’t have easy road in Division II\n\nIf the top seeds hold serve in Division II, the No. 1 Hawks will face tough challenges as they battle for a district championship.\n\nHartley could see No. 8 Granville (12-8) in a semifinal March 6 and No. 2 River Valley (15-5) in a final March 9 at Central Crossing. River Valley opted to take a spot in Hartley's bracket that also includes a first-round bye.\n\nIn the other portion of the bracket, defending regional champion Ready (13-6) is seeded third and could see No. 6 Jonathan Alder (12-7) in a semifinal. No. 4 Bloom-Carroll (13-7) and No. 5 Watterson (11-8) could meet in the other semifinal.\n\n4. Columbus Academy locks up top seed in Division III\n\nThe Vikings are a No. 1 seed for the first time in the 11-season tenure of coach Jeff Warstler. They last won a district title in 2008, as a No. 3 seed, and earned No. 2 seeds in 2013 and 2017.\n\nAcademy could face No. 9 Grove City Christian (15-4) in a semifinal March 4. No. 4 Northridge (14-5) or No. 5 Worthington Christian (15-4) could be the matchup in a final March 7 at Ohio Dominican.\n\nThe Vikings (8-2) are second in the Central Buckeye League behind Worthington Christian (9-1) with two games to play, including a matchup between the teams in their league finale Friday at Academy. The Vikings won the first meeting 52-44 on Jan. 16.\n\nThe other bracket includes No. 2 North Union (16-3), No. 3 Harvest Prep (16-4), No. 6 Fairbanks (18-4), No. 7 Heath (14-5), No. 8 Fredericktown (13-5) and No. 10 Cardington (14-6).\n\nHarvest Prep has won back-to-back district titles and five in the past six seasons. The Warriors might be peaking at the perfect time, as they have won nine consecutive games.\n\n5. Northside Christian again tops Division IV\n\nEven with a different look from a season ago, the Lions are the No. 1 seed in Division IV for a second year in a row.\n\nLast year’s leader, now-junior forward Landon Vanderwarker, now plays at Delaware. He paced the Lions to the regional final at Ohio University, the path this year’s team would take.\n\nThird-seeded Galion Northmor (13-5) and No. 4 Patriot Prep (12-7) are possible district final opponents.\n\nSecond-seeded Shekinah Christian (17-3) headlines the bracket that will feed into the Kettering Fairmont regional. No. 5 Tree of Life (11-8) and sixth-seeded Fisher Catholic (9-9) are in line for a district semifinal meeting, with the winner possibly seeing Shekinah.\n\nOnly the top five teams in the 19-team bracket have winning records. Ninth-seeded Morral Ridgedale is 9-9.\n\nsports@dispatch.com\n\n@DispatchPreps", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/11"}]}

He said members could use bathrooms in their private offices, which can be a 10-minute walk from the House floor where voting and debate take place, or unisex bathrooms in the Capitol.\n\nMcBride said she would comply with Johnson’s order but called it a distraction from more substantive issues. “I’m not here to fight about bathrooms.

And the ones in power protect each other to keep it quiet. Just ask the House Ethics Committee. Or the President-elect of the United States.”\n\nTransgender rights have become a political rallying cry for right-wing politicians in the U.S. Lawmakers in 37 states introduced at least 142 bills to restrict gender-affirming healthcare for transgender and gender-expansive people in 2023, Reuters reported, nearly three times as many as the previous year.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Rachel Barber, Sudiksha Kochi, and Savannah Kuchar; USA TODAY Network's Xerxes Wilson and Reuters contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/11/20/rep-sarah-mcbride-delaware-congresswoman-transgender-politician-nancy-mace-marjorie-taylor-greene/76448219007/", "title": "Sarah McBride faces new tests in US House – months before ...", "text": "(This story was updated after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Wednesday afternoon announced a policy banning transgender people from using restrooms in parts of the Capitol that correspond with their gender. Rep.-Elect McBride also issued a new statement to follow.)\n\nRep.-Elect Sarah McBride just wants to get to work.\n\nThis month proved a historic election as the Delaware native was the first openly transgender politician voters sent to the halls of U.S. Congress. It also marked her first time stepping into public office at the national level. And within days, it was obvious that job would mean joining the ranks of a House of Representatives in a Republican majority.\n\nCome January, the 34-year-old will be sworn into office under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, alongside two red chambers. The state senator will be far from Delaware's Democratic supermajority, giving way to a divided House and more polarized national politics.\n\nNew tests are already clear.\n\nMcBride ran understanding these realities, but anti-trans pushback has been swift. Transgender issues have been used as a political flashpoint throughout the presidential election, and now House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced a policy banning transgender people from using restrooms in parts of the Capitol that correspond with their gender.\n\n“All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings – such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms – are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,” he said in a statement Wednesday. “It is important to note that each Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol.”\n\nMcBride put a response that afternoon simply: \"I’m not here to fight about bathrooms.\"\n\n\"I'm here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families,\" she continued Nov. 20. \"Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.\"\n\nRegardless, a soon-to-be colleague had already stirred bathroom contention earlier in the week.\n\nU.S. Rep. Nancy Mace presented a resolution seeking to ban transgender women from using female restrooms inside the Capitol. The South Carolina Republican suggests barring members and employees alike from “using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex,\" as previously reported. GOP members must put together a routine rules package to govern the House, expected to be voted on in January.\n\nAnother fellow colleague was an unsurprising supporter. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Mace’s legislation “doesn’t go far enough,\" in a video posted to social media, and the Republican suggested she’d consider a physical altercation if McBride used women’s restrooms.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson didn't bring down the temperature. Come Tuesday, the Republican from Louisiana had issued a statement to a gaggle of press, saying \"a man is a man, and a woman is a woman\" but that \"we treat everyone with dignity.\" He did not elaborate until Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAs this trend continues, months before McBride is supposed to be sworn in, she called it all a distraction.\n\n\"This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,\" she wrote in a statement. \"We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"\n\nShe has said it before.\n\nDeeper read:Delaware woman makes history for trans representation. And that’s part of the story\n\nFamiliar issues, higher temperature\n\nMcBride has been no stranger to hate.\n\nDuring the campaign that just got her to the House, swells of support were also joined by dead-naming yard signs and occasional hecklers. Her family was worried about her running at all, while she debated stepping away from work she loved as a state senator.\n\nWhen it comes to governance, McBride has described a productive relationship with her counterparts in the Delaware legislature.\n\n“I've teamed up with Republicans in Dover,” she told Delaware Online/The News Journal post-primary. “Not just moderate Republicans, but deeply conservative Republicans – deeply conservative Republicans who don't believe in the validity of LGBTQ identities, who don't vote for LGBTQ rights bills – but whom I've worked with to expand access to oral health care in rural communities, to pass paid leave, to craft compromises on gun safety measures.\"\n\nLong before she became a senator, McBride volunteered with Equality Delaware after coming out publicly at American University. As Delaware's first bills for both marriage equality and gender nondiscrimination moved through the legislature in 2013, McBride helped lobby across the aisle. She testified in heated public hearings on her own experience, as did her family. Familiar bathroom narratives were common then, too, as she described in her memoir.\n\nBoth laws passed in the same year.\n\nMcBride continued that focus within the Center for American Progress. Later, she worked as the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group.\n\nMcBride is familiar with disagreement, discrimination and even already rising safety considerations for Capitol Hill. The temperature will be far higher than that of the First State, but the Democrat has remained confident she'll work across a widening divide — with those open to it.\n\n“Look, there are Republicans who won't work with any Democrat,” she explained back in October. “Those are the same Republicans in Congress that might not work with me for an extra, added reason.”\n\nIt doesn’t impact her priorities.\n\nAfter her decisive win on Nov. 5, McBride said her victory sends a policy message from Delawareans, echoing her goals in Congress: boosting accessibility to housing and health care, protecting reproductive freedom and guaranteeing paid leave.\n\nAnother autopsy:Is Delaware becoming a purple state?

Others noted good being done by county police and paramedics.\n\n\"The programs provided by New Castle County are literally keeping the children in my community alive on a daily basis,\" said Daniel Elkins. \"Nobody ever lost votes for saying no to a tax increase, but sometimes we have to do the hard thing.\"\n\nLikewise, officials from labor unions representing public safety and public works employees warned the council against cutting their workforce.\n\nIn budget presentations throughout the county in recent weeks, Meyer has presented residents with what some have described as \"doomsday\" scenarios of cuts to county services if the increase wasn't approved.\n\nAmong those cuts are ending proactive policing, closing two major parks like Glasgow or Rockwood, no longer cutting the grass at 207 neighborhood parks and closing a major library like the new, $30 million Route 9 library or the Brandywine Library.\n\nCouncil members characterized that talk as \"scare tactics.\" They attacked Meyer's credibility when a last-minute proposal was floated while members voiced their uneasiness with a 15 percent increase.\n\nKilpatrick interrupted debate on the 15 percent increase saying an amendment to raise taxes 12.5 percent had made its way down from the eighth-floor executive office during the meeting.\n\nThe move didn't garner one vote and infuriated some members.\n\nCouncilman Bill Bell said the move was \"too little, too late\" after months of debate and requests for compromise.\n\n\"This isn't 'The Price is Right,'\" Bell said. \"This is serious business.\"\n\nMeyer said Kilpatrick communicated via text message that she was amenable to such an increase, buffered by other revenue from fees paid on real estate transactions.\n\n\"By the time the ordinance was written and got to the floor, I guess Ms. Kilpatrick changed her mind,\" Meyer said after the meeting.\n\nShe did not vote on the amendment.\n\nWith multiple council members' votes still undecided on the 15 percent increase, the amendment might have been the death knell for Meyer's initial proposal.\n\nThe additional revenue to supplement the 12.5 percent increase wasn't discussed on the council floor. This led some to question if Meyer really needs a 15 percent increase to make the numbers work.\n\nCouncilman Jea Street called the move \"the epitome of an insult to the (legislative) branch.\"\n\nThe amendment also made county labor representatives unhappy after being warned that drastic cuts would be required in lieu of the full, 15 percent increase.\n\nCouncilman George Smiley said he was ready to vote in favor of the 15 percent increase, but changed his mind seeing the amendment.\n\n\"This doesn't deserve one vote because of the way it was handled,\" Smiley said.\n\nMeyer denied having a communication problem with council. He said such criticism over the amendment was down to a \"misunderstanding with how it was presented.\"\n\n\"That's all I can say,\" he added.\n\nWith less angst, council raised fees that pay for sewer infrastructure and operation on Tuesday.\n\nCounty officials have said the average customer currently pays $263 annually for the service and will see that go up about $36. The proposal will bring an additional $6.9 million for the county's sewer fund.\n\nThe sewer hike and failed property tax increase and come as the state's General Assembly is considering giving the county permission to raise taxes on hotels, cap who is eligible for first-time home-buyer tax exemptions and give local government more money to pay for paramedic service.\n\nWith those proposals pending, the council and Meyer's administration must now come up with new revenue ideas or make millions-worth of cuts to county services to balance the budget for the beginning of the coming fiscal year on July 1.\n\nCounty Council has scheduled a special meeting for Tuesday to discuss the budget impasse.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

King St.\n\nThe company bought the six-story, 86,000-square-foot structure behind the DoubleTree Hotel last year for a reported $1.85 million.\n\nThe past seven months have been spent rehabbing the three floors and moving Alpha Technologies’ equipment and staff from its former home in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe renovated facility now includes a training center where employees can improve their skills in programming and software development.\n\n“We just finished yesterday,” Virk said “Today is a day off and then tomorrow we start getting to work.”\n\nTech company SevOne hit by spear phishing data breach\n\nFounded in 1997, Alpha Technologies provides IT support, software development and data center management services to investment banks – including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit Suisse – along with retailers and companies in the insurance, pharmaceutical and telecommunications industries.\n\nThose are the same types of services many U.S. corporations have moved overseas in recent decades in a quest for cheaper labor and looser regulations.\n\nSome estimates claim more than 2.8 million U.S. jobs will be outsourced, or offshored, this year alone. The trend has decimated the U.S. manufacturing sector, while computer programmers and engineers are now the top jobs at risk to be outsourced.\n\n“These companies are taking food off their own table and shipping it offshore,” said Virk, an Indian immigrant who obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1997.\n\n“This country has given me everything and I want to give back by keeping jobs here,” he said. “To do that, we’re going against offshoring by offering a rival on-shoring solution.”\n\nWhile the company also operates centers in India, Singapore, the Czech Republic and Poland, Virk said those sites cater to companies in their own countries and do not seek out U.S. business.\n\nVirk also confirmed about a third of Alpha Technologies’ current U.S. workforce hold an H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign talent to work here temporarily.\n\n“We don’t bring workers from overseas,” he said. “They are people who were already here as students and graduated before we hired them.”\n\nDelaware TechHire becomes model for nation\n\nAlpha Technologies currently employees about 400 workers worldwide, including 30 based at the new Wilmington headquarters.\n\nThat local workforce is expected to grow to more than 240 by 2019 as Virk adds more domestic clients.\n\nFor instance, Alpha Technologies is currently finalizing a deal with one of the nation’s largest mortgage companies that will result in nearly a dozen new hires, he said.\n\nIn a series of marketing videos unveiled during Thursday's grand opening, Alpha Technologies argues that sending jobs “half a planet and 12 time zones away” is not as cost-effective as it might appear.\n\nTravel costs, difficulties with cross-border data security and even simple language barriers will convince more corporations to bring outsourced jobs back to the U.S. in the next five years, Virk said.\n\nA recent survey by Boston Consulting Group found that’s also the case for many manufacturers, with 17 percent now “actively reshoring” their operations back to the U.S., up from 13 percent in 2013.\n\n“This is a big deal,” said U.S. Rep. John Carney, a Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nIn Congress, “we argue until the cows come home about offshoring … but we don’t come with many practical ideas about how to bring jobs back to the United States,” he said. “This is the best way you could give back by creating jobs and bringing them back from overseas.”\n\nBringing Alpha Technologies to Wilmington was not without some costs, however.\n\nThe company initially planned to move its headquarters to Raritan, New Jersey, but that deal fell apart amid a dispute over the construction of residential property on the proposed site.\n\nAlpha Technologies ultimately chose Wilmington after being offered $1.2 million in state Strategic Fund grants, along with city tax breaks valued at roughly $400,000.\n\n“You have a partner for life,” Mayor Dennis Williams told Virk at Thursday’s grand opening event. “My office is right across the street and I’m open … You can come right in my office and I’ll make you coffee.”\n\nGov. Jack Markell noted the event was attended by federal, state, county and city elected officials, along with top business leaders. That, he said, is an indication of the rare pro-business environment that helps attract companies like Alpha Technologies to Delaware.\n\n“It’s a really competitive world,” he said. “Your customers have choices and you have choices. Our job is to make sure the choice is made to be here in Delaware.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/11/07/nh-lgbtq-leaders-dark-times-trump/76088615007/", "title": "NH LGBTQ+ leaders see 'dark times' with Trump presidency", "text": "Alice Wade, a 2024 college graduate who won Tuesday in her first run for the New Hampshire House of Representatives, struck a somber rather than celebratory tone Wednesday. She was asked to reflect on the future of transgender rights in the Granite State.\n\n“It is a very dark time for trans people and queer people in general,” Wade said.\n\nWade, a transgender woman and Dover Democrat, is concerned about Republican President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign relentlessly targeted transgender people in TV advertisements, as well Republican Gov.-elect Kelly Ayotte, who endorsed Trump.\n\nWade, an aerospace engineer, is also concerned about Republican leadership in the State House and U.S. Senate, which flipped red.\n\nIn 2018, Gov. Chris Sununu, who did not seek re-election, signed into law a bill banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity. But in July 2024, he signed into law a bill preventing any physician from performing “genital gender reassignment surgery” on minors and signed another banning transgender girls in grades 5 to 12 from playing on girls’ sports teams. Enforcement of the latter law was subsequently blocked by a federal court in September.\n\nThe passage of recent laws sparked Wade, a 2024 University of New Hampshire mechanical engineering graduate, to begin advocacy work and ultimately to run for the state House of Representatives. Her fight to protect other transgender people in New Hampshire has only just begun, albeit in the minority party of the House chamber.\n\nTransgender leaders and advocates in New Hampshire are encouraging transgender youth, adults and supporters across the state to continue fighting for their rights, despite gender-affirming care becoming a focal point of presidential political campaign commercials in recent months.\n\nTrump targets transgender athletes, mocks pronouns\n\nOne Trump commercial played frequently on TV in recent weeks attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2019 support for gender-affirming care for people in jail, and criticized transgender athletes playing girls sports.\n\n“Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” the Trump-approved ad states.\n\nWade expects the next state legislative session to feature bills attacking access to gender-affirming care and a possible return of a bathroom bill. In July, Sununu vetoed a bill that would have outlined such restrictions against transgender people in New Hampshire.\n\nBathroom laws have been enacted in Florida and Texas, requiring people to use the bathroom that aligns with their sex assigned at birth. These are two states where Wade could consider working in the future because they are home to aerospace companies.\n\n“If I wanted to start a new job, I would have to work around those restrictions because I can’t move to a state where I’m going to go to jail just for using the restroom,” Wade said. “That’s just not feasible. There’s this constant 'otherization' that the Republicans have been doing for many years at this point, particularly with immigrants, but more recently they’ve seen transgender people as a political weapon they can use.”\n\nFor her safety, Alice Wade’s fiance offered to move to Massachusetts or another state after legislative restrictions targeting transgender people were signed into law in New Hampshire. Wade turned down that offer.\n\n“I refused because I don’t want to escape when I know there are so many families in New Hampshire that can’t just pick up their lives and move,” Wade said. “We can’t give up and go away and let other people suffer because of these terrible bills.”\n\nAyotte campaign responds to concerns\n\nWade said she expects Ayotte to sign any bill with restrictions against transgender people that comes to her desk. John Corbett, a spokesperson for the governor-elect’s campaign, responded to the claim on Wednesday.\n\n“Kelly is going to be a governor for all of New Hampshire and will always work across the aisle to protect the rights of all Granite Staters,” Corbett said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNew Hampshire House's first trans woman legislator speaks out\n\nWade’s election on Tuesday came as Sarah McBride, a state senator in Delaware, became the first transgender person elected to U.S. Congress. It also comes as state Rep. Gerri Cannon, a Somersworth Democrat and one of the first two openly transgender women to serve in the New Hampshire House, is set to retire from state government.\n\nCannon, 71, was an adolescent when she began feeling different from her male peers. She was taunted and teased at school, and it wasn’t until the “advent of the Internet” in the 1990s when Cannon was able to find stories of people who experienced exactly what she’d been feeling for decades.\n\nSince 2006, Cannon has been living fully as a transgender woman. She changed her birth certificate roughly eight years ago to reflect her gender identity, in case she was traveling through a state with laws restricting transgender people.\n\nCannon has a message for the state’s transgender community: “Don’t panic. There is another day. We did make some big strides over the last couple of years.\n\n“The big thing for the transgender community is they’re not alone,” she added. “They’ve got a lot of people here who will stand up and fight. It’s not over.”\n\nStill, she feels worried for the future of the state’s transgender community amid recent proposals from legislators and ongoing efforts to bar transgender girls from playing on school sports teams.\n\n“This makes the trans population feel threatened especially because of the 2025 efforts underway. I’m feeling more and more like a second-class citizen. Am I American and am I free? It doesn’t feel like it. It feels like a separate class and that hurts,” Cannon said.\n\nTargeting LGBTQ+ rights called part of political 'playbook'\n\nEmmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller in Concord and Dover, ran and lost election for the state Executive Council this year.\n\nHis businesses have been safe havens for LGBTQ+ people over the years. Teatotaller has been targeted by neo-Nazi group protests and has been on the receiving end of hateful rhetoric.\n\nIn a second Trump presidency, Soldati believes the rights of all LGBTQ+ people are threatened. In New Hampshire, he said the “playbook” used by some Republican candidates for the state legislature who won Tuesday focused on “demonizing and threatening people of the LGBTQ community.”\n\n“We need to stay strong and vigilant to make sure that we aren’t creating an environment that feels even more hostile in a state that touts civil liberties as its core mantra,” he said Wednesday.\n\nPrevious story:Why are there so many bills about gender identity in New Hampshire?\n\nSoldati, a Somersworth resident, encouraged Granite Staters not to succumb to “outside pressure and prejudice” when it comes to LGBTQ rights and to focus on issues that can be controlled locally to create change.\n\nTransgender New Hampshire residents and other LGBTQ people do not deserve the “harm and demonization” that they’ve been subjected to in bills and from lawmakers, Soldati added.\n\n“Too many politicians have allowed for this issue to gain currency because if you can’t run on your economic platform or your health-care platform or other social platform, you move to fear,” he said.\n\nThe Rev. Heidi Carrington Heath, executive director of Seacoast Outright in Portsmouth, which serves LGBTQ+ youth, offered a message of hope.\n\n\"This is a very hard moment for the LGBTQ+ community in New Hampshire, and beyond,” she said in a prepared statement, reacting to Trump's election. “Acutely so for our youth. If you are an LGBTQ+ youth in New Hampshire, we want you to know that you matter, and are deeply loved. There are so many people who love you, and are ready to stand with you. We will keep working for a Granite State where you are not only safe, but celebrated for all of who you are.\"\n\nTrevor Project data on LGBTQ+ youth mental health in America\n\nThe Trevor Project, a nonprofit focusing on LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention efforts, released its 2024 report in May.\n\nThe survey polled over 18,000 American LGBTQ+ people 13 to 24 years old.\n\nRoughly 39% seriously attempted suicide in the year prior, 46% of whom are transgender and nonbinary young people, according to the findings.\n\n“Among transgender and nonbinary young people, 13% reported being on gender-affirming hormones, and 2% reported taking puberty blockers,” the 2024 report reads. “Sixty-one percent who were on gender-affirming hormones were somewhat or very concerned about losing access to this care.”\n\nA total of 90% of respondents reported their well-being had been negatively impacted due to recent politics, while 45% of transgender or nonbinary young people were found to have considered moving to a new state because of LGBTQ+-related laws where they reside.\n\nRates of attempted suicide among young LGBTQ+ Indigenous or people of color in America were higher than white respondents, the report states.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Sarah McBride's name.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/03/24/sodel-concepts-plans-brewpub-ocean-view-2022/6982995002/", "title": "SoDel Concepts plans a brewpub in Ocean View in 2022", "text": "A Sussex County-based restaurant group that runs a brewpub in Rehoboth Beach is planning another one in Ocean View in spring 2022.\n\nSoDel Concepts said its new brewpub will be called Ocean View Brewing Co.\n\nOcean View Brewing Co. will be built at Route 26 and Woodland Avenue in Ocean View.\n\nThe 5,000-square-foot, 200-seat restaurant is being designed by Fisher Architecture based in Salisbury, Maryland.

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON -- The number of people on food stamps in Delaware has dropped slightly over the last few years, but there are still people so hungry that they start eating out of their donation bag even before leaving a food pantry in Wilmington.\n\n“Even with produce, they’ll sit down and start eating,” said Joseph Hickey, director of St. Patrick’s Center on the east side of the city.\n\nPeople living in that kind of poverty are often overlooked, but they are living in Delaware and the deep poverty that has gripped them is spreading, Hickey said.\n\nThe percentage of people living below the federal poverty line across the state is 12.5 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau – that figure has crept up from 11.7 percent in 2013. Over that same time period, the number of people collecting SNAP benefits, or food stamps, in Delaware has fallen from just over 152,000 in 2013 to about 150,500 this year, according to numbers from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services.\n\nThe adversity isn’t spread evenly across Delaware; there are pockets of deep want around the state. Nearly a quarter of Wilmington residents live below the poverty line.\n\nHunger in Central Jersey's backyard\n\nThose who come to St. Patrick’s, in an old brick schoolhouse on a quiet corner, sign a form declaring that their annual income is below the federal poverty line before they can take home food.\n\n“It’s a mere formality,” Hickey said, because they all live below the threshold.\n\n“We’re talking about extreme poverty here,” he said, throwing his reading glasses down on a particle board desk with a ragged strip of its veneer missing on one corner.\n\nMany of the people who come to the center have zero income, he said – they’re homeless. Others live on incomes scraped together from benefits or low-paying jobs.\n\nFor Delores Butcher, 54, who takes care of five grandchildren, the pantry at St. Patrick’s is the difference between having a house and being homeless.\n\n“This place saved my life,” she said, sitting at one of the long, wooden tables in the center’s main room. The bookshelves standing against the wall and the nubby brown pile of the carpet make it feel like an elementary school classroom.\n\nSt. Patrick’s has been around since 1971, starting out as a senior center and evolving to serve the needs of the neighborhood.\n\nButcher first heard about it in 2000, she said, “but I didn’t come till seven years later.”\n\nIn 2007, Butcher found herself homeless for a short time, after having worked in clerical jobs since she left the Marine Corps in 1982.\n\n“It’s been rough. And I mean rough,” she said, silver hearts dangling from her ears emphasizing the nod of her head.\n\nShe was born and raised in Middletown and many of her 13 brothers and sisters are still in the area, so she bounced around between them for a while until she could get back into a home of her own again. “I just kept going 'round and 'round,” she said.\n\nNow she has housing through Section 8. She unplugs her microwave and TV when she’s not using them to save on electricity. Food is expensive, she said. Without the pantry at St. Patrick’s and the Sunday Breakfast Mission, which serves meals every night, she wouldn’t be able to afford everything.\n\n“The rough part is Christmas time,” Butcher said. Last year, St. Patrick’s filled every single wish on her grandchildren’s lists. She had to take two trips to get all the gifts home. “I could barely see,” she said, because her eyes were filled with tears.\n\nDonia Gonzales-Copeland, 67, helps run the food pantry at the Mount Salem UAME Church in Delaware City. She has always noticed the effect the holidays have on charity.\n\n“It’s real funny, my mother pointed this out to me – people open up their wallets on Christmas and Thanksgiving,” she said. “Two times out of the year, people get food, the rest of the time it’s a crap shoot.”\n\nNovember and December are big months for donations, Hickey said, and they fund much of their budget for the year then. The corporate and foundation grants they get have gone up since they’ve gotten more aggressive in pursuing them, he said, and the charitable donations from individuals have also gone up recently in response to the center’s growing need.\n\nSalvation Army seeks better way to track poverty\n\nPatricia Beebe, president of the Food Bank of Delaware, said her statewide organization has seen an increase in need, too. It’s been focusing on children – more than half of its programs are now geared toward young people – and every year, the demand for those programs grows, she said.\n\nOne in five children in Delaware lives in poverty, Beebe said.\n\nThe Food Bank started putting food closets in schools across the state about three years ago, she said. About 35 schools now have a place where children and parents can go to get food when they need it.\n\nA year before that, the Food Bank started its backpack program, which sends enough food home with needy kids to get through the weekend. That program gets bigger every year, she said – it finished out the last year averaging about 5,400 backpacks a week.\n\nThere are a lot of people who don’t qualify for government assistance, but who are still very poor, Beebe said. So, as more people learn about the Food Bank’s programs, the bigger they get.\n\nSometimes, the demand for a program is much higher than an organization realizes, which is what Hickey found about six months ago when workers at St. Patrick’s started hearing that some senior citizens weren’t coming to the daily lunch because they didn’t have the $2 for the suggested donation. St. Patrick’s made the meal free and attendance tripled.\n\n“People couldn’t afford two bucks,” he said.\n\n“People here deal in pennies,” Hickey said, explaining the realization he came to after solving a minor mystery. Most people won’t even bend over to pick up a penny on the street, but at the end of the week when he’d go through petty cash gathered from the center’s sale of 35-cent coffee and 25-cent crackers, there were tons of pennies. He couldn’t figure out where all the pennies were coming from.\n\n“Then it dawned on me – poor people use pennies,” he said. Twenty pennies and a nickel is a quarter for crackers.\n\n“People don’t realize there’s another world out there and it’s a world of extreme poverty,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ud/2023/02/01/delaware-football-blue-hens-announce-new-recruits-on-signing-day/69841094007/", "title": "Delaware football Blue Hens announce new recruits on Signing Day", "text": "Some apparent holes in the University of Delaware's football roster have received a February fill-up.\n\nThe second National Letter of Intent Signing Day brought potentially important and immediate additions throughout the defense plus at wide receiver and in the kicking game for the Blue Hens on Wednesday.\n\nThe dozen additions includes 10 transfers, including two highly regarded wide receivers expected to boost coach Ryan Carty's spread offense.

All of the candidates rightly support the reduction of unjustly harsh mandatory minimum sentences, overhauling our unfair cash bail system, and reducing sky-high incarceration and recidivism rates.\n\nThe question in this election is, who is best positioned to make these reforms a reality? We think the answer is clear: Kathy Jennings.\n\nJennings has a formidable resume, having served as state prosecutor and chief deputy attorney general. She has a sterling reputation among state lawmakers, given her many years as a top official in the Department of Justice.\n\nFor example, she played a key role in eliminating the \"three strikes\" laws that imposed gratuitously tough sentences for minor crimes. This legislative experience is important, because many necessary reforms will require action in Dover.\n\nWhile reform should be at the top of the next attorney general's agenda, there other important issues to tackle — and Jennings has the credentials for all of them.\n\nShe grappled directly with the opioid crisis as New Castle County's chief administrative officer.

And she has personally prosecuted some of Delaware's highest-profile cases, so we can be confident in her ability to bring justice to those who truly deserve it.\n\nVoters Guide:Learn more about the upcoming elections\n\nWe wrestled with this endorsement after interviewing Jennings' Republican opponent, Bernard Pepukayi. As someone who grew up in the Garfield Park area and faced drug charges as a teen, he compellingly argues that his life experience makes him uniquely suited to fight for a more just criminal justice system.\n\nBut we think Jennings' clout and reputation in Legislative Hall and decades of experience give her the best odds of actually getting reform across the goal line.\n\nJennings' opponents have questioned the depth of her commitment to criminal justice reform, insinuating that she is only taking these positions out of political expediency. Make no mistake, we give this endorsement with the expectation that Jennings will get results, and we will be keenly watching to make sure that her campaign promises are not empty.\n\nBut we're confident that Jennings' commitment to a better, fairer criminal justice system is real. And she's the best prepared to turn that commitment into reality.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/30/400-retiree-bonus-added-lawmakers-spending-plan/657311002/", "title": "$400 retiree bonus added to lawmakers' spending plan", "text": "Retired state employees could see a $400 bonus in their pension checks later this year.\n\nThe Joint Finance Committee on Wednesday voted to include the one-time expense — valued at nearly $11 million — in the final budget proposal it will recommend to the General Assembly next month.\n\nThe bonuses are part of $73 million in new spending the panel has proposed beyond what Gov. John Carney had recommended in January. That amounts to roughly two-thirds of the $180 million in additional revenue added to the state's bottom line since the start of the year.\n\n\"I think it's wonderful news,\" said Germaine Hurst, a retired Mount Pleasant High School nurse.\n\n\"For a lot of us former state workers, our pension is our main source of income but it never goes up like the cost of our medication, food and gasoline,\" she said. \"This isn't a long-term increase but I think it will help.\"\n\nThe bonuses would represent one of the first income increases approved for the 27,000 people who earn a state pension since 2015 when the General Assembly granted them a 1-percent, cost-of-living increase.\n\nYet officials with some state employee unions said they were hoping to see something more permanent.\n\n“While we are appreciative of the funding increase for our pensioners, we have concerns that the increase for those on fixed incomes will not continue beyond Fiscal Year 2019 without further action from the General Assembly,\" said Mike Matthews, president of the Delaware State Educators Association.\n\nState retirees have been \"left in the lurch\" for quite some time, said Mike Begatto, executive director of the Delaware chapter of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees.\n\n\"I think they were certainly seeking something longer term,\" he said. \"But hopefully these bonuses will help them pay some bills.\"\n\nThe retiree bonuses approved by the JFC this week are in addition to the $500 bonuses the panel approved last week for current state workers — at a cost of $23 million.\n\nBoth bonus packages also are in addition to the 2-percent raises for public school educators and $1,000 pay hikes for other state workers included in Carney's spending plan.\n\n\"In 2009 when we were in a recession, the first area we went for relief was a salary reduction for state employees and I don't think they ever recovered,\" said JFC member Rep.

It just increases the chances of something catastrophic happening.\"\n\nThe JFC proposed a slew of other funding proposals on Wednesday totaling $23.5 million, according to a tally kept by state officials. Most were relatively small compared to the panel's overall $4.32 billion spending plan — an increase of 5.2 percent over the current fiscal year.\n\nThe panel this week agreed to include $4.1 million for school bus contractors to provide raises for their drivers.\n\nIt also agreed to allocate $2 million from the Tobacco Settlement Fund to restore a prescription drug assistance program that was completely gutted last year and another $400,000 in restored funding for the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition's mammography van.\n\nThat spending comes after the JFC earmarked $92.5 million beyond the governor's recommended budget last week, including:\n\n$46 million that will be carried forward a year to help the state cover costs in fiscal year 2020\n\n$6.4 million for special education in grades K-3 and reading specialists in grades K-4\n\n$4.7 million to improve services for nearly 5,000 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nAnother $61 million in projected revenue remained unspent as of Wednesday.\n\nSome of that money will go to nonprofits as part of the annual grant-in-aid allocation, while the rest could be used cover one-time capital expenses or numerous other spending proposals now pending before the General Assembly – decisions that will be made in the waning days of the legislative session.\n\n\"We covered a lot of need,\" said JFC co-chair Sen.

The crew of the Espadon released two white marlin and put five gaffer dolphin in the cooler on a trolling trip to the Baltimore Canyon. The Baltimore also produced red hot mahi action for anglers aboard the Marlin, with 40 fish on ice at the end of the day. Fishermen aboard the My Cin connected with a cooler full of mahi while trolling a bit further south at the Poormans Canyon. The crew also released a nice white marlin on the trip. Deep water bottom bouncing outside the 50-fathom line provided plenty of action on a mix of blueline tilefish, golden tilefish and jumbo sea bass, with quality fishing reported from the area of the Baltimore Canyon south to the Norfolk. Boaters trolling and chunking at the Hotdog, Hambone, 19-Fathom Lump, Massey’s Canyon and the Teacup had reports of on and off action on bluefish, bonito, Spanish mackerel and schoolie mahi. The snags on the Del Jersey Land Reef and the deep-water wrecks outside the 20-fathom line are providing good fishing for a variety of popular species. Captain Cody Waddington of the Long Neck charter Another Bill returned from a recent wreck trip with a catch that included keeper sea bass, cod, ling and flounder. Wreck fishermen are reminded that the last day of the summer black sea bass season is Sept. 19. The fall season will open from Oct. 18 through Dec. 31, with a creel and size limit of 15 fish a day and a minimum keeper length of 15. Boaters targeting flounder are still reporting good fishing around the structure on Artificial Reef Sites Nine, 10 and 11, on the hard bottom at the Old Grounds and in the shipping channel around the DB and DA buoys. While a lot of the fish are measuring short of the 16-inch minimum, anglers who put in the time are generally rewarded with their share of keeper sized flatties. Captain Brent Weist of the Lewes charter Katydid has been on a roll when it comes to ocean flounder, with trip after trip producing good numbers of keeper-sized fish. Topping the weekly flounder reports from Captain Brent were a 6-pound citation for angler Ron Mistretta Jr. and one caught by Dave Walker that tipped the scale at 6 pounds 2 ounces. Most of the reports indicated short flounder to be a lot more common than keepers, but there also were a few real nice fluke caught by ocean fishermen. Anglers targeting flounder in the shipping lane and at Reef Sites 10 and 11 also are reporting good numbers of croaker, with some of the fish measuring more than 15 inches. Effective baits for the hardheads include bloodworms, strips of clean squid, bloodworm-flavored Fishbites and surf clams. Shore and boat fishermen also are catching a fair number of croaker in Indian River, Massey’s Ditch, Indian River Bay and Rehoboth Bay. There also have been reports of flounder being caught in Delaware’s back bays, but the number of keeper fish has been extremely low. Anglers checking in at Old Inlet Bait and Tackle are having some luck on legal rockfish along the inlet jetties at night, with sandfleas and live eel listed as the top producers. Surf casters are reporting increasing numbers of snapper bluefish along the Delaware beaches, according to the crew at Bill’s Sport Shop. Anglers stopping at the shop also reported croakers, kingfish, black drum and red drum in the local surf.\n\nDon’t let rain dampen your deer hunt\n\nDELAWARE BAY\n\nAnglers fishing from the Cape Henlopen Fishing Pier scored on a mix of flounder, hardheads, spot, snapper bluefish, skates and a few small weakfish during the past week, with most reports listing squid, bloodworms, FishBites and Gulp! as the most productive bait choices. Shore fishing reports from the lower bay also included a mix of small trout, puppy drum, croaker, flounder and spot at Broadkill Beach, Beach Plum Island, Roosevelt Inlet and Lewes Beach. Boaters returning from the lower bay’s Artificial Reef Sites reported keeper-sized fluke on flounder rigs baited with minnow/squid combo baits, Gulp! Swimming Mullets, fresh strip baits and silversides. The mid and lower bay reefs also are a good choice for bottom-fishing action on hardheads, kings, pufferfish, porgies, small trout and snapper bluefish. Wade Guinn was fishing lower bay structure aboard the Angler when he landed a 3.34-pound trigger fish. The catch was weighed and reported by Joe Morris at Lewes Harbour Marina. Catch-and-release shark fishing led reports from boaters checking in at Smith’s Bait in Leipsic during the past week, with most of the action provided by brown sharks. Locations providing some of the best shark action included Miah Maul, Cross Ledge, the 10 buoy and Cedar Bush Hole. Reports from the shop also indicated good reef fishing action on flounder, croaker and bluefish in the upper bay at Artificial Reef Sites One and Two. Shore fishing reports from anglers stopping at Captain Bones Bait and Tackle indicated continued action on a mix of white perch, croaker and catfish at the Woodland Beach fishing pier, with bloodworms, squid strips and bloodworm Fishbites at the top of the bait list.\n\nAaron Nola may not get shut down before end of season\n\nRIVERS\n\nCatch reports from the crew at Master Baiter’s Bait and Tackle listed catfish and croaker as the primary focus of anglers fishing the Delaware River shore at Augustine Beach. Most of the fish are reportedly being caught on bloodworms or chunks of bunker. Anglers targeting largemouth bass enjoyed quality fishing in the tidal waters of the Nanticoke River while working deeper structure with Senko plastics. The Nanticoke has also been a top choice for jumbo catfish, according to fishermen stopping at Taylored Tackle in Seaford, with both channel cats and blue cats being caught. The top producers of big catfish are night crawlers, cut bait and chicken livers. The Route Nine Bridges in southern New Castle County topped the river reports from anglers stopping at Captain Bones Bait and Tackle, with most of the action coming from white perch and channel catfish. Reports from the crew at the shop also indicated good catches of blue crabs at Silver Run, Appoquinimink Creek, Drawyers Creek and Blackbird Creek.\n\nPONDS\n\nLargemouth bass led most of the pond reports, with some improvement in daytime fishing action noted over the past week. Bass fishermen checking in at Captain Bones Bait and Tackle reported good early morning fishing at Noxontown Pond, Garrisons Lake and Dover’s Silver Lake on buzzbaits and surface poppers. They also reported good afternoon fishing in the pond’s deeper areas while fishing crankbaits and Sweet Beaver lures. Catch reports from the crew at the Williamsville Country Store also were focused on largemouth bass, with Millsboro Pond and Killens Pond earning high recommendations. Topping the lure list for the ponds were Scum Frogs, jigs and buzzbaits. Hearn’s Pond continued to provide some of the best bass fishing action in the Seaford area, according to reports passed along by Jerry Taylor at Taylored Tackle, with topwater lures including poppers, Jitterbugs, buzzbaits and plastic frogs listed as top producers.\n\nEagles' DeMarco Murray shrugs off Cowboys barbs", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/06/20/body-found-car-wal-mart-weeks/11053497/", "title": "Body found in car at Wal-Mart after 3 weeks", "text": "Terri Sanginiti\n\nThe News Journal\n\nAuthorities in Maryland are waiting for the state medical examiner to identity a woman found dead in a car at Wal-Mart in Elkton – three weeks after the vehicle was parked there.\n\nThe body was discovered about 3 p.m. Thursday by a groundskeeper at the store on U.S. 40 who noticed a foul odor and was searching for its origin, said Elkton police spokesman Lt.

Like many cultural touchstones, comedy viewership has begun to split along partisan lines.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nNow, a group of antiestablishment comedians has found a pot of gold serving a conservative audience. While these comics often say their jokes aren’t intended to be partisan, they largely cater to right-wing crowds looking for a reprieve from political correctness.\n\nAnd in the last few years, their viewership has skyrocketed.\n\nUkraine is running out of weapons:Is it also running low on the time-tested coping mechanism of humor?\n\nThe burgeoning group includes personalities like Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Gutfeld – who since 2021 has consistently ranked as the top-watched late-night comedian in America – beating out major network stars including Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon.\n\nTheir popularity suggests the rise of a new conservative culture movement – one that GOP politicians and commentators are paying attention to.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made waves in late August when he sat down for an episode of Von’s podcast, “This Past Week,” and his appearance on \"Gutfeld!\" in mid-September marked the ex-president’s first time on late-night television since 2016. Trump has also expressed a desire to appear on Rogan’s show, which ranks No. 1 on Spotify.\n\nAs Trump and the GOP attempt to grow their base, particularly among young men, these nontraditional, highly popular, comedic voices could provide the perfect avenue through which to reach them.\n\nThe void\n\nThe growth of conservative-leaning comedy over the last few years in many ways has mirrored the emergence of left-leaning satirists like Jon Stewart in the early 2000s.\n\nStewart, the host of Comedy Central’s \"The Daily Show\", gained popularity for mocking the idiosyncrasies of former President George W. Bush and his administration. While he took aim at both political parties, as well as the news media, Republicans were often the butt of his jokes.\n\nMuch of Stewart’s young audience at the time leaned liberal, and many thought of him as a news source. A 2004 Pew Research poll found that 21% of people ages 18 to 29 regularly got their election coverage from \"The Daily Show\" and other comedy programs like \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nLike the conservative comedians emerging today, however, Stewart didn’t view his show as expressly ideological. He acknowledged his own liberal biases but said in a 2005 interview with the Guardian that his foremost goal was to make people laugh.\n\nBy the time Stewart left his post as the full-time host of \"The Daily Show\" 10 years later, his influence was evident. Alumni of his show like Jon Oliver, Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee, dominated the late-night comedy world.\n\nThose, and many other late-night programs, had begun to lean into liberal points of view in their monologues. Few mainstream comedians were speaking to the perspectives of the millions of Republican viewers across the U.S.\n\nMore Democrats than Republicans watch late-night comedy, according to a YouGov poll published earlier this year. Half of Republicans said that these shows focus too much on politics and 57% said they're too liberal. Only 10% of Democrats saw the same political bias.\n\nNick Marx and Matt Sienkiewicz, authors of the book “That's Not Funny: How the Right Makes Comedy Work for Them,” argue that the void gave way to the rise of comedians like Gutfeld and Rogan.\n\n“Many of them correctly assessed that there was a market for right-leaning comedy,” Marx, a professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University, said. “Whether they believed it or not, they leaned into it hard, and they’ve become … quite profitable.”\n\nA political undercurrent\n\nThese comedians don’t think of themselves as overtly partisan.\n\nTom O'Connor, the executive producer of \"Gutfeld!,\" said that while the late-night show airs on Fox News, a network associated with conservative viewpoints, it isn’t explicitly designed to appeal to people of a particular party.\n\n“It’s just what’s funny to us,” said O'Connor. \"Whether someone else wants to say, ‘Oh, this is conservative comedy,’ we don’t necessarily think of it that way.”\n\n\"Gutfeld!\" has more Democratic viewers than some other late-night shows, including ones hosted by Fallon and Kimmel, according to Nielsen MRI Fusion data from July. But his audience overwhelmingly identifies as Republican. There were under 600,000 Democrats who watched his show in July, compared to 1.3 million Republicans.\n\nAnd just as Jon Stewart holds more liberal stances, Gutfeld has a conservative point of view. Those personal beliefs at times seep into the show. When Trump was a guest, for instance, Gutfeld repeatedly described him as both the 45th and 47th president, though Trump is currently in a tight race to win the title for a second time.\n\nThe same goes for Rogan who, throughout his decades-long career, has made jokes about and expressed support for politicians on both sides of the political aisle. He has attempted to walk a careful line by defining his humor as more politically incorrect than overtly partisan.\n\nBut since 2020, Rogan has showcased far more right-leaning politicians and commentators on his podcast than left-leaning ones. They’ve included politicians like Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have both endorsed Trump, and conservative commentators such as Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, and Matt Walsh.\n\nDuring an episode with Carlson, Rogan gave a rationale for why far-right radio show host Alex Jones spread conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Rogan described Jones as a “friend for more than 20 years.”\n\nHe said Jones' false claims about the shooting, which led Jones to pay a multimillion-dollar settlement to the families of the victims, stemmed from mental health issues – something he said some people receive “praise” for being honest about.\n\n“Alex has gone through some real issues. And one of the reasons he has gone through some issues is because that guy is uncovering real s---- that’s terrifying every f------ day,” Rogan said of the conspiracy theories Jones promotes. \"When you see so many lies, and so much propaganda and so many psyops that are being done on people, you start seeing them where they don’t exist. And that’s what he did.\"\n\nRogan also has often repeated pro-Trump talking points and false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris on his show. In an episode with conservative columnist Matt Walsh, he pushed the debunked conspiracy that Harris' pearl earrings during their recent presidential debate were secret Bluetooth earpieces. He later expressed doubt about the validity of Trump’s 34 felony convictions in his New York hush-money case.\n\n“It is true that he's a convicted felon now, but is it true that it makes any sense? No,” Rogan said.\n\nMarx and Sienkiewicz argue that, regardless of Rogan’s own political beliefs, the guests he has on, and the rhetoric he uses, are meant to embrace the more conservative-leaning viewers who watch his show. His personal political beliefs might be murky, but Sienkiewicz said “it’s very clear what his demographics are.”\n\nHis show, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” has been the most popular podcast in the U.S. for the past five years. He has more than 17 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nA majority of those listeners are young men, and nearly half identify as Republican, according to a 2022 study published by Morning Consult. Many of them hold similar beliefs to those that Rogan discusses in his show.\n\nOnly 12% of Rogan listeners surveyed in a 2022 YouGov Poll trusted newspapers to print the truth, compared to 27% of the general population.\n\nRogan is just the tip of the iceberg of conservative and libertarian-leaning comedy podcasts. His club in Austin, the Comedy Mothership, has cultivated a group of alternative comics who cater to a similar audience.\n\nVon, who has appeared at the club and on Rogan’s podcast multiple times, hosts the ninth most listened to podcast on Spotify. Similar to Rogan, he hosted an early 2000s reality show – \"Road Rules\" – and frequently toes the line between politically incorrect jokes and mildly political conversations on his podcast.\n\nOne of the Comedy Mothership’s biggest stars, Tony Hinchcliffe, now ranks at No. 7 on Spotify’s comedy podcast charts. During a special episode of his show, \"Kill Tony,\" in which Carlson and Rogan appeared, Hinchcliffe called the pair two of his “favorite humans on planet Earth.”\n\n“He's trying, with some amount of success, to build a, you know, an alternative right-wing comedy space at his mothership in Austin,” Marx said of Rogan.\n\nThe 2024 impact\n\nIn a tight presidential race – where tens of thousands of votes could decide the election – both major political parties are looking for ways to appeal to key voters. And these highly watched and listened to personalities could influence enough voters to make a crucial difference.\n\nWhile Harris and Democrats have leaned into memes to energize a younger voter base, Trump and Republicans have been trying to widen their base of support among men, particularly young men, who are target viewers for right-leaning comedy.\n\nRepublicans have long held leads among men in presidential elections, and this election is no different. A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll shows Trump leading Harris among men by 5 percentage points, 51% to 46%. In the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk poll, the breakdown of support of the 43% of respondents who said they’d vote for Trump shows that more than half (51%) are men, while 36% are women.\n\nTrump’s campaign has attempted to further cultivate support among male voters by appearing with masculine cultural figures. Earlier this summer, the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee showcased speakers like Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a longtime friend of Trump's, and Hulk Hogan, a controversial professional wrestler who helped bring the sport into the mainstream.\n\nVon, who interviewed Trump last month, and Rogan also both have ties to Ultimate Fighting Championship and White. The comedian Tyrus, who is a mainstay guest on \"Gutfeld!,\" also dabbled in the fighting world as a professional wrestler. He gifted Trump a custom wrestling belt when the ex-president appeared on the show earlier this month.\n\nMarx sees the convergence of comedy, the fighting world and politics as a potential boon for the Republican Party.\n\n“It's all a very intentional push to get young men to vote,” he said of Trump's appearances with the comedians and fighters. “There's a real, sort of robust and growing market for conservative entertainment content and ... comedy is a precursor.\"\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information, a title and the first name for Vice President Kamala Harris and to correct the misspellings of Tom O'Connor and Matt Sienkiewicz's names.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/09"}]}

Kirkwood Highway is a prime example. Driving along this four-to-six-lane roadway — or even trying to access it — can feel like a venture down a rabbit hole. For pedestrians and cyclists, attempting to traverse this busy thoroughfare often turns into a heart-pounding and potentially dangerous exercise.\n\nTo address challenges, transportation officials are developing plans to transform Kirkwood Highway from a high-speed corridor into a more community-friendly thoroughfare that better serves local residents and businesses. The project's latest developments were discussed at a public workshop Thursday, where officials presented draft recommendations for improving both transportation and land use along the highway.\n\nLed by the Wilmington Area Planning Council, or WILMAPCO, the Kirkwood Highway Corridor Land Use and Transportation Plan envisions a redesign of an 8.3-mile stretch of Kirkwood Highway, also known as Route 2, where it intersects with State Routes 72, 7, 41, and 141. Including adjacent communities, the study area covers approximately 15 square miles.\n\nThe proposed updates would transform Kirkwood Highway into a more balanced transportation system with enhanced safety for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians while supporting economic growth and community development, according to WILMAPCO.\n\nDuring the workshop, officials stressed the need for public feedback to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive planning process.\n\nConverting Kirkwood Highway from a 'stroad' to street or road\n\nKirkwood Highway is marked by a unique combination of commercial and residential zones shaped by population changes and urbanization. Running as a four-to-six-lane divided highway between Newark and Wilmington, the western section is characterized by low-density development, parks and small strip malls adjoining suburban neighborhoods. In contrast, the eastern end transitions through major shopping hubs like Prices Corner and institutional landmarks such as the Wilmington VA Medical Center before passing through Elsmere.\n\nGoals of the study seek to resolve key challenges related to accessing and traveling along the corridor. However, the design of Kirkwood Highway is a major complicating factor for potential changes.\n\nTransportation experts classify the highway as a \"stroad,\" a hybrid between a street and a road that serves neither purpose well. Their solution is to reconfigure sections of DE 2 to function either as a proper street or a road.\n\nPublic input is sought in eight categories, including public transportation, intersections, specific roads and connecting routes.\n\nPAINTING THE TOWN:A new mural art project in Wilmington takes a 'roaring' look at the Jazz Age\n\nThe study pinpointed the most dangerous areas as the SR 141 junction, the Price's Corner area, and the intersection at Limestone Road (SR 7). Notably, SR 7 was identified as the most congested intersection in the study corridor, recording the highest number of crashes and the second highest in WILMAPCO’s statewide crash rankings.\n\nBeyond these major trouble spots, the presentation also highlighted six additional intersections that need comprehensive study due to specific safety and traffic flow challenges:\n\nPossum Park Road to address crash history and pedestrian accessibility Brewster Drive to address history of U-turn issues occurrences Green Valley to address history of U-turn occurrences Meadowood Drive to address crash history and pedestrian accessibility SR 100 (Dupont Road) to address intersection complexities SR 100 (DuPont Road) to address crash history\n\nA reconfiguration of the SR 141 interchange and a bypass of the railroad crossing at Centerville Road and Newport Gap Pike is also being considered.\n\nDespite projected population decline, there's room for new housing\n\nThe study plan reveals the impacted area is home to around 45,000 residents and supports 17,000 jobs. Although population projections indicate a potential decrease over the next 30 years, planners have identified a need for about 1,000 new housing units, particularly workforce housing. They suggest these units could be developed by repurposing certain existing commercial spaces.\n\nPresentation materials, surveys and recordings are available on WILMAPCO’s website.

For example, one route, Route 5, which includes stops from Rodney Square to Christiana Mall, would turn early on Ninth Street and no longer go to the park, a busy transit spot in the city.\n\nJohn Sisson, DTC's CEO, said the Route 5 change would add eight one-way trips to the afternoon service, increasing frequencies from 30 to 20 minutes for the route that runs Monday through Friday.\n\nSisson said he will use the feedback from upcoming sessions to make any needed adjustments to the proposed route changes that his agency plans to enact in January. He said the public hearings at the Wilmington library on Oct. 28 and the Newark library on Oct. 29 will follow the open houses to gain more feedback.\n\nRobert Smith takes the bus to travel from his home in north Wilmington to work at the Home Depot in Claymont.\n\nSmith said he'd like to see an extension of the service hours to either midnight or 1 a.m. He said he often doesn't get off work until 11 p.m.\n\n\"I got to depend on taxis,\" he said.\n\nThe proposed route changes will also soon be posted in buses.\n\nThe route proposals are the result of nearly a year's work by various state and local groups seeking to improve rider experience. A part of their work culminated in the Wilmington Transit \"Moving Forward\" report, which among many other long-term proposals calls for route tweaks.\n\nThe report, which Sisson said has received positive feedback from figures such as Wilmington Chief Of Staff Cleon Cauley and Delaware Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt, is available at wilmapco.org/wilmtransitmoveforward.\n\nThe report includes so-called principles, or broad lists of proposed changes to the transit system over a period of more than 10 years. The principles include suggestions to deploy more environmentally friendly buses, improved bus technology to better assist riders and expand bus services.\n\n\"This is kind of like a first step,\" Sisson said, adding that the route changes can be enacted more quickly than the report's other suggestions.\n\nSisson said the proposals try to improve rider access to workplaces, boost ride frequencies and improve scheduling. He said the changes will cost little money because they will be made up of rearrangements.\n\n\"It's just putting the resources where they belong,\" Sisson said.\n\nContact Yann Ranaivo at (302) 324-2837, yranaivo@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @YannRanaivo.\n\nWorkshop schedule\n\nThe Delaware Transit Corporation is hosting two upcoming open houses on changes to DART bus routes:\n\nSept. 23: 4 p.m. -7 p.m., Wilmington Public Library, 10 E. 10th St., Wilmington.\n\nSept. 25: 4 p.m.-6 p.m., WILMAPCO, 850 Library Ave., Newark.\n\nProposed route changes\n\nHere is a list of proposed DART route changes. Current maps and descriptions of the routes below can be found at http://bit.ly/1mgrks5.\n\nRoute 1: Would serve the Amtrak station, using Walnut Street to 12th Street, instead of Orange Street. Would no serve Rodney Square.\n\nRoute 5: Also not stopping in Rodney Square, it would turn from Orange Street to Ninth Street. Outbound trips would begin at King and Ninth streets. Eight one-way trips would be added to afternoon bus service, increasing frequencies from 30 to 20 minutes.\n\nRoute 6: Turns from 11th Street onto French Street, no longer serving the Amtrak station. Twenty-two one-way trips would be added to alleviate crowding and increase frequencies from Prices Corner to Wilmington, and from Newark to Prices Corner.\n\nRoute 7: Adds direct service to Trolley Square area, but no longer serves Rodney Square.\n\nRoutes 16 and 42: Add stops at the I-95 service plaza.\n\nRoutes 19, 30 and 36: Combines routes to form a new DART Route 18 between Pike Creek and Wilmington along Milltown and Faulkland Roads, with connections at Prices Corner Park and Ride. Would no longer serve Limestone Road between Del. 4 in Stanton to Milltown Road.\n\nRoutes 17, 22 and 25: Would access downtown via Walnut Street instead of Orange Street, turning on 12th Street back to King Street.\n\nRoute 25: Routing change to Delaware City via Tybouts Corner Park-and-Ride. Would no longer serve Del. 9 and Hamburg Road, using U.S. 13 and Del. 72 to provide service to Mid-County Wrangle Hill Park-and-Ride and new DMV facility.\n\nRoute 28: All trips would use Broom Street, providing local service to A.I. DuPont Hospital and Nemours Clinic, discontinuing service along Augustine Cutoff.\n\nRoute 33: Sunday service would be implemented on the segment from Christiana Mall to Newark only.\n\nRoute 34: All trips from Marrows Road replaced by DART Route 55, allowing DART Route 34 to provide more direct service between Newark and Christiana, serving Comcast/Wakefield Drive, University Plaza, Old Main Street in downtown Christiana ending at Christiana Mall.\n\nRoute 44: A new route would convert \"not in service\" buses to express buses between Mid-County Wrangle Hill Park-and-Ride and new DMV facility to Christiana Mall.\n\nRoutes 46 and 55: Splits existing DART Route 55 into two segments for schedule reliability: Glasgow-Newark (new DART Route 46) and Newark-Christiana Mall (DART Route 55), with no extensions to Wilmington.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/09/13/wilmington-wants-your-help-creating-its-vision-2028/661644001/", "title": "Wilmington seeks public help developing 10-year plan", "text": "Note: This story has been updated to include the estimated cost of the city's consultant, Interface Studio LLC.\n\nWilmington is beginning a year-long effort to come up with a comprehensive plan that will guide development across the city for the next 10 years.\n\nOfficials are seeking public input for the plan, called Wilmington 2028, the city said in a news release.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki said the plan will address current challenges and develop \"a new vision for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"This will be a community-driven effort which I would like to see reflect the hopes and priorities of our citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"This plan will guide future development, and shape where and why public and private investment dollars are spent to make Wilmington a stronger and more prosperous city over the next decade.”\n\nThe plan, managed by City Planning Director Herb Inden, is required by a Delaware law that states all municipalities must have a comprehensive plan in place that is reviewed and updated every 10 years.\n\nThe most recent plan on the city's website was adopted in 2003, updated in August 2009 and was certified by the state in 2010, the mayor's office said.

In early 2018, focus groups will address specific issues and make recommendations. Preliminary recommendations will be submitted to the public for feedback in the spring of next year, the city said, and a draft of the new comprehensive plan will be shared with citizens in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe mayor and planning department selected a 21-member steering committee to review the initial findings of the projects' research phase and help guide public engagement and plan development phases.

After getting public input, the planners will choose one of the three proposals and then seek DelDOT funding.\n\nThe purpose is to divert traffic from cars exiting I-495, said WILMAPCO planner Dave Gula.\n\nCurrently, drivers going downtown from I-495's 12th Street exit either take Vandever Avenue to Route 13, or drive south on Northeast Boulevard into East Side streets. Both of those routes cause significant traffic in mostly residential areas, Gula said.\n\nPlanners are hoping the traffic would flow into an extended 12th Street instead, which they are also designing to be pedestrian- and bike-friendly so that residents can use it to access proposed parks and other development along the river.\n\nTwo of the street plans align with the two proposed redevelopment plans.\n\nSean Garrigan of Stromberg/Garrigan and Associates, the firm drafting the redevelopment proposals, said he plans to wait for WILMAPCO to choose its preferred road design so the firm can choose a corresponding redevelopment plan.\n\nA report on recommended redevelopment plans is due to the city by the end of March.\n\nRedevelopment has been anticipated for over two decades in the neighborhood, which has disproportionately high rates of poverty and unemployment and an aging building stock.\n\nThe state established the Riverfront Development Corp. in 1995 to redevelop the Brandywine and Christina waterfronts. When Mayor Mike Purzycki was executive director of the group, plans along the Brandywine were put on hold in favor of the Christina riverfront.\n\nResidents hope to be part of Brandywine waterfront redevelopment\n\nThe redevelopment proposals include over 100 new 1- and 2-bedroom market-rate apartment units from Spruce Street to Locust Street, a trail and park along the riverfront, and retail units on North Market and Hutton streets.

Planners are now crafting suggestions for an overlay – which is a set of regulations that would protect the resources and characteristics identified by the designation.\n\nThose characteristics are both aesthetic and more tangible, like the watershed itself and historic properties like what is left of the paper mill industry in Yorklyn.\n\nThe byway’s narrow roads wind between steep slopes and thick forests, through covered bridges and across ridge lines with scenic views of meadows below. But the countryside character and short hop from Wilmington is also very attractive to those looking for place to live. This has some residents fearing the area’s character will be marred by development.\n\n“This is not necessarily bad,” said John Gaadt, a consultant hired for the effort, as he showed those attending a public workshop a photo of a housing development in the area called Videre Woods. “I kind of refer to this as suburban creep. What we see over time is a little bit of the byway changing ... The question is, is this going to protect what we are trying to protect and enhance?”\n\nHeather Dunigan, a transportation planner with the Wilmington Area Planning Council, which is partnering with several other organizations on the project, said the area has a standard suburban zoning so there is a disconnect between what is allowed and what would be considered in the area’s character.\n\n“You can’t stop progress, but it shouldn’t be seen from the road,” said one resident at the workshop.\n\nMuch of the discussion at the public workshop, which was the first of many to gather input from residents, centered around aspects of the area that can be enhanced and what residents see as potential threats.\n\n“I live near the Mt. Cuba observatory and the light is really becoming a problem,” said resident Cindy Gamble.\n\nOther discussions included deer fences, how homes should look in the area, traffic and a particularly unsightly yellow home sticking out atop a hill.\n\n“There is no direct way through here and that is part of the character,” said resident Bill Kissell.\n\nResidents also discussed the need for greater hiking access to Hoopes Reservoir and returning the various waterways in the watershed to a more natural flow\n\n“With the beauty and the hills, it is an ideal place for bikes if there were no cars,” one resident opined.\n\nThe end product will take the form of suggestions for how code should dictate things like what types of developments are allowed and how far homes should be set back from the road. The recommendations will be used by the county to craft rules which must be ratified by council, county land use officials said.\n\n“Everybody loves the byway as it is and they don’t want anything to change,” said resident Bill Bizjak.\n\nThe next public workshop will be held in spring. The process is being funded by a WILMAPCO grant and will take between 8 months to a year to complete.\n\nFor more information visit www.wilmapco.org/redclay\n\nContact Staff Writer Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 orxwilson@delawareonline.com.

A bar sits along the street's intersection with Foulk Road, and four schools lie about a mile or less from the stretch of roadway.\n\nBut Grubb Road between Majestic Drive and Country Gates Drive has no sidewalk, no paved shoulder, and hedges that sprout up directly next to the roadway in places. For about a decade, residents and state officials have tossed about plans to build a sidewalk so that pedestrians can safely walk.\n\nBut disagreements over where to place it have kept the idea from materializing.\n\n\"Everybody wants the same thing. We need a freaking sidewalk, it's dangerous ... if you're walking up the street,\" said Mike Kiernan, an independent contractor who lives on Grubb Road. \"It's just nobody wants it on their side of the street ... and I don't really want it on my side of the street either.\"\n\nAs a result of the disagreement, officials said, the Grubb Road sidewalk was the only planned future project to be removed from the Wilmington Area Planning Council's recent $2.3 billion priority list for transportation projects.\n\nApproximately $550,000 had been directed to fund engineering and right-of-way purchases for sidewalk construction on Grubb Road last year, said Heather Dunigan, principal planner at WILMAPCO.\n\nThat funding has been rescinded.\n\n\"It's an area where people need to walk but have nowhere to do it safely,\" said Dunigan. But \"my understanding is (DelDOT) removed the funds because they didn't feel there was consensus\" among residents.\n\nAlong with the Delaware Department of Transportation, WILMAPCO plans roads, bridges and transit projects that are partially federally-funded in New Castle County.\n\nNow that the Grubb Road sidewalk project has been removed from the WILMAPCO's priority list, it won't be funded for at least three years, said Drew Boyce, DelDOT's director of planning.\n\nThe project has not been scrapped, however, he said, as it has been placed on another DelDOT project wishlist, called the Capital Transportation Plan. Now, it is one of numerous unfunded projects on that queue.\n\n\"We still think it's a viable transportation project,\" said Boyce. \"Just because it's hard (to gather consensus) doesn't mean we're not going to try again.\"\n\nSTORY: Man injured after fall from bike in Brandywine Hundred\n\nSTORY: New Castle County seeks solution for historical homes\n\nNew Castle County Councilman Robert Weiner, who has been an advocate of a sidewalk for years, said transportation officials should not have allowed a \"minority\" of vocal residents to ax the project. DelDOT's role, he said, is not to achieve a complete consensus but rather to move forward with projects that will increase the safety of residents.\n\n\"Brandywine Hundred citizens have been shortchanged,\" Weiner said. \"A few people's contrary opinions should not dissuade DelDOT from moving forward with a plan the majority supports.\"\n\nJoe Iacono, a landscaper and Grubb Road resident, noted that a sidewalk could increase home values along the road, in addition to safety benefits.\n\n\"It's not going to affect anybody's curb appeal in my eyes,\" he said. \"A sidewalk or a bike path is beneficial.\"\n\nKiernan said he other neighbors do worry about burglaries in the area, and a sidewalk could make it easier for thieves to \"scope out\" a home.\n\nAfter a few minutes of contemplation, however, he noted that no one is ever going to be completely satisfied.\n\n\"You almost want (a sidewalk) to go on both sides of the street...then nobody can complain,\" Kiernan said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Unofficially, there were 5,506 \"yes\" votes and 2,102 \"no\" votes.\n\nThe department will certify the results of the referendum at 2 p.m. Thursday, said Elections Unit Manager Barbara Lippincott.\n\nAppoquinimink Board President Richard Forsten said the overwhelming \"victory\" was realized through a well thought-out plan and volunteers getting the word out in all communities in the district.\n\n\"The district put a lot of time and thought into the planning that went into this, and the voters responded,\" Forsten said. \"We work awfully hard as a school board and care very much about education in this district. Education is one, if not the most important, thing government can do, and we want to continue to be a good school district.\"\n\nAppoquinimink Superintendent Matt Burrows said the real work begins now that the community has put its faith in the district, deemed the fastest-growing in the state.\n\n\"We have to use the money we were granted wisely,\" he said. \"The community came out and spoke tonight, and they deserve nothing but the best from us. We will now hit the ground running. We have three new schools to build.\"\n\nBecause of the growth the school district has seen in the past and is predicting in the future, officials saw a need to host a two-part referendum – one ballot item sought funding to build and expand schools, while the other sought funds for operational expenses.\n\nIn the last two years, Appoquinimink School District – which largely encompasses Middletown, Odessa and Townsend – has added 766 students. Since 2006, the district has 3,082 additional students and has a current enrollment of 10,644. Last year alone saw a more than 500-student increase.\n\nThat growth will continue as the population in the Appoquinimink School District is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades, from 66,429 people in 2015 to 89,892 people by 2025 and 107,206 people by 2035, according to WILMAPCO, a federally designated metropolitan planning organization used by the district to project growth.\n\nThe district will now be able to build a 1,600-student high school and 1,000-student middle school on the Fairview Campus, where they will join the existing kindergarten center and elementary school. This will create the first K-12 campus in the state.\n\nA new 840-student elementary school is also planned in the town of Whitehall on land that was donated to the district.\n\nThe district also has plans to redesign and expand Everett Meredith Middle School to allow for 1,000 students and to renovate Silver Lake Elementary School.\n\nSTORY: Residents feel forced out of Magnolia development\n\nSTORY: Middletown students pull of Wreaths Across America welcome\n\nAs a stop-gap measure, the district has added trailers to two middle schools and an elementary school, but temporary solutions were costly, with nearly $1 million spent and leasing fees.\n\nCedar Lane Elementary School and the district’s two high schools also repurposed spaces as classrooms, moved to “on-a-cart” instruction and are currently sharing rooms.\n\nThe price tag to fund the capital improvements is a little more than $268 million, of which 25 percent ($67.1 million) will be paid for by taxpayers through the referendum and 75 percent paid for by the state. That equates to 8.54 cents per $100 of assessed home value, which will range from about $5 a month for a house valued at $150,000 to about $14 a month for a home valued at $450,000.\n\nAppoquinimink was one of only two school districts to be approved for capital support from the state among five that applied this year. The state prioritized districts that showed critical enrollment issues.\n\nThe second question on the ballot sought $3.1 million for such things as teacher recruitment and retention, technology and operating expenses. The tax impact for this part is 15 cents per $100 assessed value of a home.\n\nMiddletown High Principal Matthew Donovan said before the referendum vote that he believes great outcomes require great teachers and support staff. He also said more funding was needed to attract and retain good teachers.\n\n\"We ask so much more from our teachers every day. Keeping quality teachers here is important,” he said. “The worst thing that can happen after they’ve practiced, become refined and are successful, is they leave. The investment in that teacher is lost if they go somewhere else.”\n\nSome of the money will be used for technology.\n\n“Learning, and especially 21st-century learning, is different than when most parents went to school,” Burrows said. “You are seeing more devices. Learning is no longer just happening between the four walls of the school building. It’s happening at home. It’s happening at the coffee shop. Learning is happening almost 24/7 because of student connectivity to the devices. We need to prepare our kids for the jobs that are out there and the jobs we don’t even know exist at this point as they move forward.\"\n\nWith the referendum passing, taxpayers will pay 23.54 cents per $100 of their home's value, which could be anywhere from $9 a month ($150,000 home) to $27 a month ($450,000 home).\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

It's connected to the rest of Claymont by a single, two-lane road, Myrtle Avenue.\n\nOn weekdays, riders pack the 430-space lot, which serves as \"overflow\" parking for Wilmington's station. If the main lot is full, motorists must drive back out to Philadelphia Pike and seek street parking along Governor Printz Boulevard Extended. The secondary parking area connects to the main lot by an aging pedestrian bridge over I-495.\n\n\"If we had sidewalks and lighting as you walk from the pedestrian bridge to and from Philadelphia Pike, that would really be an improvement,\" said Jillian Waldman, a teacher at Archmere Academy who commutes from her home in North Philly.\n\n\"The path is trash covered and poorly lit. Then, a car crashed at the corner right there two weeks ago, and it's really made me nervous.\"\n\nCommuters huddle beneath retrofitted bus shelters on the platform to escape storms. A narrow pedestrian tunnel to reach the northbound platform floods during storms, requiring a generator and heavy-duty pumps to make it passable. With no elevators, officials overhauled wheelchair lifts in the tunnel in 2013.\n\n\"The lifts are very slow,\" said Dave Gula, a senior planner with the Wilmington Area Planning Council. \"It barely meets basic requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"\n\nPlatform relocation\n\nNew riders notice that trains arriving in Claymont lean at a disconcerting angle. That's because the tracks are canted due to the platforms' location along a curve in the railroad line, making for difficult boarding.\n\n\"The train leans toward you. It takes a little effort to get up on it because it's leaning so much,\" said Robert Cameron, who lives in the Ashburn Hills community and takes SEPTA two or three times a week to shop at Reading Terminal Market.\n\nA 2010 study recommended a station building on the northbound side of the tracks, north of the curve.\n\n\"That would mean going into the Evraz steel grounds,\" said Cartier, who represents Claymont.\n\n\"When that sale eventually goes through, we could have the real possibility of relocating the rail stop on a straight part of the tracks. I requested of the developer that they make accommodations for relocation of the rail site.\"\n\nThe 2010 study, commissioned by WILMAPCO, also called for high-level platforms, weather-protected canopies on the inbound and outbound platforms, a ticket office, elevators, sidewalks and lighting for pedestrians in the lot and along Myrtle Avenue.\n\nThe overall project (without a parking garage) was estimated at $16 million, Gula said.\n\nThat estimate doesn't include an additional point of access for the station – potentially through the Evraz site – that would ease congestion along Myrtle and Philadelphia Pike during peak hours. That would be a relief to Pat Bennett and other frustrated neighbors.\n\n\"People fly down that road, throw their cars in park and race to catch the train. The scary part is the school kids have to stand there at the entrance to the station to get the school bus,\" Bennett said.\n\nStation advocates are frustrated by the loss of state funding, but hope to convince officials to restore that support after securing a commitment from Jostes' team.\n\n\"That's probably the better approach,\" said Sisson of DTC. \"You don't want to spend a ton of money, then turn around and say, 'Wow, if we'd waited two years, we could have done a better development here.' \"\n\nSaddler is optimistic, noting the county is launching a study of transportation in northern Claymont, including the Tri-State Mall area and the potential spin-off effects from an expansion of a former Sunoco Refinery in Marcus Hook.\n\n\"Sales at Darley Green [community] are strong. Young professionals are moving in, and we're seeing a ripple effect in other neighborhoods in Claymont,\" Saddler said. \"Few focus areas in the county have the potential for this much growth in such a short period of time.\"\n\nOfficials attempted to apply for a $1.9 million federal grant to fund the station design and environmental studies last year, but technical difficulties delayed the application, said Gula of WILMAPCO, sponsor of the application.\n\nWhile the project had state and local support, it lacked a financial commitment from New Castle County and, therefore, might not have been competitive nationally. \"We sent endorsement letters in, but I don't think we pulled together the matching funds,\" Cartier said.\n\nThe project might be a grant candidate again this year but faces competition from a Wilmington transit project, Gula said.\n\n\"We've been so behind in our transportation infrastructure funding that there's a scarcity of capital for transportation projects,\" said state Sen. Harris B. McDowell III, D-North Wilmington.\n\n\"The Claymont station is a primary part of the transportation system in northern Delaware. It should get done.\"\n\nContact Melissa Nann Burke at (302) 324-2329, mburke@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @nannburke.\n\nCOMMUTER RAIL RIDERSHIP\n\nSEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line (R2) service in Delaware began operating to Wilmington in 1989, adding stops in Claymont in 1991, Newark in 1997 and Churchmans Crossing in 2000.\n\nAt Claymont, the most northern station stop in Delaware, fire destroyed the train station in the late 1980s. It was closed from 1982 to 1990, with service restored in 1991. Retrofitted bus shelters are in place on the platforms.\n\nWeekday ridership averaged 1,120 last year. Claymont is the busiest train stop in Delaware, behind Wilmington.\n\nSources: DelDOT, Delaware Transit Corp., WILMAPCO and SEPTA", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/20"}]}

A number of festivals have folded, others have moved from fall to spring and some are scheduled to happen this year for for the first time since 2019.\n\nLet's hope that 2022 is the year things regain a sense of normalcy, because a record slate (or something close to it) of fall festivals is on tap for New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender counties, celebrating everything from food and drink to arts and culture(s), the environment and more.\n\nAt any rate, COVID willing and the hurricanes don't blow, here's what's going down festival-wise between now and Thanksgiving, with at least four Oktoberfests, two Latino festivals and the first Wilmington Riverfest since 2019.\n\nMore:Wilmington breweries are teaming up with local artists and bands, with cool results\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nWilmington RockFest\n\nSept. 9-10: It's more of an end-of-summer thing, really, but it's after Labor Day so the first ever Wilmington RockFest is going in the fall batch. Ten bands will play over the course of two nights at the Lookout At Iron Front, which is once again hosting rock shows (and other events) and reclaiming the mantle of past clubs that put on shows in the Front Street space, legendary names like The Skylight and The Starlight.\n\nWilmington has a long history of churning out hard rock acts, and RockFest will feature such up-and-coming Port City headbangers as Hyperloops and Giant Robot Academy.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m. each night, details and tickets on EventBrite.com.\n\nCarolina Beach Dragon Boat ​Regatta\n\nSept. 16-17: It'll technically be the last weekend of summer when this community event takes place. But we like to be inclusive with our fall festivals, and how could we not include this one-of-a-kind event that features costumed teams racing dragon-themed boats? Some live tunes will be on tap to keep spectators entertained, and attendance is free.\n\nKickoff party is 6 p.m. Sept. 16 at the Seawitch Cafe and Tiki Bar, with races starting 8:30 a.m. Sept. 17 in the waters of the Carolina Beach Yacht Basin. Finals will start around 3 p.m. Sept. 17, followed by a ceremony recognizing the first place teams in each division, the ones with the most spirit, best costumes and the best all-women team. CarolinaBeachDragonBoatRegetta.org\n\nNative Plant Festival\n\nSept. 17: Learn about plants native to Southeastern North Carolina — aka the plants that are easiest to care for and thrive in our environment — and even purchase a few for your yard at this free-to-attend festival.\n\nEducational events will be held 10 a.m.-3 p.m. at the New Hanover County Arboretum, with hands-on activities from exhibitors and experts speaking about topics each hour in the education center, including a 1 p.m. keynote address from N.C. State professor Madalyn Baldwin on coastal landscape design. Plus, there will be a \"seed swap\" booth with free seeds and a food truck on site.\n\nPlants won't be on sale at the arboretum but rather at five off-site locations: Blooms+Branches, Carolina Girl Nursery, The Garden Shop, Shelton Herb Farm and Wild Bird and Garden.

Oyster Festival\n\nOct. 15-16: This long-running celebration of the delicious bivalve started back in 1978, and got popular quickly enough that by 1980 it had attracted NASCAR legend Richard Petty as a celebrity guest.

The Franklin Institute debuts \"Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes\": Kids of all sizes will like this trip to the museum. Opening April 13, this new exhibit will offer up more than 300 artifacts from Marvel Comics, including pages, costumes and props. Organizers say to expect \"a fully immersive design with life-size scenes straight from the comic world,\" rare comics and artwork, including original art for Spider-Man’s origin story. They add: \"Interactive elements including the opportunity to travel through the mysterious mirror dimension of Doctor Strange, digitally transform into Iron Man and pose for selfies alongside life-size representations of Black Panther, Spider-Man and other iconic Marvel characters.\"\n\n4. The opening of Wilmington's DE.CO Food Hall: When will this happen? Your guess is as good as ours. The $3.5-million project — a collaboration between Wilmington's Buccini/Pollin Group and Seawall Development, a company that developed Baltimore’s R. House food hall — was supposed to be open by late 2018. Heck, in August they floated in a newsletter that \"almost all of the stalls are full with chefs working on building their menus and kitchens, but we can't say who just yet!\" Whenever it does open at the DuPont Building (10th and Orange), the 12,000-square-foot space, able to seat 250, should especially be buzzing during the downtown lunch rush. Eight different kitchens are expected, along with a bar. Officials say it certainly won't be open by spring, but chef announcements should start riolling out in the first squartyer of the year.\n\n5. “Costuming THE CROWN”opens at Winterthur: Opening March 30 and running into early 2020, Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library will host a dream exhibition for fans of the Netflix series \"The Crown.\" Get up close and personal with 40 costumes from the show, which snagged an Emmy Award for Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth II on the program. (The show returns for a third season in 2019.) Everything from Queen Elizabeth’s coronation robe to Princess Margaret’s wedding dress will be represented.\n\n6. The opening of U.S. 301: The new cashless toll road is expected to open Jan.1. If you don't have E-Z Pass, you'll get a bill in the mail because your license plate is scanned as you drive by. The new $636 million interstate, which runs 15 miles from Del. 1 to the Delaware/Maryland border, has four lanes. More than 14,000 vehicles are expected each day when cars start rumbling down the long-awaited roadway.\n\n7. Opening of Wilmington's 76ers Fieldhouse: If you have been counting the days until you could finally root for the Delaware Blue Coats in their new Wilmington home, keep counting. The NBA G league team, formerly the Delaware 87ers, had hoped to christen the 76ers Fieldhouse on U.S. 13 on Jan. 4. Construction delays at the $30 million, 2,500-person arena have pushed that moment back to Jan. 23. In the meantime, the Blue Coats will play Jan. 9 and 11 at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.\n\n8. Food Bank of Delaware moves: The nonprofit agency that fights hunger in Delaware is now ready to make the leap. The Food Bank of Delaware will move its warehouse from a 42,500-square-foot facility in Ogeltown to a new 80,000-square foot home at 222 Lake Drive in Pencader Corporate Center in nearby Glasgow. They purchased the building three years ago and are currently retrofitting it. It will also house their culinary school, which will be able to double in size. Donate at fbd.org to help fill the new warehouse.\n\n9. Delaware Art Museum's new Loper exhibit: The work of late Wilmington artist Edward Loper Sr. will sit alongside that of his son Edward Loper Jr. for a new exhibit called \"The Loper Tradition.\" Starting March 23, their paintings will be paired for the first time, drawn from the collections of the Delaware Art Museum, other public institutions, local corporations and private individuals. The elder Loper, who died in 2011 at 95, broke racial barriers as the first African-American to have a painting accepted at what is now the Delaware Art Museum.\n\n10. New-look Firefly Music Festival debuts with AEG as sole owner: Four years after concert giant AEG partnered with Firefly's founders Red Frog Events, AEG bought out Red Frog earlier this year and is running the show solo. Its first big move — announcing the 2019 Dover lineup — was somewhat underwhelming, with plenty of fans griping about the lineup headed by Panic! at the Disco, Travis Scott and Post Malone. (Not that whining about the lineup doesn't happen every year.) The real verdict will come June 21-23 when The Woodlands fills up and the beats start to drop.\n\n11. The 40th anniversary of Yuletide at Winterthur: The annual holiday tour of Henry Francis du Pont’s mansion marks its fourth decade starting in November. This past year's tour included everything from an 18-room dollhouse mansion to a display of antique Santas.\n\n12. Cupid’s Undie Run at The Queen: Get your tighty-whities ready for a good cause.

A decision on the future of Dewey Beach's northbeach: It's been more than two months since we were supposed to have a decision on the waterfront club owned by Dewey Beach Lions Club. A membership vote was held in late October to determine who would run the spot in early 2020 when the current lease runs up. Why is everyone so interested? Not only is it an iconic, hard-partying bar that draws major crowds in the summer, but two of the town's biggest bar owners are gunning for the property, pitting current owners Highway One Group against the team from The Starboard. Dewey Beach Lions Club has not returned calls for an update since the October vote.\n\n15. Sea Witch Halloween & Fiddlers' Festival turns 30: The three-day free Halloween festival that brings everyone back to the beach for boos instead of barbecues will have its 30th anniversary Oct. 25-27. Rehoboth and Dewey beaches will be filled with families for the weekend's costume parades, bonfires, broom-tossing contests, beach games and fiddlers' festival.\n\n16.

The one-act opera delves into the friendship between Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the late Antonin Scalia. To round out the festival, check out Gilbert & Sullivan's courtroom comedy \"Trial By Jury.\"\n\n18. Middletown gets its own Two Stones Pub: That's right. The guys behind 2SP Brewing Co. — the brewery that recently made a collaborative coffee stout with Wawa — are opening their fourth brewpub in Delaware. Located in Hedgelawn Plaza off U.S. 301, owners say the taps will be flowing at the 4,766-square-foot, 200-person watering hole and restaurant by March or April. The Middletown location will join other Delaware Two Stones Pub locations in Hockessin, Brandywine Hundred and the Newark area.\n\n19. Dover International Speedway celebrates 50 years of NASCAR: It was July 6, 1969 when NASCAR driver Richard Petty won the first NASCAR race on the Monster Mile. For 2019, the track will feature two NASCAR triple-header weekends (May 3-5 and Oct. 4-6). Every Monster Trophy in 2019 will be gold-colored as a symbol of the 50th and both weekends will feature special appearances by legendary drivers, free concerts and an expanded game-filled FanZone to help mark the occasion.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The 111-acre course finally was sold to developer Louis Capano III in 2012 and ceased operations three years after.\n\nNow, Capano wants to use the grounds to build 408 apartment units in 12 three- to four-story buildings and 155 new homes ranging from small townhouses to larger single-family lots. The land's current zoning will allow less than half of that, so Capano plans to ask New Castle County Council to approve a rezoning in the coming year.\n\nNeighbors accustomed to a relatively quiet place say they will fight to stop that rezoning in an effort to protect their piece of Brandywine Hundred, Delaware's oldest and most densely populated suburb.\n\nThey fear two-lane roads will be overloaded with traffic. They abhor the thought of losing open space that for 70 years was a golf course. And they worry the apartments will change the neighborhood's character with renters, who have less invested in their community.\n\nCapano said Brandywine Hundred is overdue for new apartment construction and maintains that the country club parcel is one of the last in the area where such a large project can meet booming demand from both millennials and older residents.\n\n\"Really there is no hole in the doughnut other than probably Brandywine Country Club and some redevelopments like Concord Plaza,\" Capano said. \"It is just dead. There are no large pieces of land.\"\n\nSheila Meara's backyard looks onto the golf course's 11th fairway. Over her 26 years living there, she became accustomed to the beauty in her backyard and even learned to play the game herself.\n\nIf Capano has his way, her backyard view will be transformed from the bucolic green of a golf course to the hardscape of asphalt and concrete when a two-lane boulevard is built to bisect the new housing development.\n\n\"It is very sad to see it go. I understand it happens,\" Meara said. \"But now it is being developed in a way that – I don't want to say greedy – but it seems like overkill.\"\n\nSTORY: With land limited, builders target Delaware golf courses\n\nSTORY: Push to redevelop old Hercules golf course begins anew\n\nCapano said he believes the plan is \"harmonious\" with the community because it transitions from the large, three- to four-story apartment buildings near Concord Pike to the smaller homes in the middle of the property and the single-family homes closer to Shipley Road.\n\n\"Of course, it is a business decision, and we are in the apartment business so that obviously lends itself to why we would like to build apartments,\" said Capano, whose company manages some 4,000 apartments throughout New Castle County. \"But we do think it fits into the community, and it is a thoughtful plan — not just a plan to make money.\"\n\nThe plan also includes the commercial reconfiguration of Capano's 200,000-square-foot Concord Square shopping center next door to the course on Concord Pike that is anchored by Giant grocery store and Marshalls.\n\nA portion of the shopping center's main building would be torn down to make way for the new boulevard stretching from Concord Pike through the new development to Shipley Road. To replace that lost retail space, two 5,500 square-foot commercial buildings would be situated in center's expansive and underused parking lot off Concord Pike.\n\nThe plan also calls for construction of a new 10,000-square-foot commercial building behind the existing shopping center near the planned apartments, and all of this would be wrapped together by sidewalks and special pedestrian crossings intended to make the center an attractive, walkable place for the apartment dwellers, homeowners inside the development and other nearby residents.\n\nCapano's plans to cluster the apartments near the shopping center's commercial offerings is similar to the recently approved redevelopment of the Concord Plaza office complex just south Capano's property.\n\nDeveloper Buccini/Pollin Group plans to reformat that underused office complex by building 340 luxury apartments in six new buildings ranging from four to five stories. Three of those buildings will feature ground-floor shops and restaurants with apartments on the floors above. The plan also includes new office space.\n\nCouncilman Bob Weiner, who represents the area, said Concord Plaza and the commercial aspect of the country club development harken back to villagelike developments that predate the automobile-dominated area.\n\nSTORY: Concord Plaza redevelopment off U.S. 202 given green light\n\nSTORY: DuPont Country Club's future in doubt to neighbors\n\nWeiner said the Concord Pike corridor was developed in the post-World War II expansion of suburban development north of Wilmington where the village model eventually was cast aside for strip malls where motorists were the only \"first-class citizens.\"\n\n\"It was developed in what was then the style of the day, which was a sea of asphalt parking lot that required an automobile to get to where you buy your milk and then drive somewhere else to do laundry, then somewhere else to get coffee,\" said Weiner, who emphasized his comments were addressing the commercial concepts of the plan, not his still-developing views on the suitability of the total country club development proposal.\n\n\"The demands of today are going back to the past, where people want a village with these mix of uses.\"\n\nTraffic is a concern\n\nWhile final plans have not yet been filed with the county, some 200 concerned residents blistered Capano and his cadre of attorneys and engineers at a public meeting recently when they presented the plan.\n\nTheir complaints ranged from impact to local schools, fears about stormwater runoff and an unwillingness to see the open space built over. The primary fear vocalized was the \"traffic nightmare\" hundreds of new residents would bring to the densely populated area off Shipley Road – a two-lane thoroughfare that runs roughly parallel to Concord Pike from Penny Hill to Naamans Road, sandwiching the club property.\n\nPaul Steiner lives in nearby Pierson Farms and said it can take two to three minutes just to wade through traffic to get on Shipley from his neighborhood.\n\n\"By the time the cars stop coming from the left now they are coming from the right,\" Steiner said. \"That is before you put in 700 new residents that need to leave at rush hour in the morning. It is just not feasible.\"\n\nConcord Pike is a popular Pennsylvania-commuter thoroughfare and artery for its many shopping options. It sees about 50,000 trips up and down each day. For some of the 80,000 residents of Brandywine Hundred, Shipley Road is their path to avoid the traffic of the pike. That road sees about 10,000 vehicles along its busiest stretch each day.\n\nJohn Tracey, Capano's attorney, said a preliminary traffic analysis showed the development would add some 4 percent to the traffic load on Concord Pike and 14 percent to Shipley Road. The development's traffic analysis has been blessed by state regulators; the analysis found none of the nearby intersections would be considered too clogged to block the project, he said.\n\nSTORY: Millennials, boomers fuel apartment construction uptick\n\nSTORY: County park proposal would derail housing project\n\nHe said the dense plan is favorable to a smaller plan that would concentrate traffic through one entrance and exit. He noted the traffic burden is being split between Concord Pike and Shipley and a less-dense development would not have the scale to make the cut-through to Concord Pike economically feasible.\n\n\"All that traffic would only be utilizing a single entrance and that would result in higher number of peak hour trips on Shipley Road,\" he said.\n\nTracey said the two-lane boulevard through the heart of the development to tie Concord Pike with Shipley would be lined with \"traffic calming\" features to slow down vehicles.\n\nAs a longtime resident, Meara said she knows and uses shortcuts to avoid Concord Pike traffic. She fears the planned boulevard would be a popular shortcut.\n\n\"I can't imagine I'm the only one doing that,\" Meara said. \"That is the benefit of knowing your local roads – at moments you can leave that huge traffic jam behind.\"\n\nTracey said residents are more likely to cut through using Naamans Road to the north or Silverside Road to the south of the new boulevard. Meara said the boulevard will be a more attractive shortcut because there will be fewer traffic lights to contend with.\n\n\"I think it opens up a much easier cut-through in our backyards,\" Meara said.\n\nDensity and zoning\n\nSome residents have called on government to end the debate and simply buy the property for open space. It's a common thread among other large developments of open space like the proposal to build nearly 300 new residences on a former orphanage property in Ogletown.\n\nWeiner said government doesn't have the money to buy the course, even if it were for sale. And making such a purchase would create a pricey precedent.\n\n\"There is this pesky document known the U.S. Constitution that ensures people life, liberty and property,\" Weiner said tongue-in-cheek. \"So if you buy land that is zoned residential, you have a constitutional right to build homes.\"\n\nWhile the traffic approval is based on a mathematical formula, Capano's concept will require County Council to approve a rezoning, which introduces some subjectivity into the equation.\n\nUnder the current zoning, Capano's firm would be able to build approximately 1.3 dwelling units for each of the property's 111 acres. There are some ways developers can boost that, but those would get the density nowhere close to the five units per acre Capano is proposing.\n\nPragmatic residents predict the rezoning decision will dominate this development fight. John Culin, whose home backs up to the 11th hole, said their priority will be making sure the zoning change fails.\n\n\"It is a pipe dream to just leave it a park,\" Culin said. \"I understand that is not going to happen. But in this area, every development is nice, normal single-family homes. Just make the development single family.\"\n\nSTORY: WilmU to start building Concord Pike campus\n\nSTORY: Concord Plaza redevelopment off U.S. 202 given green light\n\nCapano said his firm is not attempting to maximize density, insisting that he is sensitive to community standards.\n\nCounty standards for a zoning change weigh factors like the plan's consistency with the character of the surrounding area, the zoning of nearby parcels and effect on nearby properties.\n\nOnce a formal plan is submitted, it will be reviewed by a state board involving traffic, school and other public entities with opportunity for public comment.\n\nAfterward, the proposal will go to the county's Planning Board, which will evaluate the application and again take public comment before the board and the county's planning professionals make a joint recommendation. Tracey said the earliest that could happen would be in the fall, and the plan is likely to be tweaked over the coming months.\n\nRichard Hall, the general manager of the county's Land Use Department since February, said the department's recommendation will be based on some hard measures, but also more subjective judgments by the county's planning professionals. All decisions are not a \"binary check box,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything is driven by the code, but we are not robots either,\" Hall said. \"Our staff looks at what makes sense, uses experience and precedence and what we are hearing from the community and staff members. All that rolls together.\"\n\nThat recommendation is important because it motivates the decisions of County Council members who have no ties to the country club area. If the recommendation is negative, it takes a 10-member majority of the council to approve the rezoning instead of a simple, seven-member majority.\n\nThe plan also will require a much smaller commercial rezoning to accommodate the reworking of the shopping center and one new commercial building.\n\nTracey said he will argue the plan is consistent with the county's long-term plans for growth and introduces density in a responsible way with the apartments closest to Concord Pike and the larger, single-family units closer to the neighborhoods off Shipley.\n\n\"We believe the plan, as presented and will be modified, is absolutely consistent with the goals and desires of the (county's) comprehensive development plan,\" Tracey said.\n\nMeara argued the rezoning will change residents' quality of life and tank local property values.\n\n\"It begs the question of who does that benefit,\" Meara said. \"The zoning was put in place for the protection of residents. When the request comes it to change that, it put the needs of the developer ahead of the community.\"\n\nThe future of the pike\n\nThe proposal to develop the club and rework the adjacent shopping center comes alongside several, big-ticket and smaller development projects that seek to introduce better walkability to Concord Pike.\n\nWilmington University recently won approval — along with a rare waiver from county traffic rules — to build a new campus at the intersection of Beaver Valley Road and Concord Pike. Construction is set to begin on the apartments and retail shops in Concord Plaza later this year.\n\nMike Hare, executive vice president for the Buccini-Pollin Group, which owns the former DuPont Co. and AstraZeneca office complex, said his company saw an opportunity to \"kick off\" the mixed-use theme in Brandywine Hundred. He said his company is banking on the area's \"dormant need\" for modern apartment living as well as job expansion happening at places like JPMorgan Chase's technology campus further down the pike.\n\n\"I think it is a trend that is sustainable and you will see more of,\" Hare said.\n\nCapano described Concord Pike as the best real estate in Delaware, adding that its evolution into a more pedestrian-oriented setting is \"just a matter of time.\" It's a slow process because of the layout and the multitude of small parcels that make up the commercial stretch.\n\n\"It is hard to redesign smaller parcels on Concord Pike,\" Capano said. \"You are sort of limited by land. People will take advantage of it where they can, but it is difficult.\"\n\nWeiner has for decades been working with planning groups to envision a series of walkable villages that will slowly take the place of the maze of curb cuts and strip malls along the pike. It's a slow process but one that will come to fruition with time, he said.\n\nAdded Weiner: \"We as a community no longer desire to have silos of residential, commercial and office on our main street Concord Pike.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

They blasted clear across the nursery, where her 2-year-old daughter's toys were strewn on the carpet. They burrowed into the kitchen cabinetry — and hit her teenage son and daughter.\n\nAmid their screams, \"All I could think of was, 'I'm not losing another child,'\" Williams recalled, tears spilling down her cheek.\n\nHer 18-year-old stepson — William Rollins VI, known as Lil Bill — had been gunned down two years before, another victim of Wilmington's plague of teens shooting teens. His shooter was 17.\n\nWilmington isn't Chicago or Los Angeles, Baltimore or Detroit. It is a city of less than 72,000 people known primarily as the birthplace of chemical giant DuPont and as a cozy home for big banks and Fortune 500 firms. But an Associated Press and USA TODAY Network analysis of Gun Violence Archive data — gathered from media reports and police press releases, and covering a 3½ year period through June of this year — reveals that Wilmington far and away leads the country in its rate of shootings among young people under 18.\n\n\"It's nonstop, just nonstop,\" said William Rollins V, father of the teenagers. \"Around every turn, they're taking our kids.\"\n\nOf the 10 cities with the highest teen shooting rates, most had populations of less than 250,000 people. Among them were Savannah, Georgia; Trenton, N.J.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Fort Myers, Fla.; and Richmond, Va. Chicago was the lone large-population city high on the list.\n\nPoverty and a sense of hopelessness in the most violent neighborhoods is a common thread. Syracuse, a university town that once cranked out air conditioners and televisions, now has a poverty rate of 35%.\n\nOthers, like Savannah, are deeply divided. While its antebellum mansions, gnarled live oaks and marble monuments to war heroes drew more than 13 million visitors last year, away from picture-postcard oasis of Southern Charm the scenery here quickly shifts to decaying neighborhoods, abject poverty and deadly violence.\n\nSize may play a role. In tightly packed neighborhoods, insults and perceived insults ricochet like shots in an echo chamber. One shooting inevitably leads to speculation about who will be targeted next.\n\n\"The streets remember,\" said Mark Denney, a state prosecutor who is trying to end Wilmington's retaliatory warfare.\n\nSocial media accelerates the threats, and the danger. Teenagers whose brains are years from fully maturing are roaming the streets with a gun in one pocket and a smartphone in the other.\n\n\"A juvenile with a gun is a heck of a lot more dangerous than a 24- or 25-year-old with a gun,\" said James Durham, the acting U.S. attorney based in Savannah.\n\nDuring a recent presentation, Chaz Mollins, coordinator of violence prevention programs for Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington, showed a group of teens a map of Wilmington studded with pushpins, each marking the location of a shooting: white for injuries, red for homicides.\n\nThe pins, clustered in a handful of high-poverty neighborhoods, showed the kind of pattern you might see in an outbreak of some infectious disease, like Zika or Ebola, Mollins said.\n\n\"So,\" he said, \"we are in the midst of an epidemic.\"\n\nThe problem facing Wilmington and these other cities: How to stop the spread?\n\nGANGS AT WAR\n\nFor Malik Walker, the best thing about turning 18 wasn't the birthday party he threw for himself at a local hotel. It's the fact that, as an adult, he can now legally buy a gun.\n\nMalik was just 12 when he dodged his first shootout on Wilmington's notorious west side. At 15, he was kneeling on a sidewalk, calling an ambulance as he pressed his shirt against his best friend's bloody chest. The friend had been shot 13 times on the corner where Malik had just been standing.\n\nThree years later, the tall, slender teenager with an easy smile still shudders at the thought that, had he not stopped into a store for a juice, he could have been lying there, too.\n\n\"I'm scared to even tie my shoe, because I don't know who might creep up behind me,\" Malik said as a police car's strobing red-and-blue lights illuminate the unfurnished room where he and several friends have gathered on a sticky, summer night. \"It makes me want to take these two eyes and make two more, and put them in the back of my head.\"\n\nFor teens in the First State's largest city, this is life.\n\nIn Wilmington, data from the Gun Violence Archive show that roughly 3 out of every 1,000 adolescents are injured or killed annually from gun violence. That is almost twice the rate reported from Chicago and just over 9 times the national average as reported for 2015 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe news organizations sought to measure teenage gun violence in America's cities because it is something the federal government does not track on a regular and comprehensive basis.\n\nAdded agony: Justice is haphazard after kids’ gun deaths\n\nChronicle of agony: Gun accidents kill at least 1 kid every other day\n\nNearly a quarter of Wilmington's residents live below the poverty line. Eighty-six percent of the city's youth receive some form of state assistance.\n\nSingle-parent families live packed together in old-style housing projects or dilapidated brick row houses. Already separated from the more prosperous parts of town, Wilmington's poorer and largely black neighborhoods are divided physically by Interstate 95, which bisects the city, and by cliques that carve those neighborhoods into rival sections: Hilltop and West Center City; \"The Hill\" and \"Down Bottom.\"\n\nAbout 30 active street crews exist in Wilmington today, estimated David Kennedy, a national expert in criminology who has for years studied the city's crime problem. Prosecutors say these crews, made up of roughly 20 people per group, are responsible for most of Wilmington's crime.\n\nA yearlong investigation by The News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, detailed a veritable war between two groups — Only My Brothers and Shoot to Kill. A News Journal analysis of court records, social media and the newspaper's internal database found that a third of the shooting victims under age 21 during the first seven months of 2016 had links to the rivalry.\n\nThe feud began in January 2015 with the death of 16-year-old Jordan Ellerbe, gunned down while listening to music with friends on a front porch in the city's Hilltop neighborhood. The same home was targeted again two days later, leaving three mourners wounded.\n\nThe war escalated in the months that followed. One gang member would shoot at a rival; weeks later, fire would be returned. In May 2016, 15-year-old Brandon Wingo was shot and killed on his way home from school.\n\nA month later, three alleged members of Shoot to Kill were charged with the popular basketball player's death. Between July and September of 2016, officials arrested 28 alleged OMB members on charges of gang participation, carrying concealed guns, robbery and attempted assault. An additional teen was later charged as part of OMB, bringing the total to 29.\n\nWilmington's new police chief, Robert Tracy, says the city needs to do more of this — identifying those committing crimes and getting them off the street. It's a strategy employed in other cities.\n\n\"There's a small percentage of individuals that are going back and forth causing this violence in the city,\" Tracy, Chicago's former top crime strategist, said earlier this year during a vigil for a 6-year-old boy who had been shot. \"And all the good people are tired of it, and they're outraged.\"\n\n'YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DUCK'\n\nUnlike larger, more organized criminal enterprises such as the Crips, the Bloods or the Mexican Mafia, feuds among teenage gangs in Wilmington don't revolve around drugs, or territory, or even money. It's about respect.\n\nIn the internet age, bad blood can spring up and spread instantly online with the double tap of a thumb on a smartphone screen or a hastily tapped-out Tweet. Teenagers in Wilmington don't sport gang colors or uniforms, but identify themselves with emojis and hashtags.\n\n\"Technology's evolution has made it easier for criminals to get guns,\" said Deputy Attorney General Joseph Grubb. \"It also has made it easier for young people to get offended by something, causing them to go grab a gun and shoot up a block as opposed to, 'Meet me in the school yard and let's fist fight.'\"\n\nAnd every shooting opens up the possibility for another, as the thirst for retaliation creates a bloody game of back-and-forth: a life for a life for a life. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research, young men under the age of 34 who have been shot in Wilmington are 11 times more likely to commit gun violence in their lifetimes.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki said some of the blame can be laid on a \"fractured education system\" that sends children on buses to schools in rival neighborhoods. Many fathers are either in prison or have past convictions that make it difficult for them to find good jobs.\n\nAll of this leads to hopelessness and powerlessness, said the Rev. Derrick Johnson of the Joshua Harvest Church. \"Pastor D,\" as he's known on the streets, understands that feeling, because he too has been there. Johnson was a 17-year-old drug dealer when he fatally shot a man. Thanks to a rehabilitative program, he was pardoned after serving 15 years.\n\nAt 59, Johnson's ministry is as much in the streets as it is in the pulpit.\n\nOne afternoon, Johnson strolled down the stairs of the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center in the city's troubled West Center City neighborhood. A group of little girls, licking Popsicles, stood on the landing, leaning against the railing and peering down at the pastor. He reached into his pocket and handed each child a dollar bill.\n\n\"What you be doing when they be shooting around here?\" he asked the children.\n\n\"Running home,\" said a girl with pigtails.\n\n\"You run?\" the minister said, \"you're supposed to duck.\"\n\n\"I learned that in school,\" another girl shouts. \"I duck my head, somewhere where they won't find me.\"\n\nAN EPIDEMIC OF SHOOTINGS\n\nOn Nov. 3, 2015, Rayquan Briscoe was walking down Maryland Avenue for an appointment with his probation officer on a drug conviction. He heard gunshots. Briscoe tried to run, but his legs failed him: He'd been struck in the back, just to the right of his spinal column. He was paralyzed from the waist down. He was 17 years old.\n\n\"Bullets don't have no names,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Briscoe said he's never carried a gun himself, guns have had an outsized impact on his young life.\n\nLast year, Briscoe's father was shot to death. Rayquan's younger brother, Raymire, was just 14 when he was charged with murder in the May 2014 killing of a 29-year-old man; he pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nDespite all that, Briscoe said there are legitimate reasons for teens in Wilmington to arm themselves.\n\n\"Somebody after you with a gun, your only other option is to pick up a gun,\" he said. \"If somebody, for instance, has a brother and they know that their brother's been shot or killed from a gun, then that's a legitimate reason for them to want to do something to somebody else, or carry a gun,\" he said. \"That might be their only way of feeling better or dealing with life after that.\"\n\nUnless and until guns are outlawed, Briscoe said, he doesn't see anything changing.\n\n\"It's the world,\" he said. \"As long as killings keep going on, it's gonna be more killings. As long as more guns made, it's gonna be more guns.\"\n\nWilmington officials have desperately cast about for solutions — without success, at least so far.\n\nIn December 2013, City Council President Hanifa Shabazz asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate. It would be the agency's first-ever inquiry into gun violence as a public health epidemic. The agency found that, between 2009 and 2014, 15% of the people arrested in Wilmington for a firearms crime were under the age of 18.\n\nThe CDC recommended that agencies share information such as school truancy records, child welfare reports and emergency room visits to identify youth who need help earlier in life to avoid violence later. But after closing a $400 million budget gap through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts, Gov. John Carney said the state doesn't have the money to execute the CDC's plan.\n\nA CDC advisory council proposed linking four city schools with community health and social services in New Castle County. In May, the mayor announced a neighborhood stabilization program he hopes will revitalize the city's roughest neighborhoods by beefing up the police presence, cracking down on liquor stores and increasing trash pickup.\n\nThe community, meanwhile, is pressing forward on its own.\n\nDerrick Reed, owner of His Image Barber Lounge near Wilmington's Little Italy, began holding sessions for teens at his shop on Monday evenings. He calls the program Born for Brothers.\n\n\"We're actively talking to these young guys when they get in the chair,\" said Joel Payne, one of the barbers. \"We teach them about respect. We're teaching about morals. We teach them about values. We teach them about success.\"\n\nPayne, now 31 and a father, speaks from personal experience: \"I used to live that life.\"\n\nHe was just 12 when he stole his first gun — a chrome-plated, pearl-handled .380-caliber semi-automatic. At 16, he pistol-whipped a man during a home invasion. By 17, he'd graduated to shooter: He shot another boy in the leg during a robbery.\n\nPayne was 11 when his father got back from a prison stint for drugs. His mother was working all the time to support him and his seven siblings. Missing meals, wearing his sisters' hand-me-down sneakers, watching the drug dealers flash their jewelry and cars. It all added up.\n\n\"When you grow up with a reality of rejection, and feeling alone, and nobody there to really like talk to and express your feelings, you look for other ways to express yourself,\" he said.\n\nLatisha Jackson, too, speaks from personal experience. She organized 302 MAFIA (302 is Wilmington's area code; MAFIA stands for Mothers and Fathers In Action) to create a support system for those returning home from prison. But Jackson said it is also meant to awaken parents like her, who were \"walking blind\" while their children drifted toward violence.\n\nWith their father away in prison, Jackson worked two full-time jobs to provide for her boys, Jahlil and Na-Quan Lewis. She took them on vacations, got them involved in football and basketball. She forbade violent video games, never allowed so much as a squirt or BB gun in the home.\n\nTo no avail.\n\nJahlil was just 16 when he grabbed a pistol and set out with other OMB members to the house of a rival gang member. Police got wind of their plan, and Jahlil and three others were arrested en route to their intended target.\n\nInvestigators later found images of Jahlil and Na-Quan brandishing guns on social media and in cellphone pictures.\n\nEarlier this year, Jahlil pleaded guilty to felony charges of gang participation, possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile, carrying a concealed deadly weapon and second-degree conspiracy for planning criminal acts with gang members. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Na-Quan, now 20, pleaded guilty in July to possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and a probation violation on a 2014 robbery conviction. He was sentenced to three years, plus four years and 11 months for breaking probation.\n\nEach time Jackson visits Jahlil, the routine is the same.\n\n\"I hold his hands and tell him how cold his fingers are,\" she said. \"And then I look at him and say, 'I just cannot believe that my baby is in adult penitentiary.'\"\n\n'SHOULD HE BE NEXT?'\n\nWilliam Rollins and Maria Williams believe the attack on their home can be traced back to the death of Lil Bill, in January 2015. In its aftermath, Rollins had received chilling text messages with photographs of his youngest son, just 11 at the time. \"Should he be next?\" the sender asked. Other threats in texts and on social media followed.\n\nOn July 21, John Brisco, aka \"Bin Laden,\" was given two life sentences in Lil Bill's murder. So notorious is the Touch Money Crew gangster in the Hilltop neighborhood that \"Osama City\" was scrawled in Sharpie on the wall of a liquor store. \"Love you, Osama,\" said another tag; and another, #LongliveOsama.\n\nOn July 26, the Rollins' home came under fire.\n\nAfter the children were released from the hospital, the family left Wilmington. On a recent afternoon, 16-year-old Keshon and 18-year-old Kieshonna sat on a picnic bench beneath a shade tree. Kieshonna unwrapped the bandage from her knee to reveal an angry inch-wide gash just below her kneecap; Keshon's wounds had scabbed over.\n\nThe teenagers want to return to Wilmington, but their parents will have none of that world.\n\n\"The craziest thing about it is, these kids are accepting it,\" William Rollins said. \"Like, they're accepting going to jail for life. They're accepting getting put in the grave. But they don't realize the effect that they do to everybody else around them.\"\n\nTo his wife, gun violence among teenagers has simply become part of everyday life in Wilmington: \"Somebody taking somebody's child's life, over nothing.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Allen G.

School referendums splinter communities", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nVoters are set to consider three referendums statewide that would would raise almost $500 million.\n\nSchool district officials say they're forced to ask for money because of the state's complex funding system.\n\nThe regular referendums have sparked tension among voters who are asked to fund education.\n\nSpring is the time of year when education turns into politics, when school districts give residents a choice: Vote to raise property taxes or face teacher and program cuts.\n\nNobody — not seniors, not parents, not even school officials who say the money is desperately needed — like asking for a tax hike.\n\nSchool supporters and parents bemoan the fact that educators and parents are forced to campaign for referendums, rather than focus on teaching children.\n\nWhat's frequently misunderstood by citizens is that referendums are often intended only to keep the status quo, supporters say. But Delaware's complex school funding system has made it difficult to convince voters the increases are necessary to cover growing student enrollment and maintenance costs.\n\n\"There's so much time and energy that has to be poured into it, it's just hundreds and hundreds of man hours,\" said Eve Buckley, a Christina School District parent who is one of the volunteer leaders in an effort to pass that district's referendum on Wednesday. \"And it's time you're using just in hopes of staying where we are, maybe getting a little better, not providing some big new idea. The process is a real drain.\"\n\nBrandywine and Cape Henlopen also are seeking voters' approval that day. The three referendums combined would raise almost $500 million.\n\nThe success of those votes comes down to whether district officials can coax enough parents with children in public schools to go to the polls. They must outnumber those who don't feel they have a stake in the schools or who feel districts should do more to prove they deserve a tax increase.\n\n\"If I go to my boss and haven't done what I'm supposed to ... I don't ask for a raise,\" said Susan Welsh, who wants to see Christina begin to improve student test scores and find efficiencies before she votes in favor. \"I love my child enough to vote 'no' and hold them [the district] accountable to raising the ranking before I give them a raise.\"\n\nDistrict supporters say referendums aren't a luxury. They are a necessity.\n\nMoney that pays for schools is a mix of state, federal and local funds. While the state's portion grows as districts enroll more students, the local portion comes from property taxes that don't increase to match growing costs.\n\nIf districts don't get the money to cover those costs, the results can be demoralizing, Buckley says.\n\n\"You want to think you're part of a community that is at least reasonably supportive of public education, and then something like what happened last year takes place,\" she said. \"And then you start to worry about this negative feedback loop, where people think the district isn't worthy, so then we have to cut budgets. And that means the schools suffer, and the perception only gets reinforced.\"\n\nActing Christina Superintendent Bob Andrzejewski says its dangerous to leave districts without a steady, reliable base of funding.\n\n\"There are no reruns when it comes to education,\" he said. \"If a student misses out on important educational services because there's no money, you can't go back and make that up later.\"\n\nChristina is seeking about $16 million, which would amount to roughly $192 a year more in taxes for the average homeowner, according to the district. That money would be used to plug some of the holes left after the district slashed $9 million from its budget last year and would also add some new programs.\n\nBrandywine is asking taxpayers for money to cover operating expenses, for work on school buildings and to put synthetic turf on its athletic fields. It estimates that an average home-owner would pay an extra $243 per year for the next three years and $206 per year after the $1.7 million turf project will be done. The district needs $19.3 million for the building projects and $9.5 million for operating expenses.\n\nThe referendum in Cape Henlopen is a little different – it is asking voters for money that would be used strictly for building two elementary schools and doing work on two others, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999. The total cost for the project is $154.5 million, but local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder $48.4 million of it.\n\nSwaying the public\n\nThe base of the bloc that typically votes against referendums is believed to be older residents who don't have children, don't directly benefit from the tax increases and are often on fixed incomes.\n\nOlder residents vote more than younger residents. And low-income families are less likely to vote than more affluent families, who may not send their children to traditional public schools, Buckley said.\n\nThat stacks referendums against the districts.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge, no question,\" Buckley said.\n\nIn Christina's first referendum last year, when voters slapped down a tax increase by an almost three-to-one margin, turnout in more affluent suburban areas dwarfed turnout in poorer urban areas.\n\nSTORY: Robocalls used in Christina schools referendum\n\nSTORY: Wilmington redistricting plan advances on shaky ground\n\n\n\nIn five polling places in Wilmington, there were a total of 258 votes. At a single suburban polling place – McVey Elementary, just off the University of Delaware campus – more than 556 people voted.\n\nThe vote failed 2,119 – 6,076.\n\nWhen Christina took a second shot with a smaller referendum last year, the district made more energetic efforts to get the word out to voters, and turnout evened out somewhat. The referendum failed again, but this time by less than 900 votes out of more than 11,000.\n\n\"The support's there,\" said Brian Stephan, a parent with two children in Christina and co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee. \"It's just tapping into it and letting them know where to be and what you're voting for.\"\n\nPart of the problem, supporters say, is that the state's school finance system is so complicated.\n\nStephan points out that school referendums are the only time residents get to choose whether to tax themselves. For other taxes, elected representatives choose when to raise rates; citizens vote those representatives out if they don't like their choices.\n\n\"It's the one chance that people get, so they tend to vent some of their frustrations,\" he said. \"It doesn't just become about school taxes, it's all taxes. And that makes it hard for us.\"\n\nReferendum opponents do frequently bring up other tax proposals.\n\n\"The governor wants to put more money in for the gas tax, he wants to give more money to the casinos,\" said Marie Lulfs, a 76-year-old Christina resident. \"Everybody wants more money, and where are they getting it from? The taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nNobody knows the impacts of a failed referendum quite like Christina parents and teachers.\n\nAfter voters twice rejected tax increases last year, the district made more than $9 million in cuts, laying off 78 teachers and 14 aides.\n\nStephan's daughter's first-grade class has 37 students, far more than last year.\n\n\"That has been an extreme challenge for her teacher and for her,\" Stephan said. \"You can just tell when she comes home from school.\"\n\nSupporters like Stephan say it is hard to make voters understand that operating referendums don't necessarily mean a district is seeking new goodies. In some cases, like Christina's, they are simply asking for enough money to preserve the level of services.\n\nAbout 55 percent of Christina's budget comes from state funding, while 38 percent comes from local property taxes (the rest comes from federal sources).\n\nThe state's share of school taxes grows as the district adds students, but the property tax revenue doesn't always do so.\n\nUnlike many states, school taxes don't automatically adjust for inflation. So when costs of things like fuel and electricity go up, the money a district gets from property taxes buys less and less.\n\nIf more of the budget goes toward overhead, there is less available for educational programs.\n\nThat argument hasn't convinced some referendum opponents.\n\n\"They got $20 million five years ago – it didn't do anything,\" said Welsh. \"So what's this $16 million going to do? There's no proof in the pudding.\"\n\nA better system?\n\nMichael Griffith, who studies school finance issues at the Colorado-based Education Commission of the States, said local school funding mechanisms vary widely from state to state. When it comes to picking the best method, he said figuring out \"the one true religion is probably easier than this.\"\n\nMost states require voter approval for school tax increases, he said. But many allow districts the choice to occasionally raise taxes by a small amount, usually tied to an inflation rate, without going to voters.\n\n\"If you believe in public education, as we do, the quality of our childrens' educational experience should not depend on a vote,\" Andrzejewski said. \"There are very few states left in the country that require referendums for operating expenses.\"\n\nAndrzejewski, who was previously Red Clay superintendent and has worked on several referendums, argues the state should move to a similar system. Delaware's vo-tech school districts, he points out, are given the ability to raise taxes up to a certain cap before getting the General Assembly's approval.\n\n\"There is a politically accepted, viable model that Delaware already has,\" Andrzejewski said. \"School board members are elected officials just as the General Assembly is. They should be trusted to make a prudent financial decision on behalf of the community.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, Andrzejewski said a system like this would allow districts to raise taxes gradually over time, instead of periodically hitting them with one big increase all at once. Inflation rates are typically under two percent; by contrast, Christina is looking for a 21 percent increase in its tax rate.\n\nThere are two big caveats, Andrzejewski says.\n\nFirst, school board members should be required to get financial training and should be penalized if they don't.\n\nAnd second, districts should still be required to go to referendum for major new programs or building campaigns.\n\nAre schools 'electioneering?\n\nAnother problem is Delaware districts are sometimes accused of employing underhanded tactics to get the votes they need.\n\nThe same day Christina's first referendum failed in 2015, Red Clay passed one. Almost immediately, some residents cried foul.\n\nMany Red Clay schools held parent engagement events on the night of the vote in their buildings, which serve as polling places. Several older voters said those events crowded parking lots, denying them parking spaces that were close enough for them to make it in to vote. It also boosted turnout among parents.\n\nAn ACLU of Delaware lawsuit over those claims is still making its way through the courts. Red Clay maintains that it took sufficient steps to provide enough parking and argued it frequently holds events at schools to keep parents engaged in their kids' education.\n\nSTORY: Christina School District takes third try at referendum\n\nSTORY: UD to make SAT optional\n\nState Sen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, received numerous complaints from constituents.\n\n\"Last year's Red Clay district referendum was the poster child for what's wrong with the whole system,\" Peterson said. \"There was so much electioneering that went on inside the polling places that it was just an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nPeterson says this isn't the first time a district has been accused of electioneering, referencing a so-called \"Pizza-gate\" incident a few years ago in which Smyrna schools threw pizza parties at schools on referendum night.\n\n\"I couldn't stand inside a polling place and hand out pizza if you voted for me,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson has proposed a bill that would change how districts go out to referendums.\n\nFirst, schools could only seek one referendum a year, at the same time as school board elections. That would save the state Department of Elections money and force districts to make one pitch for what they really need.\n\nThe fact that districts often come right back with referendum requests if a previous one fails upsets many opponents.\n\n\"If you say 'no' once, I mean 'no,\" Lulfs said. \"You don't have to keep shoving it down my throat.\"\n\nPeterson's bill would also have referendums conducted via mail. That would make more voters aware of the issues, she said, and prevent the inherent problems in having polling places that directly benefit from the results of a vote.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about all this going on at the schools,\" she said.\n\nWhile Peterson argues these changes would make the system fairer, she agrees with some school supporters who say broader change is a good idea.\n\n\"These districts can get in a really bad place, because this is money they really do need,\" she said. \"But you're asking people to vote for a tax on themselves. Something has to change.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

All three of those proposals – for a tax increase to support the regular operating budget, for funding to cover the cost of the building project and for money to install synthetic turf fields – were bundled together in a single vote that was rejected by a very slim margin in March. The district decided last month to present the same plan again, without the synthetic turf project.\n\nDistricts can go out for a referendum twice in a one-year span, according to Anthony Albence, director of the New Castle County Office of the Board of Elections. Last year, the Christina School District was in a situation similar to the one Brandywine is in now – its first bid for an increase in taxes to support its operating budget failed, so it went out for a second one. That one failed, too. But, this past March, Christina got its 21-percent tax increase passed.\n\nBrandywine has a $174 million budget for the next school year, but will have to slash $8 million if the referendum doesn't pass, according to Superintendent Mark Holodick.\n\nThose cuts would include teachers, which would increase the class size for students; guidance counselors; reading specialists; and support staff, according to a voting guide sent to district residents in advance of the May 17 referendum.\n\nThe district hasn't given specific numbers for precisely what positions would be cut, but an $8 million cut would likely mean that between 35 and 50 teachers would be cut, which is a 6 to 8 percent decrease in the teaching force. After Christina's second referendum failed last year, that district chopped $9 million out of its budget and fired 78 teachers and 14 aides. All of those positions are now set to be restored since the referendum passed in March.\n\nAll clubs, activities and sports would face cutbacks, except for high school varsity teams, if the Brandywine referendum doesn't pass, according to the voting guide.\n\nThe district is looking for an additional 28 cents per $100 of assessed property value – it currently collects $1.09 per $100 of assessed property value and it last went out to voters with a referendum in 2012.\n\nAt that point, it had planned on getting through three years before putting up another referendum, Holodick said. That last referendum's increase ended up lasting for four years, though.\n\nEach year the expenses for employees and the day-to-day bills for the district increase, so the tax increase that the district is seeking would maintain the current programming, according to the voting guide.\n\nThe building project that is on the ballot would cover work on three school buildings and the demolition of a school that has been empty since 2010. It would cost local property owners just over $19 million, but it wouldn't actually increase the taxes they've been paying because it would pick up where a large capital project, passed in 2005, left off. That was a $63 million project that renovated two schools, built three new ones, demolished one, relocated the district office and purchased a transportation facility.\n\nThe referendum's failure to pass in March prompted a group of students from the district's three high schools to put together a campaign in support of its passage on Tuesday – they finished their campaign with a gathering that included area politicians on the steps of Brandywine High School on Sunday.\n\nSome district residents, though, have been critical of the value of the referendum, including one parent who posted a YouTube video detailing his opposition.\n\nContact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909, sspencer@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @SSpencerTNJ.\n\nTO VOTE\n\nPolls will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday at 22 locations across the district.

Since the state's property tax levy cap went into effect in 2012, East Ramapo has had by far the most budget defeats among New York's nearly 700 school districts.\n\nAnd Edgemont voters narrowly rejected a $66.8 million capital improvements bond.\n\nMore:6 key takeaways from school elections -- from budget defeats to a school board race's tie\n\nVoters decided on school district budgets, propositions and school board races during a budget season that had districts facing inflation, limited increases in state \"foundation aid\" and waning pandemic relief money.\n\nUnofficial results are listed below for school districts in Putnam, Rockland and Westchester counties.\n\nChappaqua and East Ramapo can put forth a second proposal, with or without changes, on June 18. Districts that lose two budget votes must adopt a state-imposed contingency budget, which would freeze the tax levy at this year's amount.\n\nThirteen districts proposed tax levy increases below 2%, the cap the state starts with for 2024-25. Each district's final cap ends up being higher or lower depending on a number of factors. Thirty-two districts proposed increases between 2% and 4%. Seven districts proposed increases between 4% and 5%.\n\nThe highest proposed tax-levy increase, in percentage terms, was Rye's 6.55%. Rye was one of four districts across the three counties proposing to break their tax caps, along with Chappaqua, Harrison and Scarsdale.\n\nRye, Harrison and Scarsdale got more than 60% approval from voters, required to pass a budget that breaks their tax cap.\n\nChappaqua's budget plan, though, got slammed by voters, not even coming close to a simple majority. Voters defeated the spending plan 2,006-1,128.\n\nThree districts didn't propose any increase to their tax levies: Carmel, Mount Vernon and North Rockland.\n\nWith a history of rejecting budget plans that hike the tax levy even by a fraction, East Ramapo’s voters this year rejected a budget that would have increased the tax levy by 1.99%, the same percent increase that voters narrowly rejected last year. This year's $331.9 million budget plan would have tapped nearly $20 million from reserves. Affidavit ballots still had to be counted. There was no word Tuesday night if a re-vote would be considered.\n\nEast Ramapo, facing a fiscal cliff, is asking the state to give it a \"spin up,\" basically a way to tap future aid early. With local support lagging, it makes the move more unlikely.\n\nThe average proposed spending increase in 53 districts across Putnam, Westchester and Rockland was a little over 4%.\n\nLast year, Blind Brook and East Ramapo saw their first spending plans rejected before voters approved their second proposals. East Ramapo voters subsequently passed a budget with no increase in the tax levy.

Where does it start?\n\nState approves school funding requests for building projects, Red Clay eyes referendum\n\nDelaware Department of Education approved several requests for state funding next fiscal year. The department green-lit 50 certificate of necessity requests last month, while 44 involved state funding.\n\nSchool districts submit such requests every year, hoping for capital project or deferred maintenance assistance from the state. The state decides whether to approve, kicking in state funds that must come alongside a certain amount of local monies.\n\nFrom new Appoquinimink elementary, middle and high schools, to a new Charles W. Bush Early Education Center in Brandywine or renovations to over 20 Red Clay schools — which project funding districts hoped to secure can be explored online. Some expected totals are below, in state funds, concentrated in six districts:\n\nAppoquinimink: $223,177,971\n\nRed Clay Consolidated: $192,309,981\n\nColonial: $73,449,859\n\nBrandywine: $60,400,000\n\nChristina: $5,503,609\n\nPolytech: $2,953,097\n\nRed Clay must hold a referendum to meet local funding requirements, to pave the way to some $289 million in funding for its projects. If passed, Red Clay district residents would see a net increase of $0.50 per $100 of assessed value, over three years.\n\nIf it fails, Red Clay can try again a few months later. If the referendum fails again, state funds will be withdrawn. Community information meetings are expected, as the last ask like this was back in 2015.\n\nThe referendum is set for Feb. 28, 2024.\n\nKeeping pace:Appoquinimink, Brandywine ask for tax increases in coming referendum votes\n\nDelaware's HBCU continues to grow\n\nDelaware State University just released its fall enrollment figures by late November — continuing to break records at 132 years old.\n\nThe Dover institution now has 6,451 students, an increase of 3.5% over last year and 23% since 2020. That makes it one of the fastest-growing Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country.\n\nAccording to Delaware State's press release, President Tony Allen is \"cautiously optimistic\" toward the growth.\n\n\"As we have seen impressive growth in our enrollment since 2017, we have also seen the national trend going in the other direction,\" he said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the falling rates of college attendance nationwide and the steady declines in high school graduates due to lower birth rates in the U.S.\"\n\nDSU also saw growth in its graduate profile, up 7% to nearly 900 students; a 5% increase in new transfer students, up to just over 300 students; and a boost in online scholars at nearly 800 students.

John Carney and vow a fight in the General Assembly to stop them.\n\n\"At some point in time, we have to look at our future and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Jeff Day, who is running for a spot on the Christina school board and has children in the Appoquinimink district.\n\nCarney has said he would rather not be making any cuts but said \"shared sacrifice\" is necessary in the face of the state's nearly $400 million budget deficit.\n\n\"These are extremely modest cuts in the scheme of things, and other cabinet agencies are being cut a lot more,\" Carney said. \"All we're asking is that our school boards do a little more to run a little more efficiently.\"\n\nSTORY: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nSTORY: Fear spreads through Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nThe cuts are only 1.5 percent of the state's $1.37 billion public school budget, the governor noted.\n\nAbout $15 million of the cuts will come straight from school districts' operational funds, money that generally isn't used to pay teachers but covers training, technology and other administrative costs.\n\nAn additional $22 million will come from something called the \"education sustainment fund,\" which is used for a much wider range of services like math and reading specialists, after-school programming and paying staff salaries over the summer, before tax receipts come in.\n\nCarney's plan would allow districts to make up the $22 million cut by giving school districts a one-time shot at raising property taxes – without asking their voters in a referendum. It would need the approval of the General Assembly.\n\nThat would leave only a $15 million cut spread over the entire system, the governor reasons.\n\nBut school board members say the decision to raise that so-called \"match tax\" would put them in the painful position of losing money or outraging taxpayers at a time when many school boards already are struggling to pass referendums.\n\nSchool board members also say the property tax increases would unfairly burden taxpayers in property-poor districts.\n\n“It’s foolish, I think, and a fool’s errand when the state is facing a big deficit like it is, to argue the state shouldn't cut education,\" Appoquinimink school board President Richard Forsten said. “Times are tough and everyone needs to tighten their belts … but if we’re going to do it, it needs to be fair.”\n\nA tight timeline\n\nThe General Assembly has until June 30 to debate the state budget, and school districts have only until July 13 to get tax warrants to their local counties, giving them little time to ponder a final decision on the match tax.\n\nThe dilemma for superintendents and principals is that state law mandates any teacher laid off must be notified no later than May 15.\n\nSTORY: Carney proposes tax hikes, spending cuts in state budget\n\nSTORY: Delaware's budget hole deepens by $35.6 million\n\nDistricts will need to plan for cuts they aren't even sure are coming. That means they might be sending pink slips to employees they might not need to fire.\n\nConversely, the cuts may deepen and they may have dip into their reserves or get rid of school programs.\n\nRep. Melanie George Smith, D-Bear and chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, acknowledges the timing is tough for districts. But she said it's too early in the General Assembly to give a final ruling.\n\nLawmakers still have to settle the thorny question of how much to cut and how much to raise revenue. Carney has proposed an equal balance of tax increases and spending cuts, but lawmakers don't have to follow that rule.\n\nWhile there's little appetite among lawmakers to balance the budget with nearly $400 million in tax increases — thus avoiding cuts entirely — they could lean a little heavier on taxes than Carney did. They could expand Carney's proposed increases to the income tax, corporate franchise tax and tobacco tax. Or they could impose other hikes, like expanding the lodging tax or adding to the alcohol tax.\n\nThat could mean the proposed cuts to education would vanish or diminish.\n\nThis revenue issue is perhaps the biggest question looming over the current General Assembly. And Smith said her committee won't know how to handle education cuts until that question is answered.\n\n\"We on JFC can't say what we're going to do until our 62 colleagues decide what kind of revenue we have to work with,\" Smith said.\n\nShe said it's also possible her committee will find other, less painful places to cut education spending.\n\n\"The question isn't how much we're cutting; the question is what we're cutting,\" she said. \"We can find places to cut spending that don't affect direct instruction.\"\n\nBut \"there really are no easy answers here,\" George cautioned.\n\nIf state government were to avoid education cuts, it would have to make deeply painful cuts elsewhere. Education makes up about one-third of the budget.\n\nThe only other part of government that is anywhere near that size is health and social services, on which the state spends about $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues below graph.\n\nSchools have been taking up a greater share of the state budget each year because state officials are required by law to increase funding as the number of students in public schools grows. As a result, the number of education employees in Delaware has grown significantly even as the number of other government workers has declined.\n\nSTORY: Gov. John Carney: Fix budget, update Coastal Zone Act\n\nIn 2009, there were 16,877 school district employees — as of this February, that number had grown to 19,422. During the same period, the number of other state government employees shrank from 14,103 to 13,338.\n\nWhile Carney has insisted he does not intend for schools to cut staff, salaries are the biggest part of every district's budget. Which has several of them looking at layoffs.\n\nTo tax or not to tax?\n\nThe cuts are worse if school boards don't impose the referendum-less \"match tax.\"\n\nFor instance, Christina School District is estimating total losses of about $5.86 million — $3.9 million of which it could potentially recover via the match tax.\n\nThat means raising taxes 7.3 cents per $100 of assessed property value. For example, a home in Windy Hills, Newark, recently sold for $224,000 has an assessed property value of $63,700 and would face a potential annual property tax increase of $46.50, according to district records.\n\nIn comparison, Christina’s last referendum, held in 2016, raised taxes by 30 cents, an increase of about $191 per year on a similarly valued home.\n\nEven if the district ultimately decides to raise taxes without voter approval, it still would have to make about $2 million in cuts, according to Christina Financial Manager Bob Silber. Due to timing considerations, it's also making plans for the full $5.9 million.\n\nCausalities could include the district's Montessori Program, which has an enrollment of about 60 students and was recently re-committed to by the school board. Another option is to discontinue elementary instrumental music and elementary and secondary string music classes.\n\nThe cuts seem large, but for some school districts, reductions are compounded by the fact they already planned on making large ones next year.\n\nTake Indian River, which days before Carney released his budget had outlined $1.72 million in reductions.\n\nThough it recently passed a $7.35 million referendum, the district has been struggling financially and planned on reducing the amount of paid coaching staff for athletics and some salary reductions, including eliminating non-athletic extra pay for extra responsibilities.\n\nThe plan was to streamline programs, not eliminate them. But now, with Indian River facing a total of about $3.4 million in cuts, the scope of that original budget reduction plan could change. Passing the “match tax” would raise taxes about 12.5 cents per $100 of assessed property value, Superintendent Mark Steele told residents during a recent \"town hall\" held on Facebook Live.\n\nSTORY: Colonial takes another shot at referendum, warns of cuts\n\nSTORY: Indian River School District faces $3.4M in cuts\n\nFor Colonial, which is holding a referendum June 6, there's even more on the line.\n\nThe district's last referendum, in February, was voted down, which means the district was already considering cuts.\n\nShould the June referendum also be defeated, Colonial is preparing to implement over $4 million in reductions for the 2017-2018 school year, including 120 layoffs. The budget cuts add roughly another 50 layoffs, bring the total to 170.\n\nThose estimates are based on the total cuts the district could see in the budget — about $3 million — and does not include the match tax.\n\n\"The idea of the referendum is really to make us whole,\" Colonial Superintendent Dusty Blakey said. \"To keep us at our operating level currently.\"\n\nShared sacrifice\n\nOther school districts, like Appoquinimink, are approaching the education cuts a little differently. The district is considering reducing transportation costs, reducing its budget for substitute custodians and eliminating up to 17 teachers, among other things.\n\nForsten, the school board's president, seems to realize cuts, if not inevitable, are likely. He's trying to prepare for them.\n\nHe and the district's financial director, Charles Longfellow, are working to ensure that even if the district has to raise taxes, it's doing so in a way that's fair to local residents.\n\nBecause the way Carney has proposed doing it, that's not fair, Forsten said.\n\nHe said because the cuts aren't based on districts' property tax bases, some Delaware homeowners will have to pay only a little bit more in taxes each year, while homeowners in districts like Appoquinimink would shell out a pretty significant chunk of change.\n\nForsten used Brandywine, which like Appoquinimink is facing about $3 million in total cuts, as a comparison.\n\nIf Brandywine and Appoquinimink both had to cover the total $3 million, he said, the taxes in Appoquinimink would be higher.\n\nIn Brandywine, a home valued at $63,700 would face annual property tax increase of about $56. In Appoquinimink, where rates needed to be raised more because there's less taxable property, taxes will go up by about $95.\n\nForsten thinks the formula for calculating the cuts needs to be changed, so residents all pay roughly the same.\n\nAt a board workshop Wednesday night, not all agreed.\n\nChristina's Day says instead of suggesting changes to how the cuts are made, school boards throughout the state should be rallying against any cuts at all.\n\n\"Don't roll over, acquiesce and say, 'Yes, Dover, if you give us the authority to match tax, we'll use it,'\" Day said. \"Otherwise, they'll just keep doing this.\"\n\nHe also thinks resources given to school districts should be the same across the state, and that Appoquinimink should be fighting to eliminate the cuts altogether instead of looking out for its \"best interests\" and making sure it doesn't have to pay significantly more in taxes than Brandywine or Christina.\n\n\"I think we should be fighting so that all kids in the state are not hurt by this budget,\" Day said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Since its inception more than 20 years ago, Howard Street students have been taught in the South Salem High School annex.\n\nBut two years ago, Howard Street officials were told they would need to vacate the building by the start of the 2019-20 school year to allow South Salem to reach the district's desired enrollment capacity of 2,200 students.\n\nJust months before they were told to move, the Salem-Keizer School Board voted to cut about $185,000 from its funding for the charter school — about 15 percent — in order to fund it at the same level as the other charters in the district.\n\nThough Howard Street had time to find a new building and raise money, they still ran into a few hurdles along the way, including a shortage of about $200,000 to complete the move.\n\nAt the Salem-Keizer board meeting on Feb. 12, the board approved an amendment to its charter agreement with Howard Street, allowing the school to enroll more students through the school's lottery system and, as a result, raise more money to finish renovating and moving into its new location.\n\nThis change should help alleviate some of the financial strain, while slightly helping reduce some overcrowding in Salem-Keizer schools.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Christy Perry also has extended Howard Street's stay in the annex through the end of the calendar year.\n\nSchool officials want the public to know they are still open for business, especially as the deadline for 2019-20 lottery submissions approaches.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Howard Street moving forward:\n\nHoward St. does not plan on closing\n\nEven if they have to teach out of tents in Bush's Pasture Park, officials from Howard Street said they will always provide a quality education to all students enrolled.\n\nThat said, they have no intent of reaching that point or having to close.\n\nThe public charter school accepts students from across the Salem-Keizer school district, currently enrolling 180 students and receiving funding on a per student basis from the Oregon Department of Education.\n\nWith the passage of the amendment earlier this month, Howard Street is allowed to increase its enrollment from 180 students to a maximum of 200 students. They plan to increase enrollment to 192 students for 2019-20 and the foreseeable future. They aren't hitting the max in an attempt to maintain smaller class sizes.\n\nPrincipal Christina Tracy said the school has 30 students in each class. The amendment change will increases class sizes to 31 or 32 students.\n\nSince the charter receives money based on enrollment, Tracy said the change will bring in an additional $80,000 per year.\n\nTracy said they hope to move into the new space next January.\n\nSalem-Keizer: School Board OKs boundary changes 5-2, alters Howard Street agreement\n\nThey need more money for move\n\nLast year, Howard Street officials set their sights on the First Christian Church's extension building downtown, 625 Marion St NE, near Cinebarre Movieland 7.\n\nThe downtown location is more centralized and accessible, Principal Tracy said, adding that it's only a few blocks from the downtown bus station.\n\nOriginal estimates for the 20,000 square foot building came in at $1 million, in addition to the $50,000 per year cost for the land lease.\n\nTracy told the Statesman Journal last May the building would be purchased using school savings, a loan from Pioneer Trust Bank and money they have fundraised for upgrades and construction.\n\nThe school also planned to acquire the parking lot and use the money from the spaces to pay the lease, she said. As of Thursday, 90 percent of the parking spaces have been rented out.\n\nHowever, Howard Street still needs another $200,000 to complete the renovations and move. And as a charter school, they don't have the option to propose a funding measure to public vote.\n\nThe $80,000 per year additional revenue from the state will help, but Tracy said they will need to make a number of additional changes, starting with cutting construction costs where possible.\n\nSchool officials are looking at ways to reduce internal costs, such as possibly raising the price of their lunch program by a quarter and having students bring a ream of paper as part of their school supplies.\n\nThey also plan to decrease the number of field trips down to the ones really needed for the curriculum.\n\nAnd Tracy said they will need to amp up their fundraising. While they have done some fundraising throughout the school's history, Tracy, a founding teacher of the school, said, \"We're gonna have to be consistent.\"\n\nTracy said there are no changes to staffing at this time.\n\nBackground: Why Salem-Keizer board denied additional funding for Howard Street Charter School\n\nBigger classes, same offerings\n\nHoward Street is unique in its curriculum.\n\nStudents are required to take art, drama, Spanish and STEM classes all three years. Additionally, each student has a mentor and takes part in the school's humanities program.\n\nThough the recently passed amendment will add more students to Howard Street's total enrollment, and therefore affect class sizes, Tracy said they will continue to offer these programs and experiences.\n\n\"We don't want it to be perceived we aren't offering something of value,\" Tracy said. \"We are.\"\n\nFor the students who do attend, the results seem significant.\n\nTracy said students who attend for at least one year have an average four-year high school graduation rate of 93 percent, compared to the district's overall rate of 76.5 percent.\n\nSupport local journalism: Stay on top of educational trends and news in our area. Become a Statesman Journal subscriber today and get unlimited digital access to stories that matter.\n\nThey plan to increase diversity\n\nSalem-Keizer School Board members have had multiple conversations with Howard Street officials about the lack of racial diversity represented in the school's student population.\n\nAccording to 2017-18 data from the Oregon Department of Education, 81 percent of Howard Street's student population identifies as white. However, students of color make up about half of the total Salem-Keizer district population.\n\nTracy has talked publicly about the diversity the students of Howard Street do have — different languages spoken and different economic backgrounds, for example.\n\nBut she said the downtown location was chosen for this reason as well.\n\n\"When we knew we were going to have to move, we certainly looked at other locations,\" she said. \"We believe downtown will allow more people to access Howard Street through transportation and (its) general location.\n\n\"This is part of (our) commitment to making sure Howard Street is more diverse,\" she said.\n\nTracy said school staff are looking for other ways to increase diversity, such as marketing the school in more downtown locations and distributing information about the school earlier in elementary schools.\n\nWhen families apply for the lottery system, they do not include demographic information, so Tracy was not able to say if the diversity of the student population mirrored the diversity of applicants.\n\n\"We don't track the information on diversity when applying for lottery,\" she said. \"We don't think it should affect the lottery in any way.\"\n\nBehind the camera:How Salem resident Don Rogers won his Oscar\n\nEnrollment lottery is meant for all\n\nIn addition to concerns of student diversity, Salem-Keizer board members have brought up issues with the school's lottery system and questioned whether it's truly random.\n\nTracy has assured the board there is no targeted selection or favoritism in the lottery system. The only instance of added benefited, she said, is if a student applying has a sibling who is currently enrolled.\n\n\"They still have to fill out an application, but yes, then they would be grandfathered in,\" she said. \"Part of the reason ... is to keep families together.\"\n\nLottery applications are available on the school's website or in its main office. They are being accepted now and are due back to the school office by 4 p.m. March 8, with the lottery happening March 12.\n\nStaff will post about the lottery and results on the school's Facebook page, the district's website and the school's website. Families offered a position will be notified by phone.\n\nThose not offered a position will receive a letter saying where they are on the wait list. Tracy said the wait list carries over each year and allows students to get a spot anytime in the year should a student leave.\n\nFor more information, go to www.howardstreet.org or call 503-399-3408.\n\nContact reporter Natalie Pate at npate@StatesmanJournal.com, 503-399-6745 or follow her on Twitter @Nataliempate or Facebook at www.Facebook.com/nataliepatejournalist.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/05/07/delaware-school-board-election-guide-whos-running-in-your-district/73438239007/", "title": "Delaware school board election guide: Who's running in your district?", "text": "Correction: The Indian River School District was inadvertently left out of a previous version of this guide. It has been updated to include election information for the May 14 vote.\n\nDespite making up the largest body of elected officials across the nation, according to the ACLU, school board elections consistently show extremely low turnout. That was about 10% of Delaware voters in 2023, with several districts lower than 5% in turnout.\n\nThat makes each vote, your vote, increasingly influential.\n\nAnd while school board races are considered nonpartisan, these races have become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 14, polls will open once again for school board races throughout Delaware.\n\nContests are light. Per Delaware Code, no election will be held if there’s only one person running for a seat — thus leaving Brandywine, Christina, Caesar Rodney, Capital, Milford, Smyrna, Cape Henlopen, Laurel, Seaford and Districts 1 and 5 in Indian River without an election for that reason.\n\nWhich districts have elections?\n\nNew Castle County posts three contested races, in Appoquinimink, Colonial and Red Clay Consolidated school districts.\n\nKent County has one race, in the Lake Forest District, while Sussex County hosts contests in Indian River, Delmar and Woodbridge. Two districts are split between both counties, Smyrna and Milford, but neither has a contested race.\n\nWe took a look at the backgrounds of candidates across these ballots.

John Carney's proposed spending plan for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe governor also hopes to invest in building new schools, libraries and highway improvements, all while restoring some of last year's cuts to nonprofits and the state's prescription drug assistance program.\n\nDelaware residents, meanwhile, would not see any new tax hikes under the $4.25 billion budget proposal Carney unveiled to state lawmakers on Thursday.\n\nHis spending plan instead would use about 60 percent of the $170 million in extra revenue the state is expecting to have next year on one-time spending items.\n\n\"That's a very big number,\" he told legislators. \"But we have to keep an eye on the fact that it's only one time.\"\n\nRELATED:Carney calls for bipartisan approach in State of the State address\n\nRELATED:Delaware House expected to vote on sexual harassment rules this week\n\nThe remaining $70 million of new revenue – a combination of unspent funds from this year and more income next year than was previously projected – would be used to fund new expenses, such as raises and the expansion of existing programs.\n\nMuch of that added revenue depends on how the $1.5 trillion federal tax cuts approved in the December's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will impact state coffers – a large unknown even to Delaware's Finance Department. Carney's budget plan sets aside $10 million to deal with those impacts.\n\nYet Carney told reporters Wednesday that the real challenge will be convincing the General Assembly not to spend more than the 3.5-percent \"sustainable\" budget growth he is proposing – well beyond the 0.3 percent the governor pitched last year.\n\n\"When the Legislature sees surplus revenue in a given year, they think about its availability in that given year,\" he said. \"There is very little focus on the next year and the year after that. My job is to help them focus on that and not to plow unsustainable revenue ... into the operating budget.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley, called Carney's spending plan \"an election year budget.\"\n\n\"It's hard to be against a lot in it,\" he said. \"My biggest concern is where is this money coming from. We have a slow economy by any number of measures and yet we're looking at 3-5 percent budget growth.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said the governor's budget proposal is simply a starting point. Lawmakers typically use the governor's proposal as a blueprint for crafting their final spending plan, but it is the General Assembly that ultimately writes the state budget each year.\n\n\"There's a couple of things I like and a couple of things I'm not choked up about,\" he said, citing a desire to restore more of the nonprofit grant funding cut last year than Carney proposed.\n\nSchwartkopf said a possible tax hike also is not off the table.\n\n\"We still need to find a structural fix for our revenue issue,\" he said, noting that state expenses are growing by roughly 3.5 percent per year, while revenues are growing by 2 percent.\n\nTo help address that issue, Carney called for cuts across state government combined with a number of tax hikes to close a $386 million budget gap.\n\nDebate in the General Assembly about those measures led to lawmakers missing a June 30 deadline but ended with a final spending plan that cut spending while raising taxes on real estate transfers, tobacco, and alcohol. A proposed property tax hike was not adopted.\n\nThis year, Carney is proposing to use some of the revenue from those tax hikes to put more money in the pockets of 32,000 state workers, about 40 percent of whom will be eligible to retire in the next five years.\n\nThat includes providing an estimated 12,340 Delaware public school educators with a 2-percent raise at a total cost of $12.6 million. That would be in addition to the $10.2 million that would be used to fully fund pay increases already promised based on years of experience and another $20.9 million needed to cover the cost of hiring about 200 teachers statewide to account for increased student enrollment.\n\n\"We are pleased to see a proposal that invests money in salaries and benefits, particularly through pay raises, and family leave,\" said Mike Matthews, president of the Delaware State Educators Association. \"While it is only the beginning of the process, we look forward to working with Joint Finance Committee and the administration to produce a budget that makes his proposals a reality.\"\n\nThe state's roughly 1,280 correctional officers would receive the raises promised in the labor deal their union struck with the state last summer, at a total cost of $11.1 million. Another $3.6 million would be dedicated to paying for raises associated with officer promotions.\n\nThe added funding will help, but what the state's correctional officers really need is for the roughly 230 vacant positions to be filled, said Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. Understaffing was cited as a contributing factor to last year's 18-hour prison siege at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center that ultimately led to the death of Lt. Steven Floyd.\n\n\"We're satisfied with the direction the budget is going,\" he said. \"But until we get more staff in the facilities, we still have our main struggle and that's what we continue to push for.\"\n\nAbout 12,320 other state employees would get a flat $1,000 increase in pay at a total cost of $12.1. Carney also has set aside $1.2 million in his spending plan to cover the cost of a bill pending in the General Assembly that would provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave to hundreds of new parents employed by the state.\n\nThe Division of Family Services would add 30 new caseworkers to bolster investigations into child abuse and neglect, while 29 new positions would be added to the state's six juvenile detention facilities, under Carney's spending plan. Combined those new hires would cost about $4.6 million.\n\n\"Getting a flat raise really helps the people at the bottom of the pay scale most,\" said Mike Begatto, executive director of the of the Delaware chapter of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees.\n\n\"The caseworkers, for instance, are so dramatically overloaded and make such little money,\" he said. \"Hopefully, these raises will help bring up that bottom salary and make those jobs attractive.\"\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, is asking the General Assembly to dedicate the largest chunk of new spending to a combination of projects and initiatives aimed at improving the state's infrastructure, economy, and communities that he is calling Delaware Reinvest.\n\nThe list of investments using one-time operating revenue and bond funding totals $677.5 million, nearly 15 percent more than last year's capital budget.\n\nThat would include $391 million in federal and state dollars for road improvements and nearly $136 million to cover the state's share of building new schools in the Appoquinimink, Brandywine, Caesar Rodney and Cape Henlopen school districts.\n\nA flat $20 million would be allocated to the state's open space and farmland preservation programs, nearly as much for construction projects at University of Delaware, Delaware State University, and Delaware Technical Community College, and close to $7 million would be earmarked for money to build new libraries in Middletown and Smyrna.\n\nCarney also is suggesting the General Assembly restore about half of the 20-percent cuts in state grants to nonprofits that were enacted last year.\n\nThe governor's budget plan does include some spending cuts, totaling roughly $15 million, through a combination of Medicaid savings, a reduction in contractual employees, a new contract for energy procurement and fewer positions in the Department of Education.\n\nBut those cuts are minuscule compared to the slew of targeted, one-time spending proposals in Carney's budget proposal, such as:\n\nEducation\n\n$16.5 million to help improve education in the five struggling Christina School District school located in Wilmington;\n\n$6 million for the Opportunity Grants program that assists schools serving high poverty and non-English speaking students – a three-fold increase over the current allocation. The program would shift from a competitive grant-program to automatic funding;\n\n$3.8 million for the Delaware Stars for Early Sucess, which offers training for early child care providers;\n\n$1.1 million for the SEED and INSPIRE scholarship programs that help Delaware high school students attend local colleges;\n\nState programs\n\n$7.8 million for renovations at the Carvel State Office Building in Wilmington and to address a backlog of maintenance needs at other state facilities;\n\n$4 million to implement improvements in the Department of Correction, including funds to cover staff training, add behavioral therapy for offenders, install security equipment and cameras, and purchase ballistic vests;\n\nHealth\n\nAn additional $1.4 million to provide more resources for substance abuse treatment, bringing the total federal and state funding to $23.7 million;\n\n$2 million for prescription assistance for Delaware seniors;\n\n$285,000 to fund resources for infants born with drug addictions.\n\n\"The objective here was to make modest, sustainable investments in areas like public education, in our communities and in the economy to create a stronger state going into the future,\" Carney said. \"The emphasis is on the word sustainable.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/25"}]}

As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "Devika Rao", "Peter Weber", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-poweroutages-friday/index.html", "title": "At least 9 dead as massive winter storm leaves more than a million ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive winter storm battered the US on Friday with frigid temperatures, high winds and heavy snow, leaving at least nine people dead, knocking out power to over a million customers and wrecking holiday plans from coast to coast.\n\nThe storm – expected to intensify throughout Friday as it barrels through the Midwest and East – is making for grim road conditions with poor visibility and ice-covered streets. Coastal flooding is also an issue, particularly along the shorelines of the Northeast.\n\nAll modes of travel – planes, trains and automobiles – were being disrupted: There were hundreds of miles of road closures and flight cancellations were growing rapidly. In New York, flooding along the Long Island Rail Road forced part of the Long Beach branch to temporarily shut down.\n\nRelated: Follow live updates\n\n“Christmas is canceled,” said Mick Saunders, a Buffalo, New York, resident who was two hours into blizzard conditions that are expected to last through Sunday morning. “All family and friends agreed it’s safer this way.”\n\nAt least 9 deaths have been reported since Wednesday.\n\nIn north-central Kansas, three people were killed in separate car crashes on Wednesday evening; one death was confirmed to be weather-related, and two were believed to be weather-related but need more investigation, according to Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson Lt. Candice Breshears.\n\nIn Kansas City, one person died after losing control of their Dodge Caravan on icy roads Thursday afternoon, according to the Kansas City Police Department. “The Dodge went down the embankment, over the cement retaining wall and landed upside down, submerged in Brush Creek,” police said in a statement.\n\nIn Kentucky, three people died due to the storm, including two in vehicle crashes and the other a “housing insecure” person in Louisville, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The man’s body was found outside with no obvious signs of trauma and an autopsy would determine the cause of death, police said.\n\nAnd in Ohio, four people have died “as a result of weather-related auto accidents” and several others have been injured, according to Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nLife threatening cold has pushed all the way to the Gulf Coast and the Mexican border, with below zero wind chills reported as far south as Austin and Atlanta. Many locations in the eastern US are in for their coldest Christmas Eve in decades as the Arctic blast reaches its peak.\n\nMore than one million customers in the US are experiencing power outages amid the winter weather and frigid temperatures, according to the website PowerOutage.US. Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania have the most outages.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/13/charlottesville-remembered-drive-thru-ban-ketchup-karma-news-around-states/39948077/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state has set its first hunting season for sandhill cranes in more than a century. The state wildlife agency says a limited number of hunters will be allowed to kill the migratory birds over two periods beginning Dec. 3. The state says it last allowed sandhill crane hunting in 1916. It says the species has made enough of a comeback in recent decades to allow hunters to go after them. Kentucky and Tennessee are the only other states east of the Mississippi River to allow hunting of the animals. More than a dozen Western states have crane seasons. The department says it will allow 400 permits for sandhill crane hunters over the season. Some people like eating the big birds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The governor is seeking to tighten the rules for food stamp recipients. The Anchorage Daily News reports Gov.

The Republican governor’s spokesman says the administration wants the change in order “to comply with the spirit and intent” of federal rules. The Food Bank of Alaska says the change will further heighten food insecurity at a time when assistance services are already strained by the governor’s recent, deep budget vetoes.\n\nArizona\n\nFlorence: Pinal County authorities want to prepare inmates with skills to help them have a successful future once they get out of jail. The county Sheriff’s Office is partnering with a technology company to bring computer tablets to the inmates at the adult detention center. The county’s jail houses an average of 500 inmates a day. The tablets are monitored, and the inmates are aware that their activities and all forms of conversations are monitored, which is standard practice at all detention facilities. Sheriff Mark Lamb told the Casa Grande Dispatch that inmates can use tablets to help advance their education and gain skills while they are incarcerated, prepare themselves for a future job or even work toward a high school diploma.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Initial information for the Connect Northwest Arkansas transit development plan confirms the region’s residents want a more developed transit system. Tim Simon of Alliance Transportation Group, the consulting firm commissioned by the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission to do the $280,000 study and plan, recently presented the first draft to stakeholders. A transit plan for the region was last adopted in 2010. The new plan will focus on public education and establishing fixed bus routes throughout the region, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The plan will be developed specifically for the two public transit providers, Ozark Regional Transit and University of Arkansas Razorback Transit, to define their roles in a regional system.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHoopa: They probably don’t train people for this at the Sheriff’s Academy. A patrol car was struck by a falling bear, officials in Northern California say. A Humboldt County sheriff’s deputy was driving on State Route 96 on Aug. 3, answering a report of a drug overdose in the community of Orleans, when the bear fell or jumped onto the car, apparently from a steep embankment, authorities say. The bear smashed the hood and windshield. The patrol car hit an embankment, rolled onto its side and burst into flames. The deputy managed to escape without serious injury. The fire was contained to about half an acre, but the car was gutted. However, the California Department of Transportation offered a reassurance: “Don’t worry, the bear also fled the scene.”\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Another city in the Centennial State is refusing to do business with a company partly due to its ties to immigration enforcement. Boulder police told ankle monitor maker BI Incorporated last week that it will no longer allow off-duty police officers to be hired for extra security at its headquarters. It works with immigration and other authorities and is owned by GEO Group, which operates the immigration detention center in suburban Denver. The decision was prompted by objections from residents and citizens’ groups to the city having contracts with GEO and CoreCivic or its subsidiaries following Denver’s decision to cut ties with the halfway houses they operate. A BI spokesman, Rich Coolidge, says the move sets a dangerous precedent because he says it puts partisan political decisions above public safety.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s “distressed” dairy industry will be the subject of an informational forum Tuesday at the Legislative Office Building. Members of the General Assembly’s “rural caucus” have invited dairy farmers from Franklin and Hebron, the executive director of the Connecticut Farm Bureau, the assistant director of the Cooperative Extension System at the University of Connecticut, and Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt. In Connecticut and across the country, farmers for years have been grappling with low milk prices they cannot control. As of January, there were 108 dairy farms in the state, including cattle, goat and sheep milk producers. Connecticut’s dairy industry has been estimated to contribute more than $1 billion annually to its economy.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Students soon will be able to ride a DART bus with passes paid for by their schools. A new state law will allow district and charter schools to buy and provide annual passes for students to use buses from the Delaware Transit Corp. Sen. Laura Sturgeon D-Brandywine West, the legislation’s main sponsor, says it is designed to make school choice more equitable. It will also help students get to after-school jobs and volunteer opportunities and help a new generation become more familiar with public transportation. “We have school choice in Delaware, but not all students can access it,” she says. The bill is aimed at students in grades six through 12. Schools will not be required to provide the passes. Each district and charter school will negotiate the purchase with DART, but each pass is expected to cost $450 annually, a steep discount, says John Sisson, DART’s chief executive officer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With the district reaching its 100th homicide of the year, one teen is coping by opening up a conversation on YouTube. Sean Johnson, 15, has grown up in southeast D.C., witnessing regular violence, WUSA-TV reports. He tutored 11-year-old Karon Brown, who was shot to death in July. “When I heard about the shooting, it really got me heartbroken because, you know, I used to help this kid,” Sean says. Moments like that pushed him to start the series set up like a Q&A about the neighborhood. “Basically, people who have never been to southeast, they need to know how it is because people are quick to put stereotypes on southeast and say, like, ‘Oh, it’s a bad neighborhood,’ but it really depends,” he says. Sean says kids are afraid to speak up and stand out, thinking they’ll become a target, but it’s important to open up the conversation to create any kind of change.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: After 2018’s high ecological toll, red tide is at normal background levels this year. A blue-green algae bloom this summer has stayed mostly on Lake Okeechobee since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lowered lake levels earlier this year to avoid discharging large volumes of water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers. Large fish kills haven’t been reported along the coast in several months, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the number of sea turtle hatchlings across the region may set a record by autumn. “We ended up with 133 (sea turtles) stranding last year, which is really bad. It was a terrible red tide,” says Maura Kraus, with Collier County’s sea turtle program. Sea turtle nesting season runs through Oct. 31.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A drug charge has been dropped against a Georgia Southern quarterback after a white substance he identified as bird poop on his car’s hood tested negative for cocaine. A Saluda County Sheriff’s Office police report says deputies pulled Shai Werts over for speeding July 31 and noticed two white spots on his car they thought were cocaine. The report says Werts told them it was bird poop he had tried to wash off. The deputies then did a field test that came back positive for cocaine and charged him with possession of the drug. Werts’ lawyer Townes Jones IV told The Savannah Morning News more sophisticated lab testing showed the substance was not cocaine, and the drug charge was dropped. Jones says prosecutors told him the original speeding charge remains.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Astronomers across 11 observatories on the state’s tallest mountain have canceled more than 2,000 hours of telescope viewing over the past four weeks because a protest blocked a road to the summit. The lost research atop Mauna Kea includes work on clouds of gas and dust on the verge of forming stars, as well as asteroids that might come close to or even hit Earth. Mauna Kea is one of the world’s premier sites for studying the skies. Native Hawaiian protesters are blocking the road to prevent the construction of another telescope, which they fear will further harm a peak they consider sacred. Astronomers said Friday that they’ll attempt to resume observations but in some cases won’t be able to make up the missed research. Protesters say they shouldn’t be blamed for the shutdown.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Nez Perce Tribe is suing a Canadian mining company contending the company is illegally allowing arsenic, cyanide and mercury to pollute a central Idaho area to which the tribe has hunting and fishing rights from an 1855 treaty with the United States. The tribe filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court seeking to force British Columbia-based Midas Gold and three Idaho-based subsidiaries to stop discharging pollutants. Midas Gold has never mined in the area about 40 miles east of McCall but in the last decade has acquired mining claims and developed a plan it says will ultimately clean up the mess left by a century of mining by other companies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has spent $4 million since the 1990s trying to clean up the area that includes streams with federally protected salmon.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois has launched a two-year study and is offering free soil tests to home gardeners and urban farmers across the area. It’s called the Chicago Safe Soils Initiative. Professor Andrew Margenot, the leader of the project, says cities can often be “hotspots” for heavy metals like lead. He and others will be collecting thousands of soil samples from backyards, community gardens and urban farms in the next two years. They plan to map out what they find and make it publicly available. University officials say it’s common to find high lead levels near roads and houses built before 1978, when paint containing lead was banned. Participants will have to fill out a sample soil intake form.\n\nIndiana\n\nYorktown: Elected officials have come out against a proposed steel dust recycling plant, saying the nearby project would hurt local property values. The Yorktown Town Council posted a notice Friday on the town’s Facebook page declaring its opposition to the plant proposed in adjacent Muncie. That notice says the construction and operation of the hazardous waste recycling plant would harm property values and wouldn’t be “an attractive nor viable partner in the development of our community.” Waelz Sustainable Products has not yet obtained a construction permit from Indiana regulators. The plant would recycle trainloads of steel dust, a hazardous waste. Mercury, lead and other toxic air pollutants would be released during a rotary kiln process to recover zinc and iron.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The city has hired an engineering firm to help guide repairs to the inflatable dam on the Cedar River downtown. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports the City Council has authorized spending up to $27,500 for AECOM Technical Services to develop plans for a process to determine why the rubber bladder dam is leaking air. The company will prepare a contract for a private contractor that will install temporary gates to keep water away while engineers inspect the dam to find the leak or leaks and make plans for repairs. The city intends to have parts and patches on hand to make repairs while the water is diverted for the inspection. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Leaders of an anti-vaccination group in the state say their membership numbers are surging in response to two new immunization requirements for schoolchildren. As of Aug. 2, Kansas is requiring students beginning in seventh grade to receive a meningitis vaccine. And students entering kindergarten or first grade need two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine. The shots are required for children in public or private schools. Connie Newcome, president of Kansans for Health Freedom, says the nonprofit group has grown dramatically. She says Kansans want to make their own decisions about vaccines without the government telling them what to do. The Kansas City Star reports the opposition comes as state health officials are trying to improve Kansas’ low ranking for the meningitis vaccine, and an only slightly better ranking for hepatitis A vaccinations.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Officials say a section of Mammoth Cave National Park will be closed for more than a year for renovations. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer told the Daily News that a 2-mile section of cave stretching from the Snowball Room to Grand Central Station will close sometime this fall and isn’t expected to reopen for 18 months. Schroer said the dirt and stone cave floor has become degraded, and the project will make the path smoother and more durable while making steps and handrails more user-friendly. She said the Grand Avenue Tour and the Wild Cave Tour won’t be available for the entire closure. Others tours, including Domes and Dripstones and Frozen Niagara, would be closed for only part of the renovation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has a new poet laureate, with a background well beyond fine arts. John Warner Smith’s tenure in the two-year position begins Wednesday. He teaches English at Southern University in Baton Rouge and has published four collections of poetry since 2015. But before that, Smith worked as Louisiana labor secretary under former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, and he has been a banker. He has degrees in fine arts, business administration, psychology and accounting. Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities announced Smith’s selection. Edwards described Smith’s poetry as passionate and called him a “trailblazer” who is devoted to education. Smith takes over from Jack Bedell, who has been Louisiana’s poet laureate since 2017.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Endangered piping plovers have fledged 165 chicks so far this summer for a new record in the state. The Maine Audubon reports that the number of chicks represents a 29% increase over last year. And it follows a 30% increase last year. Laura Minich Zitsk, director of Maine’s Piping Plover Project, tells the Portland Press Herald that the number of nesting pairs is “incredible.” The most recent state tally found 89 nesting pairs of piping plovers on Maine beaches. That’s up from 68 last year. Henry Jones of the Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department says the gains were aided by work by federal, state and local agencies over the past decade. The shorebird has been on the federal endangered species list since 1986.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Johns Hopkins University has fired an associate research professor over his confrontation with students participating in a sit-in at a campus building where he worked. The Sun reports that a letter written by the university’s vice dean for faculty says Daniel Povey has been fired for jeopardizing student safety. The newspaper says Povey posted his termination letter online. His firing takes effect Aug. 31. Povey initially was placed on administrative leave after the night in May when he used bolt cutters to enter a building and access computer servers hosting his research. Students who had occupied the building for weeks were protesting legislation that would allow John Hopkins to create an armed campus police force. Povey told The Sun he believed protesters “weren’t going to get what they wanted.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Registry of Motor Vehicles is holding its annual lottery for much sought-after low-number vehicle license plates. Entries are being accepted online until Aug. 23. Mailed entries must be postmarked by that date. The winners will be announced Sept. 15. Only one entry per applicant will be accepted, and applicants must be a Massachusetts resident with a currently active, registered and insured passenger vehicle. People with suspended or revoked registrations or licenses are not eligible. Applicants are not allowed to request specific numbers. Among the numbers available in this year’s lottery are B1, 3000, 27A and K5. For years, low-number plates were handed out to the politically connected until the lottery system was put into place.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Wayne County prosecutors are commemorating the 10th anniversary of a push to test thousands of sexual assault kits found in a Detroit police evidence warehouse. Highlights of the initiative will be discussed Wednesday during an invitation-only event. More than 11,000 rape kits were discovered in the warehouse in 2009. Those kits contained DNA and other evidence from rape cases, but a majority of the 11,000 kits were never tested in a lab. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy pushed efforts to test the kits and prosecute old cases. Through May 2018, 130 people had been convicted and 818 serial sex offenders identified after authorities started investigating earlier batches of the kits. Thousands of untested kits also have been found at other police departments across the nation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local planners say the city is the first of its size in the country to ban new drive-through windows. The City Council voted Thursday to ban new construction of drive-through facilities. The existing ones are grandfathered. Council President Lisa Bender proposed the ban last year to cut down on vehicle noise, idling and traffic and to make sidewalks safer for pedestrians. New drive-through windows have already been prohibited in 17 of the city’s 23 zoning districts. The Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan approved by the council last year directs the city to outlaw new drive-through facilities and gas stations.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Tulane University is no longer operating on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast. WLOX-TV reports students took their last final exam Thursday – the last day of classes for the campus in Biloxi. The campus has been in Biloxi since 2001. The university announced the closing in 2018. Officials said dwindling numbers of enrollment created the need to close. At the beginning of the 2018 fall semester, 92 students were enrolled. The largest enrollment was in 2011 with 205 students. Media arts instructor Ronald Warr tells the station the closure hurts. He says it feels like he’s been punched in the gut. Affected students have opted to continue with online classes, attend classes at the New Orleans campus, or take their credits and transfer to another institution.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: A museum dedicated to the late actress Ginger Rogers will close after only one year of operation. Rogers, who was born in Independence, is most famous as the dancing partner for Fred Astaire in the 1930s and ’40s. Marge and Gene Padgitt opened the museum last year in the home where Rogers and her mother, writer Lela Owens-Rogers, lived. The Independence Examiner reports Marge Padgitt said the museum didn’t have enough visitors and doesn’t have enough space to hold donated items. The museum will be open Wednesdays and Saturdays through September. The couple still hopes to acquire a larger building for a museum dedicated to Jackson County history and celebrities who lived in the area, including Rogers, Walt Disney, actor Jean Harlow, actor William Powell, and Jesse and Frank James.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Health officials have proposed a series of rules for schools in the state, including requiring districts to create plans for how they would make buildings airtight. The Billings Gazette reports the state Department of Health and Human Services’ rule for sealing school buildings from the outside air aims to protect against wildfire smoke and other air hazards. The proposal also includes requirements for schools to regularly inspect air systems and to test water for lead. Education groups have been critical of the proposed rules, saying the process was rushed and hoping the department would clarify its expectations. The department says several school groups had the chance to weigh in, and it has considered the economic impact of the rules. The department is taking public comment on the proposal until Sept. 16.\n\nNebraska\n\nFairbury: A living history event scheduled for this weekend at Rock Creek Station State Historical Park will show what everyday life was like in the Nebraska Territory in 1864. Historians will inhabit the park’s reconstructed road ranch Saturday, demonstrating haying, carpentry, blacksmithing and stock tending. Rock Creek Station was established in 1857 along the Oregon and California trails. It was a supply center and resting spot for westward emigrants and later became a Pony Express relay station. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission developed it as a state historical park in 1980. The park sits about 6 miles east of Fairbury in Jefferson County. Call the park at 402-729-5777 for more information. A park entry permit is required.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Wild horses are being rounded up throughout the state this summer by federal land managers who say they are preserving land and protecting herds while water and food sources become scarce. A U.S. Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman tells the Las Vegas Sun it’s horrifying to see animals starving on the range, and the logical and humane thing to do is manage the population. But some wild horse advocates want to do away with roundups, saying they rely on faulty figures, waste resources and harm horses. They say the bureau already has 46,000 captured horses in taxpayer-funded corrals. The Sun reports the number of mustangs and mares in captivity nearly equals the estimated 48,300 on the range in Nevada, a state with more than half the U.S. wild horse and burro population.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPittsfield: The state has put the kibosh on a farm stand’s ice cream made from raw milk. Jill Fudala says her ice cream made from goat milk and sold in cherry walnut, black raspberry and other flavors was a hit – until the state stepped in. The Boston Globe reports that customers could pay on the honor system at her farm stand. That was before the state Department of Health and Human Services threatened to fine Fudala unless she stopped selling the ice cream. The department contends processed dairy products must be made with pasteurized milk. State Rep. James Allard says he hopes to help Fudala return to her ice cream production. He’s exploring whether to submit a bill “to update the language” of the state law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLacey Township: Heinz is offering to help a person who fears that the theft of a bottle of ketchup has led to bad luck. The thief took a bottle from a New Jersey restaurant. But when the person got into a car accident and experienced other misfortunes, they returned two bottles to the eatery, with a note of apology. The note said the theft of the ketchup was the worst thing the person had ever done, but he or she was seeking to do something “risky.” Heinz offered on Twitter to pay for the damage from the car accident if the thief contacted the Pittsburgh-based company. The company said: “Heinz makes you do crazy things.” Heinz posted Friday that it found the person, whose identity it has promised to protect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials believe they may have found one of the missing trees planted in the state from seeds taken to the moon during the Apollo 14 mission. KOAT-TV reports former New Mexico first lady Clara Apodaca and a naturalist identified a tree last week that they believe to be one of those planted in the state four decades ago. Apodaca and the naturalist say a Douglas fir in a grassy area north of the state Capitol in Santa Fe is a moon tree. Apodaca helped plant it. The discovery comes after the Albuquerque station reported that officials where the trees were planted decades ago said they have lost track of the trees. Moon trees were grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the moon by former U.S. Forest Service smokejumper Stuart Roosa during the 1971 mission.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is appealing a court decision that has halted trail work in the Adirondacks. The Department of Environmental Conservation is asking the state’s highest court to reverse a mid-level court ruling in a lawsuit filed by the environmental group Protect the Adirondacks. The group sued in 2013, claiming the state was cutting 25,000 trees to make its new “community connector” snowmobile trails. The state said the number was far less. The “Forever Wild” clause of the state constitution prohibits removal of excessive amounts of timber in the Forest Preserve. At issue in the court case is the definition of “tree.” The state says trees less than 3 inches in diameter don’t count, but the lawsuit argued slender trees can be very old and important to the forest ecology.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Thousands of old court documents – some going back 350 years – could soon be more accessible to the public thanks in part to a federal grant. The State Archives of North Carolina is getting $140,000 toward a project designed to expand an online catalog that helps historians and other citizens know names and places within hard-to-decipher records. An improved index means they’ll know which documents they want to go read in person. State Archivist Sarah Koonts says the documents shed light on early North Carolina society and include wills and estates and bridge and road information. A sample of these documents will be posted online as part of the project. Workshops will be held for participants to learn how to transcribe the documents’ elegant cursive handwriting.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: As law enforcement agencies across the state begin a concentrated effort to catch impaired drivers, some 60 law enforcement officers will be using their specially trained skills to detect motorists who are high on drugs. About 20 agencies across the state employ officers who have taken the rigorous, internationally utilized program that helps law enforcement identify drivers who are under the influence of drugs other than alcohol. North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper Tarek Chase coordinates the state’s drug recognition expert training program. Chase tells the Bismarck Tribune law enforcement officers statewide have noticed an increase in drug-impaired driving. Agencies statewide begin a “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” enforcement campaign Friday. It runs through Sept. 2.\n\nOhio\n\nMansfield: It’s been 25 years since Red and Andy were reunited at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and an event this weekend will reunite many of those who helped film “The Shawshank Redemption” here. Fans can meet cast members Friday through Sunday. The weekend’s festivities start at 6 p.m Friday with a screening of the movie at the Renaissance Theatre. The following two days will be filled with events at the Ohio State Reformatory, the facility also known as Shawshank State Prison. But to the tens of thousands of inmates who lived there between 1896 to 1990, the prison was known as “Dracula’s Castle,” Mark Dawidziak explained in his recently published book, “The Shawshank Redemption Revealed.” Dawidziak will be among those available to meet guests over the weekend, to tell them about his behind-the-scenes look into the making of the film.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Democratic lawmaker from the city is joining forces with gun safety advocates seeking a public vote on whether to overturn a state law that will allow people in the state to openly carry firearms without a background check or training. Rep. Jason Lowe announced plans Monday for a referendum petition on the bill that passed overwhelmingly last session and quickly became the first signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill is scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. Supporters of the repeal will face a tight deadline to gather the nearly 60,000 signatures before the end of August to get the question on ballot in 2020. Lowe’s announcement comes less than two weeks after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left more than 30 people dead.\n\nOregon\n\nGrants Pass: A county fair is setting up a “free-expression area,” with restrictions on bullhorns, signs and sound systems. The Daily Courier reports the Josephine County Fair is setting up a 30-by-30-foot outdoor area near two of the entrances to a building where vendors will be set up for the upcoming fair. The fair board recently banned signs except in areas where vendors and others have paid a fee to use them. Fairgrounds director Tamra Martin says efforts have been made to create a “family-friendly,” entertaining event. She says the location of the “free-expression area” provides visibility for those wanting to be heard. Kelly Simon with the American Civil Liberties Union in Portland says limits on free speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a government interest.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkes-Barre: Officials say a man broke into a Planned Parenthood office, smashing glass doors and painting graffiti on the walls. Melissa Reed, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Keystone, said surveillance images show a man throwing a brick through a window of the Wilkes-Barre office about 2 a.m. Monday. She said the same man returned about an hour later with another brick, smashed other windows, climbed through the door and spray-painted graffiti including a biblical verse in red. Planned Parenthood Keystone said in a statement that the act was “aimed to intimidate, threaten and instill fear.” Reed said the office offers birth control, cancer screenings, general health care, STD testing, pregnancy testing and the morning-after pill but does not perform surgical abortions on site.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Department of Environmental Management is surveying the state’s lakes, ponds and rivers this summer as part of an annual monitoring program to identify invasive aquatic species. During a survey June 12 in Barney Pond in Lincoln, DEM staff removed several small water chestnut plants that were scattered throughout the pond. Water chestnut hadn’t been previously documented in Barney Pond or its watershed, so DEM alerted the town of Lincoln and searched for the source of the invasive plants. A large patch of water chestnut plants was found upstream in Olney Pond. The invasive plants were removed as part of conservation efforts to protect Olney Pond’s habitat. The public is asked to take photos and report suspected new findings of water chestnut plants to DEM.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A 101-year-old farming and fellowship tradition won’t continue this year in rural South Carolina and may be over for good. The Herald of Rock Hill reports the annual Hopewell Day where people in western York County gather to eat beef hash and listen to gospel music and political speeches won’t take place in 2019. Hopewell Day was celebrated the third Wednesday in August after many farmers finished their harvests. But organizer Melvin Howell says attendance is dwindling, and there aren’t enough volunteers because of school starting back. Other organizers say they will discuss moving the event to the weekend if it is held in 2020. Hash is made from beef, onions, butter and salt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An official of Rapid City Regional Airport acknowledges the airport recently dumped sewage without permission from state regulators. The Rapid City Journal reports the airport dumped about 74,100 gallons of sewage on the northern end of its property this past week without permission of the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Airport executive director Patrick Dame says that the airport contacted the department before it dumped the sewage but that the agency did not make it clear a permit was necessary. He says the airport has been looking at ways to remove excess wastewater that accumulated in its septic lagoon due to the combination of heavy rain and increased passenger traffic this summer. A DENR spokesman says the agency is trying to determine if any contamination has occurred.\n\nTennessee\n\nRed Boiling Springs: News outlets report two former students are accused of breaking into their high school and stealing an AR-15 and bulletproof vests from the resource officer’s gun safe. Clay and Macon County authorities say Lee Clark and Adam Cisneros were spotted on video inside Red Boiling Springs School last week. Deputies say the items were found buried behind Clark’s home. WTVF reports Macon schools director Tony Boles says a sheriff’s department policy allows officers to bring personal guns to campus along with their service weapons. Groups advocating against gun violence are questioning how the kids got into the safe. Beth Joslin Roth of the Safe Tennessee Project says she also wonders why an officer would have an assault weapon at school, given how imprecisely they are designed to fire.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Joe Walsh will be joined by ZZ Top, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit at his VetsAid music festival to benefit veterans. The award-winning musician announced Monday that tickets for the Nov. 10 concert at the Toyota Center in Houston will go on sale Friday. In its first two years, net proceeds have allowed VetsAid to disburse nearly $1.2 million in grants. Grants this year will go to Houston-area organizations. In a statement, Walsh says that “all are welcome to celebrate the things that unite us as Americans: good friends, open hearts and great music!” Walsh’s father died while stationed on Okinawa, Japan, when the musician was 20 months old. He offers free guitar lessons to wounded veterans at Walter Reed National Medical Center, outside Washington.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Authorities say the state’s prison population has grown faster than most states in the past few years. KSL-TV reports the Utah Sentencing Commission saw a dramatic surge in prison population as new crimes and drug violations led to more convictions. The U.S. Department of Justice reported in April that Utah’s prison population increased by 4.3% from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, faster than every state except Idaho at 5.1%. State authorities say the average daily inmate population continued to increase, adding 165 prisoners between August 2018 and July 2019. Authorities say more people returning to prison on technical violations, including nonviolent petty crimes, drove increases. Officials say they expected Utah’s prison population to rise with the increase in the state’s general population.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont Fish and Wildlife staff have been busy as beavers this summer trying to prevent flooding on roads and private property. The agency has installed 11 water control devices on beaver dams throughout the state. Known as “beaver baffles,” the devices allow some water to pass through the dam without breaching it and destroying wetlands. Officials say the devices can help reduce flooding and minimize property damage while preserving wetlands that provide critical habitat for songbirds, otters, moose and other wildlife. Beavers had disappeared from Vermont by the early 1700s due to unregulated trapping and habit degradation. Fish and Wildlife reintroduced them in the 1920s, and they are now widespread.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: City residents marked the second anniversary of a deadly white nationalist rally with a series of peaceful community events. About 20 people gathered Monday afternoon for a moment of silence at the site where an avowed white nationalist plowed a car into a crowd of people, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more. Flowers and signs decorated a memorial to Heyer. The Aug. 12, 2017, rally drew a mix of violent far-right extremists. Brawls broke out with anti-racism protesters, and authorities eventually forced the crowds to disperse. The car attack came later as peaceful counterprotesters were marching through downtown. Two state troopers involved in surveillance were killed when their helicopter crashed. Other events marking the second anniversary included a ballet performance and a worship service.\n\nWashington\n\nMetaline Falls: Times are tough in a rural county in the state’s northeast because one of the region’s biggest employers is shutting down. The Pend Oreille Mine, just north of Metaline Falls, closed July 31, at a cost of about 200 family wage jobs in an area of less than 1,000 residents. It’s another sign of the imbalance of prosperity in Washington state.

City Walk BHAM will be located under Interstate 59/20, which was recently rebuilt and lies between the main downtown area and the city’s civic center, indoor arena and new football stadium, which is opening this fall. Construction began recently, and officials hope the project will be done by July 2022, when Birmingham will host the World Games, an international sporting event. The project will cover the length of 10 city blocks. Plans include areas for markets, sports fields, green spaces, a dog park, a skate park, performances and food trucks. Birmingham-based Brasfield and Gorrie is the main contractor working on the project.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The leaders of the state’s Republican Party on Saturday endorsed a challenger to incumbent U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has been one of the GOP’s most outspoken critics of former President Donald Trump, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The Alaska Republican State Central Committee endorsed Kelly Tshibaka in the 2022 race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Murkowski. The committee approved Tshibaka’s endorsement in a 58-17 vote during a meeting in Fairbanks, the newspaper reports. In a statement, Tshibaka said she will uphold conservative ideals and be a senator who Alaskans “can depend to make every decision based on what is best for our great state.” Tshibaka, who ran the Alaska Department of Administration, announced March 29 that she would run for the Senate seat held by Murkowski, who has been in office since 2002. On March 13, the Republican State Central Committee voted 53-17 to censure Murkowski, citing her vote to impeach Trump and other votes that have broken with GOP leadership. Alaska Republican Party leaders said at the time that they would recruit someone to run against her. Trump has endorsed Tshibaka. “Lisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,” the former president said in a statement last month. “Murkowski has got to go!”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A Boy Scout council that serves most of the state plans to sell its main summer camp near Payson and part of a Phoenix facility to help the national organization settle claims by thousands of victims of child sex abuse. The Phoenix-based Grand Canyon Council said it will sell Camp Geronimo and 10 acres of Heard Scout Pueblo and shift its summer camp operations to Camp Raymond near Flagstaff. “This option leverages the high net value of Camp Geronimo and the rising real estate values in Arizona against our program needs; we will retain the most-used portion of the Heard while giving up the portion under-utilized by us yet highly valued to others,” the council said Wednesday on its website. The council said it must contribute just over $7 million toward the settlement and reviewed its options carefully. “The process has been difficult and at times emotional, as everyone has strong ties to our various camps, and each is loved for its own special characteristics.” The council serves most of central and northern Arizona. The Tucson-based Catalina Council serves most of southern Arizona, while parts of northwestern and northeastern Arizona are served by councils based respectively in Las Vegas and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The authenticity of a United Nations designation that was given to the city by an artist is now being questioned. At a ceremony last Tuesday, Nigerian artist Ibiyinka Alao announced Fort Smith became the 10th city in the world to be declared a “United Nations international city for artistic and cultural innovation in peace building and economic growth.” Fort Smith Mayor George McGill attended the event. Alao, who is a guest artist in residence with a nonprofit group in nearby Rogers, said the U.N. declaration is given to cities that support the arts. Alao is described as a U.N. art ambassador. But Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general of the U.N., said he is not aware of an “ambassador of the arts” in the organization. He also said the U.N. does not designate cities with the title Alao gave Fort Smith. “This has all the hallmarks of a scam,” Dujarric told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He said the U.N. legal team has been notified of the situation. Asked Friday about Dujarric’s statement, Alao said it was simply his assessment. He said the word “designation,” which Dujarric used and has been used in news articles to describe the declaration, is misleading: “It’s just a declaration, which is my assessment of what a city is doing to foster the arts, use the arts as a tool for economic development and peace building.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nIndio: Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Luke Combs are slated to headline the return of the Stagecoach Festival next spring. Other festival highlights include Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and country legend Tanya Tucker on Friday, April 29, masked country singer Orville Peck and alternative country vocalist Margo Price on Saturday, April 30, and rock band The Black Crowes and Motown legend Smokey Robinson on Sunday, May 1. A summer announcement is unusual, as the lineup is typically released in October. Los Angeles-based producer Goldenvoice announced on the Stagecoach Twitter last week that it was forgoing an advance sale in lieu of an early lineup release. Both Coachella and Stagecoach were postponed twice before the April 2021 dates were canceled. Some fans hoped the festivals would be rescheduled for October, as the city of Indio has a contract with Goldenvoice that allows for five concerts each year. Rhett and Underwood were announced as headliners for the 2020 festival, along with Eric Church. The previous lineup also included Billy Ray Cyrus, ZZ Top and Alan Jackson and Bryan Adams.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Ahead of Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game this week, city officials are facing scrutiny from advocates who accuse them of accelerating the clearing of homeless encampments near Coors Field as the sports world turns its attention to Colorado’s capital city. Mayor Michael Hancock has emphatically denied that the All-Star Game influenced any clearing decisions, saying the city is just getting caught up after suspending cleanups at the beginning of the pandemic. It resumed regular cleanups last summer. Officials knew before the city was chosen as the All-Star host that it faced a big cleanup effort, with more encampments than ever, Hancock said. In cleanups, also called homeless “sweeps,” encampments are fenced off, and the people living in tents there are told to pack up and leave so the area can be cleaned. In March, just before Denver was chosen as a substitute host – Major League Baseball pulled it from Atlanta in April over objections to Georgia’s voting law that critics condemned as being too restrictive – data shows sweeps increased, with cleanups taking place over nine days. The previous peak over the past year was eight days, in October. But the sweeps picked up even more in May and June with 17 scheduled cleanups taking 22 days, according to public records first reported by online news outlet Denverite.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Six National Guard soldiers were sent to the hospital for observation Monday after experiencing heat-related issued during a training march. Maj. Dave Pytlik, a spokesperson with the Connecticut National Guard, said the soldiers were among several dozen participating this week in officer training school at the Guard’s Stone’s Ranch Military Reservation in East Lyme. Monday is what is known as “ruck march” day, when the soldiers carry heavy backpacks on a rigorous 6-mile training march, he said. Pytlik said medical personnel, including a doctor, were on hand as part of precautions for the early morning march and responded appropriately to treat those suffering dehydration and other heat-related symptoms. “The issue is that someone came on the network and used the term ‘mass-casualty incident’ and said someone was unresponsive,” he said. “There was nobody who was unresponsive, and mass-casualty kind of means something different in the world than it means to us.” He said the six soldiers were taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London for observation, but nobody was seriously injured. Pytlik said minor injuries and dehydration are relatively common issues during training marches.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles is turning its operations back to pre-COVID-19 “normal” conditions. That means DMV buildings will return to full capacity, among other changes. The Delaware State News reports the changes will be made Tuesday after Gov. John Carney’s state of emergency declaration is lifted. Starting Tuesday, mask recommendations will follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Customers who have not been fully vaccinated will be encouraged to continue wearing face coverings while at the DMV. Driver license and vehicle registration suspensions for bad checks will also resume. So will uninsured motorist customer notifications for any outstanding balance owed to the DMV. Class D road tests and counter eye exams are also set to resume. Specific guidance will be in place from the Delaware Division of Public Health to protect both customers and staff. Marinah Carver, chief of communications for DMV, said staff is to be commended for its service to the public during the pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Drivers who frequent Rock Creek Park’s Beach Drive during late mornings and early afternoons will need to reroute themselves to accommodate an extensive renovation project, WUSA-TV reports. As of Monday, the segment of Beach Drive between Shoreham Drive and Tilden Street Northwest will be closed to traffic daily between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to D.C.’s Department of Transportation. The closures will remain in effect until at least Dec. 20. The detours are part of the city’s larger 3.7-mile renovation project that will consolidate the existing paths into part of the Rock Creek Park Multi-Use Trail and Pedestrian Bridge project. This includes the addition of a 110-foot bridge south of the Smithsonian National Zoo tunnel that will reroute foot and bike traffic off the existing narrow footpath that flows directly adjacent to traffic inside the current tunnel. DDOT expects the entire trail renovation to be completed sometime in spring 2023. The rehabilitation process comes nearly three years after a trail adjacent to the National Zoo collapsed following extreme flooding. Foot and bike traffic have subsequently been forced to use the narrow sidewalk in the Beach Drive tunnel.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade County Courthouse will begin undergoing repairs immediately after a review, prompted by the deadly collapse of a nearby condominium building, found that safety concerns exist within the courthouse, officials said. A joint statement from multiple leaders released late Friday said an engineer’s report recommended floors 16 and above be closed to staff at the courthouse. The leaders decided all courthouse employees would go back to working from home. The statement said workers only recently returned to the building after working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Court operations will go back to a remote format until the safety concerns are addressed. People with upcoming court proceedings scheduled to take place in person will be receiving a new notice with instructions, the statement said. Specific details about what repairs are needed were not disclosed. The courthouse was built in 1928 and added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1989, news outlets report. The building has 28 floors. The building underwent a review following the collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, where the toll is likely to top 100.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: A new initiative at the Mercer University School of Medicine conceived by a retired federal judge is helping poor people in rural Georgia erase their medical debt. The Mercer Family Cares Initiative, funded by three families with ties to the university, is retiring more than $4.3 million in medical debt for nearly 3,000 people who live in 33 Georgia counties, according to a news release from the university. The idea came from retired U.S. District Judge William Duffey, who served in the northern district of Georgia and was previously a partner at King & Spalding law firm in Atlanta, after he noticed inflated prices for items on his own medical bills. He did some research and found that the system is needlessly confusing and fraught with undue and unreasonable expenses, particularly for those who are least able to pay. “I’ve always wondered how people navigate the system, especially those who didn’t have the patience, time or resources,” Duffey said in the news release. Mercer’s medical school works on issues related to access to medical care in rural Georgia, and Duffey reached out to two friends who had graduated from Mercer Law, one a current university trustee and one a former trustee, to see about helping to resolve medical debt for people living in poverty.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A nonprofit organization that serves and advocates for the Micronesian and Pacific islander communities plans to open a youth center in Honolulu this month. The center will offer college and career prep, cultural exhibitions, mentorship programs and study areas, We Are Oceania CEO Josie Howard told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. It will have resources for homeless youth and families, she said. “Just like a home means everything to a family, this center will be the same,” Howard said. “It’s a place where they can come and seek help. Somebody is there to help, and somebody is there who understands them.” The Youth Empowerment Center, the first of its kind for We Are Oceania, is located inside a former American Savings Bank branch in Liliha that offered the space to the nonprofit rent-free. University of Hawaii at Manoa undergraduate K-nard Narruhn, who is Chuukese, is recruiting youth mentors and said he is excited to continue working as one himself. The 22-year-old who helps organize and run food drives, vaccination clinics, translation services, and unemployment and housing support remembers getting help from We Are Oceania after he dropped out of high school and was going from job to job feeling unfulfilled. Narruhn earned his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in college, making the dean’s list.\n\nIdaho\n\nBuhl: A far-right extremist group whose members took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol participated with a float in the town’s July 3 parade. The Times-News reports Proud Boys members were among about 100 floats in the Sagebrush Days parade. The Buhl Chamber of Commerce runs the parade but wouldn’t comment specifically about the Proud Boys taking part. “At this time the Buhl Chamber (of) Commerce will not feed into any negative propaganda,” the group said in a statement to the newspaper. “The Buhl 2021 Sagebrush Days parade saw 90 plus entries who celebrated in a courteous and civil manner.” Chamber officials later told the paper they were looking into the process for reviewing parade entries. On Jan. 6, the Proud Boys marched to the Capitol before then-President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. The insurrectionists who descended on the Capitol sent terrified lawmakers running for their lives. Twin Falls County, where Buhl is located, overwhelmingly voted for Trump. In Buhl, men accompanying the Proud Boys float wore black and yellow shirts while carrying an American flag and a black flag with the yellow letters “P.B.” “I was surprised as anyone else to see that particular float go by,” said Buhl City Councilman Michael Higbee. Idaho has a history of far-right groups. The neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations was based near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho starting in the 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: A Southern Illinois University researcher is tracking coyotes and bobcats to understand the habitats they seek and how they affect them. Nicole Gorman, a graduate zoology student and a research assistant at SIU’s Wildlife Research Laboratory in Carbondale, is studying the movement of bobcats and coyotes in central and southern Illinois. Such midsize predators dominate North America, and it’s critical to understand their impact, she said. “Studying predator movement specifically can provide scientists with more details about their behavior and how they might be interacting with their environments and other species around them,” Gorman said. “This understanding can lead to effective wildlife management, benefiting predator and prey species alike.” Since starting in November 2019, Gorman has captured and tagged 33 of the animals at sites near Makanda and Lake Shelbyville. She said she traps them safely with foothold or cage traps and fits them with GPS transmitters to follow them. She studies the incoming data to determine habitats they like and those they avoid. She also reviews their interaction with deer as part of a project on white-tailed deer movement sponsored by the U.S. Wildlife Restoration Fund and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. She’s found coyotes and bobcats in heavily forested southern Illinois need not travel far to sustain themselves, but in the more agricultural central Illinois, their range can exceed 200 square miles.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of abortions performed in the state grew slightly last year, with a new report showing drug-induced abortions made up a majority of the procedures for the first time. The annual report from the state health department shows that the number of abortions in Indiana grew by 119, or 1.6%, to 7,756 during 2020. That increased number remained below the some 8,000 performed in 2018, Indiana’s highest total since 2014. Drug-induced abortions represented 55% of Indiana’s total, up from 44% during 2019 and about double the state’s rate from 2016. Indiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law this year aimed at requiring doctors to tell women undergoing such abortions about a disputed “abortion reversal” treatment for potentially stopping the process. That law, however, was blocked by a federal judge just before it was set to take effect July 1. Indiana recorded about 79,000 live births last year. Indiana Right to Life President Mike Fichter blamed the abortion increase on several anti-abortion laws passed by state legislators being blocked by federal courts. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Nicole Erwin said the COVID-19 pandemic added pressure to many women facing unintended pregnancies, and making contraception more accessible and affordable was the best way to reduce such pregnancies.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Efforts to reduce overcrowding in the state’s prisons have been continued into a second year after beginning in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new data from the state. As of June 14, Iowa’s prison population was 7,744 people, the Legislative Service Agency reported. That’s an increase of only 52 people compared to the previous year, a change of less than 1%. In comparison, there were nearly 9,000 people in the state’s prisons in 2011. Since then, 2014 was the last time fewer than 8,000 Iowans were in state prison at the end of the fiscal year. The current numbers mean about 245 out of each 100,000 Iowans are behind bars. The number was last that low in the late 1990s, according to a report from the Prison Policy Initiative. The Legislative Service Agency’s report uses data from the Iowa Department of Corrections and compares Iowa’s prison population, including admissions and releases, in the 2020 and 2021 budget years. The Legislative Service Agency attributed some of the decline in Iowa’s prison population, admissions and releases to COVID-19 mitigation policies. The Iowa Department of Corrections worked with the Iowa Board of Parole and community-based corrections to transition “as many inmates as possible” to community supervision to reduce prison populations, according to the report.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health officials are investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 cases at a summer camp in Butler County, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced last week. Thirteen cases were reported in the past two weeks and 23 cases overall at the AGK Ministries summer camp at the Wheat State Retreat Center near Maize held June 21-25, the KDHE reports. State and Butler County health officials are investigating and urging anyone who attended the camp to be tested for the coronavirus. The camp is one of four camps listed by the state Thursday as COVID-19 cluster locations based on cases in the prior 14 days. The others are Christ the King Summer Camp and Early Education Center in Topeka, with nine cases; Moana Camp in Overland Park, with five cases; and West Central Christian Service Camp in the Johnson County town of Missouri, with seven cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A federal appeals court has ruled the state Department of Corrections can deny a life-saving medication for inmates with hepatitis C because it is expensive – a decision a dissenting judge said will condemn hundreds of prisoners to long-term organ damage and suffering. In a 2-1 ruling, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said last Tuesday that the department can deny the treatment, which cures nearly 100% of patients but costs $13,000 to $32,000. The majority found that denying it to most of Kentucky’s 1,200 inmates with hepatitis C does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. But in a sharply worded dissent, Judge Jane Stranch of Nashville said by “flouting the recognized standard of care,” the Corrections Department “consigns thousands of prisoners with symptomatic, chronic HCV to years of additional suffering and irreversible liver scarring.” She said by withholding medical treatment until the damage has progressed too far to be reversible, Kentucky’s rationing plan “shocks the conscience” and is fundamentally unfair. Louisville attorney Greg Belzley, who represents prisoners in a class-action lawsuit, called the decision “horrendous” and said they would ask for a rehearing or petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Edwin Washington Edwards, the high-living, quick-witted four-term governor who reshaped the state’s oil revenues and dominated its politics for decades in a run all but overshadowed by scandal and eight years in federal prison, died Monday. He was 93. Edwards died of respiratory problems with family and friends by his bedside, family spokesman Leo Honeycutt said, days after entering hospice care at his home in Gonzales. “I’ve made no bones that I have considered myself on borrowed time for 20 years and we each know that all this fun has to end at some point,” Edwards said days before he died, according to his family’s statement. The “Cajun King” was known for delivering a steady supply of memorable one-liners as well as for his deft political instincts. Infamously, the lifelong Democrat said once said that the only way he could lose to a particularly lackluster Republican was if he were “caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.” A native of Louisiana’s Acadiana region who swore his 1972 oath of office in French and English, Edwards enjoyed renewed popularity after emerging from prison in 2011 at age 83 with his flamboyant character intact. The federal case that led to his May 2000 conviction involved him taking payoffs from interests seeking riverboat casino licenses.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Endangered Atlantic salmon in the Kennebec River can be protected without removing four hydroelectric dams, federal energy regulators said, leaving conservation groups stunned. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reached the conclusion in a draft environmental assessment July 1 in the relicensing of one of four dams owned by the Canada-based Brookfield Renewables. The regulators said the fish can be protected and brought back to a population of at least 2,000, even if the Shawmut Dam in Benton injures or kills as many as 4% of them. That’s a lower bar than both conservationists and Maine’s Department of Marine Resources have called for. “It’s really bad. It’s incredibly bad,” said Nick Bennett, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, told Maine Public. FERC assessment also failed to meet fish passage standards recommended by its sister agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, he said. “Both National Marine Services and the Department of Marine Resources recommended dam removal. FERC completely ignored that,” he said. In a statement, a Brookfield spokesman said FERC’s proposed conditions are consistent with most of the company’s own recommendations, including the completion of a fish-lift at the Shawmut dam.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A software glitch in some parking kiosks may have cost the city as much as $20,000 in revenue. Flowbird, which runs kiosks in downtown Ocean City, had performed a software update July 1 that led to some customers being charged multiple times, Ocean City spokeswoman Jessica Waters said. When city officials learned of the problem, they shut down paid parking July 5-6. Waters said that resulted in a revenue loss that has been estimated to be as much as $20,000. The problem also affected other communities with Flowbird kiosks, including Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. Flowbird has since resolved the problem and is issuing refunds, Vice President of Marketing Sean Renn said. He said that there were no security violations or hacks and that all customer data is safe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The U.S.S. Constitution is returning to its full summer visitation hours this week for the first time in more than a year. Starting Tuesday, the warship known as “Old Ironsides” will be open for free public tours from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. The ship suspended public visits in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic but reopened on a limited basis last August. After a second shutdown, it reopened with limited visitation hours in May. Visitors are allowed to freely explore the top three decks of Old Ironsides and hear active-duty Navy sailors explain the ship’s 223-year history. The ship welcomed more than 600,000 guests in 2019. The U.S.S. Constitution is the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat. It played a crucial role in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812, actively defending sea lanes from 1797 until 1855. The ship was undefeated in battle and destroyed or captured 33 enemy vessels. It earned its nickname during the War of 1812 when British cannonballs bounced off its wooden hull.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans’ attempts to add an ID component to absentee ballot applications and to institute signature verification at polling places have died in the GOP-led Legislature, amid pushback from election clerks and voting-rights advocates. Rep. Ann Bollin, who chairs the House Elections and Ethics Committee, said she and many other House Republicans oppose a Senate-passed bill that would require absentee ballot applicants to include a copy of their photo ID, their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Those who do not would get a provisional ballot and have to either verify their voter registration or their identity and residence within six days after the election for it to count. “There was not support to make it more difficult for voters through the AV process,” said Bollin, of Brighton Township. Nearly 3.3 million people – a record – voted absentee in November. Voters currently seeking an absentee ballot by mail must sign the application, and the signature is matched to the voter file. The Senate, meanwhile, is poised as soon as this week to reject the House GOP’s proposal to require that in-person voters’ signatures be verified before they are given a ballot, by mandating that signatures in Michigan’s voter file be added to electronic poll books.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: One of the state’s oddest, perhaps coolest and definitely most historically underappreciated fish – the gar – is about to get some love. The long, slender, toothy and prehistoric-looking fish will, for the first time ever in Minnesota, be protected in ways similar to other gamefish, the result of a bit of an outcry on social media following a series of mass killings that some saw as wantonly wasteful. In a Legislature divided starkly along partisan lines, Minnesota’s gar species found bipartisan support. Officials say they aren’t sure exactly what restrictions they’ll place on catching and killing gar, but the move carries a growing awareness of changing attitudes toward native fish that humbly live on the opposite end of the piscatorial spectrum from celebrated fish like walleye and bass, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. The much larger environment and natural resources bill approved by both the House and Senate contains one brief reference to gar: “The commissioner must annually establish daily and possession limits for gar.” Most states, including Minnesota, consider any gar, which are native to North America, as a “rough fish” with no limits for how many can be killed, of any size, any time of year. Two species of gars are native to Minnesota, the longnose gar and shortnose gar.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which examines all fatal shootings by police officers across the state, has typically denied requests to release video footage and other evidence. But the commissioner of public safety told the Sun Herald the agency is changing its approach to allow for greater transparency. Sean Tindell, a former state senator and a former judge who became commissioner in June 2020, said he has directed the Department of Public Safety, which includes MBI, to be more responsive to public records requests. In June, the agency released video footage and some investigative material from its investigation of a Harrison County deputy’s shooting of Reginald Johnson outside the Biloxi courthouse in January. “As more and more of these incidents of officer-involved shootings are shared with the public in other parts of the country, I believe we need to be more transparent here in Mississippi as well,” Tindell said. “I’ve always been a big believer in transparency. I believe that if you … maintain a cloak of secrecy, then it lends itself to conspiracy theories and incorrect assumptions. I believe the public should have a right to view the footage and understand exactly what happened.” Tindell said his guidance for transparency applies to all agencies under his department.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Five police officers facing criminal charges remain on the job, with four on administrative duty and one still on patrol. Community leaders who have been critical of the Kansas City Police Department say they are particularly angry that a detective charged with manslaughter, Eric DeValkenaere, remains on administrative duty and is being paid, according to the Kansas City Star. “I think it’s despicable,” said Randy Fikki, senior pastor of Unity Southeast, who led several Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. Police spokeswoman Capt. Leslie Foreman said the department’s policies give supervisors discretion to determine whether to suspend officers and whether that suspension should be paid or unpaid. That is despite a separate policy that says officers charged with a crime related to their use of a department firearm will be suspended, which would apply to DeValkenaere, who is charged in the 2019 shooting of Cameron Lamb in Lamb’s backyard following a traffic incident. Officials said that policy requiring suspension when an officer’s gun is used is under review. DeValkenaere was suspended with pay after the shooting but returned to work in January. He is the only one charged in an incident involving a gun.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A subsidiary of the company that owns the Yellowstone Club bought an 18,000-acre ranch at the foot of the Crazy Mountains east of Clyde Park and said it has no plans to develop or change the property. The Lone Mountain Land Company announced the purchase of the Crazy Mountain Ranch last week, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The company said in an announcement that it doesn’t intend to develop residential subdivisions or a commercial heliskiing operation on the property. “Lone Mountain Land Company will continue to operate the ranch’s cow-calf operation and guest ranch,” Sam Byrne, managing partner and co-founder at CrossHarbor Capital Partners, said in a release. “We look forward to working with our neighbors, the Clyde Park community, and the Forest Service to be thoughtful stewards of the land and good members of the community.” The potential of residential developments and a heliskiing operation had caused a measure of public concern ahead of the sale, said Erica Lighthiser, deputy director with the Park County Environmental Council and member of the Crazy Mountain Access Project. That portion of Park County isn’t zoned, Lighthiser said, leaving any future developments to the sole discretion of the new owners.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Storms that knocked down trees and power lines across eastern Nebraska over the weekend left more people without electricity than any area storm in years. The Omaha Public Power District said with 188,000 customers losing power after the storms Friday night and early Saturday, it was a larger outage than any storm since June 2008, when 156,000 customers lost electricity. By midday Sunday, fewer than 60,000 OPPD customers remained without power, but utility officials said it could take several days to restore electricity to everyone, according to the Omaha World-Herald. By comparison, the historic snowstorm that pummeled Omaha in October 1997 left 150,000 in the dark. More recently, a Father’s Day tornado in 2017 left about 75,000 customers without power. The utility set another record after this weekend’s storm. Spokeswoman Laura King-Homan said OPPD deployed more workers in the field than ever before when 539 crew members were out Saturday working to restore power.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Driver’s licenses and identification cards are getting a new look and upgraded security features, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday. DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said the agency began rolling out cards at a busy Las Vegas office, and the Reno office is due to begin offering the cards Wednesday. By next month, all 18 DMV offices around the state should have upgraded camera equipment to produce the new cards. They represent the first redesign since 2008, although some modifications were made in 2014. DMV Director Julie Butler said in a statement the new licenses and ID cards have enhanced security features that help protect Nevadans against identity theft and aid law enforcement agencies. Malone said the state currently has more than 2.2 million licensed drivers. The officials said existing licenses and ID cards will remain valid until they expire. Customers will receive the new design at renewal or during other transactions such as a name or address change. Card production fees will remain $3.25, Malone said. Nevada’s “Battle Born” insignia is featured on the front of the license in addition to the year of statehood, 1864.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: An island garden that once inspired one of America’s foremost impressionist painters has been reconstructed on the mainland for a second summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the late 1880s, poet Celia Thaxter attracted members of Boston’s literary and artistic societies to her family’s hotel on Appledore Island off the coast of Portsmouth. Artist Childe Hassam kept a studio there and featured Thaxter’s gardens in a series of paintings. The island is now home to the Shoals Marine Laboratory, and hundreds of people visit a recreation of the garden each summer. But the tours have been canceled again this year because of the pandemic. Instead, the garden has been recreated at Prescott Park in Portsmouth. Free guided tours are scheduled for July 16 and 30 and Aug. 6.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state on Monday unveiled a phone app that lets people keep track of their COVID-19 vaccination card digitally. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced the app called Docket during a news conference in Trenton. He said it’s not meant to serve as a passport and instead will serve as a backup in case people lose their paper vaccination cards. It’s unclear what the app cost the state to develop, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. She said officials plan to begin allowing people to use the app to track other vaccinations they have, but for now it works just for COVID-19 vaccines. The app is available through Apple and Google Play app stores, the governor said. “To be absolutely clear, this is not a ‘passport,’ ” Murphy said. “Docket is intended solely to give residents easy access to their COVID vaccination record, especially if their vaccination card has been damaged or lost.” Murphy has been reluctant to embrace the idea of vaccine passport, proof of vaccination, in order to enter certain places or take part in certain activities. On Monday, he said he wants to see more vaccine “equity,” particular among African American residents. Objections to passports revolve in part around privacy and security, including how people’s personal information will be stored, and fairness.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The University of New Mexico will continue to encourage that students, faculty and staff get vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus in August for the fall semester but no longer plans to require it. University President Garnett Stokes said in a campuswide email that vaccinations are key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus and that the university is working toward a 100% vaccination rate. However, the vaccine remains under emergency use authorization by the federal government, the university noted in a statement Thursday. The school previously proposed a vaccine requirement and posted a draft policy on its website. “After more than a year of mostly remote learning and working, mask mandates and testing,” the university community views its approaching full return to campus “with a sense of optimism and renewed purpose,” the statement issued Thursday said. UNM officials still urge those who are not vaccinated to continue to wear a mask, the statement said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A sinkhole on a Manhattan street collapsed under two parked cars Sunday, prompting renewed criticism of the city’s infrastructure several days after heavy rains caused severe subway flooding. There were no injuries reported after the sinkhole on the Upper West Side left an SUV with its back end stuck and the car behind it tilting forward. “But this yet another reminder: NYC simply must invest more in upgrading our outdated infrastructure,” New York City Council member Mark Levine said on Twitter. Levine posted pictures of the vehicles on Riverside Drive days after widely circulated videos showed water pouring into subway stations following heavy rain Thursday. The vehicles had been removed by Sunday afternoon.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man who served 26 years in prison for a murder he said he didn’t commit is still seeking a pardon and compensation. Dontae Sharpe told The Raleigh News & Observer on Friday that he wants to be able to support a family that includes his daughter and two grandchildren. He said he also wants to help out his mother after she spent her savings sending him money in prison and trying to prove his innocence. “The monetary part, that was the most difficult part of being released,” Sharpe said. Sharpe was 19 when he was sent to prison for the 1994 murder of 33-year-old George Radcliffe. He maintained his innocence throughout, and the NAACP argued for his release for years. He was released from a Pitt County courtroom in 2019 when a judge ordered a new trial at the end of a hearing. The prosecutor then said she wouldn’t pursue a retrial. Theresa Newman, a lawyer who represented Sharpe and a professor emerita at the Duke University Law School, said that a person who receives a pardon can apply to the state for monetary compensation. It has a cap of $750,000.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A petition backs the idea of a ban on undocumented immigrants and refugees and the notion of declaring Ward County a Second Amendment “gun sanctuary.” Language on the resolution led by county resident Nicole Engberg offers support “to ban sanctuary cities, illegal immigrants, aliens, refugees in Ward County, North Dakota, and add Ward County, North Dakota, as a Second Amendment gun sanctuary county.” Egeberg said the immigration issue on the southern border is relevant to the county. Undocumented immigrants stress the local law enforcement system, schools and tax dollars, she said at a county commission meeting. “They have no respect for our laws, no respect for our border, and it causes pressure. We have drug trafficking, human trafficking, sex trafficking, amongst many other things,” Engberg said. “We want them removed. We don’t want them brought here illegally. If they want to come here legally, appropriately vetted, they are more than welcome here in the county.” Enberg said about 5,000 people had signed the petition, the Minot Daily News reports. The commission did not object to banning illegal immigration and supporting gun rights, which members pointed out are current law. But commissioners sought more specific resolution language than was included in petitions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Wind and solar companies hoping to do business in the state will face an additional hurdle, thanks to a bill Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Monday. Under Senate Bill 52, county commissioners could reject particular wind turbines or solar farms, ban the projects entirely, or carve out portions of the county where those facilities couldn’t be built. The change, which takes effect in 90 days, adds a step for solar and wind companies that their coal and natural gas competitors don’t face. But lawmakers who introduced the bill say companies need to involve local residents – not just a little-known Ohio Power Siting Board – to succeed. Under the new law, project developers must notify county commissioners and trustees at least 90 days before filing with the power siting board. The proposal also adds a commissioner and trustee to the board while it reviews the local project. Opponents of the bill say it singles out renewable energy for unnecessary restrictions. Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers enacted a law to prevent municipalities from banning natural gas in new construction projects and saved subsidies for the owner of two coal plants. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and local development arms opposed the changes because they want to encourage renewable energy projects in the state, which can attract other business activity.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Public school teachers could have their teaching licenses suspended for teaching certain concepts about race and racism under new rules approved Monday by the State Board of Education. With just one opposing vote, the board approved emergency rules to comply with a bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that purports to ban so-called critical race theory. The new law prohibits public school teachers of grades K-12 from teaching eight different concepts about race, including that an individual, by virtue of race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. It also prohibits teaching that any individual should feel discomfort or guilt on account of their race or sex. The Republican authors of the bill said it targeted critical race theory, which is a way of thinking about America’s history through the lens of racism, although there is no mention in the bill of critical race theory, which is not typically taught in K-12 schools. Democrats in the Legislature who opposed the bill argued it was a waste of time and addressed a nonexistent problem. Carlisha Bradley, the only Black member of the board, voted against adopting the rules, saying she believes the new law and the rules are doing a disservice to students and teachers.\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Sheriff’s deputies in southern Oregon may start arresting people who refuse to heed evacuation orders issued because of a large, growing wildfire that threatens two small towns. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the wildfire grew to about 231 square miles by Sunday afternoon. The blaze, burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest and on private land north of Sprague River and Beatty, about 290 miles southeast of Portland, was 0% contained. Fire managers on Sunday extended a Level 3 evacuation zone to unincorporated Beatty, with a population of about 120 people. Level 3 evacuations mean residents must leave immediately. Deputies continued to circle the area to ensure people were contacted, said Stacey Todd, a spokesperson for Klamath County Emergency Management. She couldn’t recall a time the sheriff’s office warned of citations or arrests for failing to evacuate during a wildfire.“I think the message has gotten out that this is a very serious fire that is unpredictable and is very high-risk to the area,” Todd said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s Department of Health has reduced the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered by about 500,000, saying the numbers were duplicates. The figures, released Friday evening without explanation, also showed an increase of about 60,000 in the number of people counted as fully vaccinated. The numbers include 66 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. They do not include Philadelphia, which is its own vaccine jurisdiction. For all 67 counties, the percentage of people 18 and over who are vaccinated was 61%, up slightly with the change in data. Asked about the changed figures, a Department of Health spokesperson said agency staff had been working to link both first and second doses to individual residents. As a result, they were removing duplicated data that resulted from providers using software that did not include a unique patient identifier or uploading duplicate data, or from people getting first and second doses from different providers. The data now more accurately reflects the number of people who have received the first of a two-dose vaccine, the spokesperson said. Friday’s data showed just under 11.3 million total vaccine doses, down from Thursday’s figure of 11.8 million. It also showed over 5.5 million people fully vaccinated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has officially banned the release of large numbers of balloons in a move to protect wildlife. Under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Dan McKee, the state will prohibit anyone from intentionally releasing 10 or more helium or other lighter-than-air balloons outdoors. Supporters say balloon releases are an environmental nuisance and pose a serious threat to birds, marine animals and other wildlife that ingest or become entangled in balloon litter. Violators face a fine of $100 when the new rule takes effect in November. The new law won’t affect hot air balloons, indoor balloon releases, or scientific and weather research.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is asking for public input on whether state-leased Wildlife Management Areas should be open for hunting on Sundays. The Department of Natural Resources has an online survey up until July 28 as well as four public hearings planned across the state over the next two weeks. The 1.2 million acres public land in South Carolina are also used for fishing, hiking, bird-watching and other ways to observe nature. Hunters can use the public land during season, but state law only allows hunting on Sundays on private land. The first of four public hearings on the hunting changes is set for Tuesday at the Clemson Pee Dee Research and Education Center in Florence. There is a meeting Thursday at the Clinton National Guard Armory, on July 19 at the Santee Cooper Auditorium in Moncks Corner, and July 26 at a site that hasn’t been determined in Columbia. All the meetings start at 6 p.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: As federal officials debate investing billions of dollars in broadband access, the state is planning to invest $100million as it struggles to extend reliable internet service to every corner of the state. Data suggests many South Dakota schoolchildren and adults who worked from home during the pandemic struggled with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s poorest and least populated counties. Advocates say the “digital divide” across South Dakota and the rest of the U.S. is due largely to two factors: a lack of internet infrastructure in rural areas and relatively high costs that have made broadband unaffordable for many in urban centers. In about half of South Dakota’s counties – 34 of 66 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 88% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 33 of 65 counties – no more than 28% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. That helps explain why the Legislature and Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this year set aside $100 million, mostly federal pandemic relief money, to help the telecommunications industry build fiber lines and antenna towers in rural areas.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A federal judge in the state has joined other judges in blocking a Biden administration program designed to redress generations of discrimination against some farmers, saying the federal government has failed to show the U.S. Department of Agriculture discriminates against people of color today. Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Anderson issued a national injunction that bars the Biden administration from enacting the loan forgiveness plan approved by Congress in March as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. The injunction is the third to result from litigation filed in seven states, including Tennessee, on behalf of white farmers in the past month, according to court records. The administration said it chose to funnel relief to qualifying farmers because of the USDA’s “long history” of discriminating against Black farmers and the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on minorities. White farmers, including Tennessee rancher Rob Holman, are calling it “reverse racism” in litigation filed by conservative legal advocacy groups, including the Southeastern Legal Foundation and Mountain States Legal Foundation. Anderson agreed in his ruling.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrats in the Legislature on Monday began bolting for Washington, D.C., and said they were ready to remain there for weeks in a second revolt against a GOP overhaul of election laws, forcing a dramatic new showdown over voting rights in America. One large group was set to leave Austin on private planes before the GOP could pass a voting bill in a special legislative session ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that began days ago. It was not immediately clear how many of the 67 Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives planned to go, but it was expected to be enough to bring the Legislature to a halt. “This is a now-or-never for our democracy. We are holding the line in Texas,” said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “We’ve left our jobs; we’ve left our families; we’ve left our homes. Because there is nothing more important than voting rights in America.” By leaving, Democrats would again deny the GOP majority a quorum to pass bills, barely a month after their walkout thwarted the first push for sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, including outlawing 24-hour polling places, banning ballot drop boxes and empowering partisan poll watchers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Water managers in the bone-dry state reported last week that 98% of Utah was in extreme or exceptional levels of drought. The state was already 10 inches of precipitation below the “normal” amount expected in a given water year, making it extremely unlikely it would reach its usual count of 27 inches during an average water year, according to the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “Utah’s precipitation is down about 38% this year compared to an average year. It’s extremely unlikely we can make up that deficit between now and the end of the watering year on Sept. 30,” said Brian Stee, executive director of the Utah DNR. “When we consider future patterns, we should not expect an immediate recovery from this extreme drought. We anticipate it will take time, possibly years, to climb out.” In southwestern Utah, water managers had only measured 41% of the precipitation normally expected by this point in the water year. Drought maps produced by the U.S. Drought Monitor showed small pockets of northern Utah were the only places in the state not already at the two worst levels of drought as measured by federal climate criteria, with the entire southwestern section of the state rated as being in “exceptional” drought, the worst category.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: About 40 homeless people who had been scheduled to lose their pandemic-related emergency hotel rooms in the state on July 1 are seeking to be verified as having a disability, allowing them to stay longer. Late last month, a federal court judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for two weeks for some people to show they can remain eligible. That came after Vermont Legal Aid sued the state, alleging the changes violate state law and have a restrictive definition of what qualifies as a disability. About 700 people were expected to lose their hotel rooms at the beginning of the month. The state has extended the hotel voucher program 84 days for families with children, the disabled, pregnant women and other vulnerable people, and it gave $2,500 checks to those no longer eligible. Families with children and some disabled households may be able to stay longer. So far, 37 people who were no longer eligible July 1 have attested that they have a disability while they work to get paperwork from a medical provider, Nicole Tousignant of the Vermont Department for Children and Families said Monday. Vermont spent $79 million on the hotel vouchers program, housing up to 2,000 households on some nights, but the program is not financially sustainable, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: A conservative group is asking a court to temporarily prohibit Virginia Tech from enforcing some of its policies against harassment and discrimination. The Roanoke Times reports the group, called Speech First Inc., has already filed a lawsuit on behalf of three students against the school’s anti-bias policies. Now the group wants a federal judge to temporarily prevent the university from enforcing the policies until he rules on the lawsuit. The group contends that the students hold views that are unpopular on a campus of roughly 35,000 students. Those views include opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement as well as same-sex marriage and abortion. The lawsuit claims Virginia Tech’s policies are overly vague because they forbid “telling unwelcome jokes about someone’s identity” and urging “religious beliefs on someone who finds it unwelcome.” The school has revised one of its policies by clarifying that a ban on speech for “partisan and political purposes” applies only to employees. But Virginia Tech is defending the rest and urged the judge not to grant the group’s request for a preliminary injunction. “It cannot be that Virginia Tech is essentially prohibited in the face of the First Amendment” from having anti-harassment policies, said counsel to the Attorney General Jessica Samuels, who represents university President Tim Sands.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: One day after an investigation found that two of six Seattle police officers violated the law while in Washington, D.C., during the Jan. 6 insurrection, lawyers representing the officers in a related public records case filed a motion to withdraw from that case. The six officers had filed a lawsuit in February against a list of people who had filed public records requests seeking the officers’ identities and information about the investigation by the Office of Police Accountability into their activities while in the nation’s capital. After a judge ordered the release of their identities in March, the officers appealed. Sam Sueoka, a Seattle University law student who was named in the officers’ lawsuit, has asked the Washington Supreme Court to decide the issue. The court will consider that request at the end of July. On Thursday, the OPA released a report on its investigation. It found that at least two of the officers had violated the law and department policy by trespassing at the U.S. Capitol while rioters stormed the building. OPA Director Andrew Myerberg recommended that the two officers be fired. On Friday, the officers’ three lawyers, Kelly Sheridan, Victoria Ainsworth and Kayla Higgins, filed a motion stating their intent to leave the public records case. They did not give a reason but said withdrawal would be effective July 19.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: Federal regulators have joined state officials in reviewing lead service lines in the city for elevated levels of the toxin in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will assist the state Department of Health and Human Resources and the Clarksburg Water System in the review, which was announced July 2, the DHHR said in a news release. Sampling in several homes showed lead levels above a limit set by the EPA. Lead lines were phased out in the 1950s, and it’s unlikely homes built after 1960 would have them. The DHHR is encouraging residents of homes built before 1950 to use bottled water for consumption and have children younger than age 6 evaluated for lead, Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said in the statement. The issue of lead service lines was first identified by Bureau for Public Health staff during assessments conducted in the homes of children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Devil’s Lake State Park, Wisconsin’s most-visited park, is set to get larger. The Wisconsin Natural Resources Board has unanimously approved purchasing a 220-acre property for $1.64 million to add onto the park, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. “It is truly a great potential addition to Devil’s Lake State Park,” Jim Lemke, real estate section chief at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told the board. “The land is very useful. It’s beautifully wooded with mature hardwoods and has potential of many different opportunities for public use.” The parcel is located on the southwestern edge of the park and could be used for hunting and wildlife watching. It could also be developed into hiking and mountain biking trails, according to a memo on the proposed purchase. The money to purchase the land would come from the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, which the state uses to purchase new land for parks and recreation areas. Located outside Baraboo and 45 minutes north of Madison, the approximately 9,200-acre Devil’s Lake was created in 1911 and is the third-oldest state park. There were 2.1 million visitors to Devil’s Lake last year, making it Wisconsin’s most popular park.\n\nWyoming\n\nGlenrock: The community is jumping at the chance for a company to build an experimental power source on the edge of town. Before the end of the year, developers of a new type of nuclear power plant will decide which of four Wyoming towns will house their project, and Glenrock wants to be selected, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. During a Wednesday meeting with the heads of TerraPower and Rocky Mountain Power, community leaders listened attentively to the companies’ pitch. Most were already on board with the project. A few safety questions did come up, but Glenrock’s leaders wanted to focus the conversation on logistics – not risk. The town’s coal-fired power plant, Dave Johnston, is set to retire in 2027, taking 191 jobs with it. The Natrium reactor is scheduled to come online the following year, generating an estimated 250 permanent jobs. Its developers intend to establish training programs to help workers in the selected community transition from their current jobs at the coal plant to new roles at the nuclear facility. Glenrock is a town of just 2,600 people; Converse County’s entire population numbers fewer than 14,000. The community’s history is intertwined with that of the energy sector. Many see the nuclear plant not only as a natural transition but a necessary one for their economic survival.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/27/corrections-clarifications-2017/3031456001/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2017", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

And consequently, millions are breathing polluted air that does not satisfy WHO health standards, according to the report that analyzed real-time air quality of 6,475 cities.\n\nOnly 222 cities have the average air quality that met WHO's standard, according to the study conducted by IQAir, a Swiss pollution technology company that monitors air quality.\n\nThe data was collected by tens of thousands of ground-level regulatory air quality monitoring stations operated by governments, non-profit organizations, research institutions, educational facilities, companies and citizen scientists around the world.\n\nThe WHO's standard is that average annual readings of hazardous airborne particles (PM2.5) not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nAir pollution is considered the largest environmental threat, leading to 7 million deaths per year and other respiratory problems such as asthma and lung cancer, the report stated.

Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.\n\nIn the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\n\n“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”\n\nIQAir\n\nAbove: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.\n\nIt’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nPM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nMillions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.\n\nIQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.\n\nIn the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.\n\n“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.\n\nResearchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”\n\nClimate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.\n\nChina — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.\n\nThe report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.\n\n“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.\n\nThe report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.\n\n“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.\n\nHammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.\n\nTarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\n\n“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.\n\nHammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\n\n“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy.

Studies have demonstrated that “even with moderate to aggressive climate change regulation in terms of targeting greenhouse gases, we are going to see a higher occurrence of wildfires” and “they will be both more common and more intense”, she said.\n\nA study last year found that “virtually every home in the UK is subjected to air pollution above World Health Organization guidelines”, The Guardian’s environment editor Damian Carrington reported.

The report, which was prepared in 2014 by the World Health Organization, looked at outdoor air pollution in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries.\n\nBy way of comparison, Los Angeles was at 20 and New York City at 14. The problem in Beijing is that while its overall average may not be catastrophic, when the smog gets bad it can be really dreadful, as evidenced by the current air quality reading of 200.\n\nThe great majority of cities worldwide exceed WHO's air quality guidelines.\n\nChina issues first-ever red alert on air pollution\n\nGlobally, relatively few of the monitored cities currently meet the WHO guideline values, the WHO said. These tend to be clustered in high-income countries. Air quality is poorest in the eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asian regions, followed by Latin America and Africa.\n\nOnly 12% of the people living in cities reporting on air quality live in cities that meet with WHO guideline levels, the report said.\n\nA list of the world cities with highest pollution levels:\n\nRank, city, country, pollution level\n\n1 Delhi, India 153\n\n2 Patna, India 149\n\n3 Gwalior, India 144\n\n4 Raipur, India 134\n\n5 Karachi, Pakistan 117\n\n6 Peshawar, Pakistan 111\n\n7 Rawalpindi, Pakistan 107\n\n8 Khormabad, Iran 102\n\n9 Ahmedabad, India 100\n\n10 Lucknow, India 96\n\n11 Firozabad, India 96\n\n12 Doha, Qatar 93\n\n13 Kanpur, India 93\n\n14 Amritsar, India 92\n\n15 Ludhiana, India 91\n\n16 Idgir, Turkey 90\n\n17 Narayonganj, Bangladesh 89\n\n18 Allahbad, India 88\n\n19 Agra, India 88\n\n20 Khanna, India 88\n\nSource: World Health Organization", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/08/22/24-7-wall-st-most-polluted-cities/32130565/", "title": "The most polluted cities in America", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Sam Stebbins and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nMore than 138 million people, nearly 44% of the U.S. population, live in areas where air pollution reaches dangerously high levels during parts of the year. While exposure to low quality air has declined in recent years, some cities still experience alarming levels of pollution.\n\nBased on \"State of the Air,\" a report released annually by the American Lung Association (ALA), 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 leading metro areas with the highest levels of year-round particle pollution. The Fresno-Madera, California metro area led the nation with the worst long-term pollution level.\n\nThe report considers two types of pollution: ozone pollution and particle pollution, which can be measured both in short and long-term. Speaking to 24/7 Wall St. Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of national policy at the ALA, explained the three measures. Ozone is a gas formed in the atmosphere through heat, sunlight, and certain gases that can attack lung tissue. Particle pollution is tiny pieces of matter so small that they can bypass the body's defenses and be inhaled into the lungs. The long-term particulate measure is the average, daily pollution generated by factories, fires, and transportation. Long term particle pollution is measured in micro-grams per cubic meter (ug/M3).The short-term particulate measure represents how many days of extreme air pollution occur, and usually reflects how extreme conditions such as fire or drought are creating abnormally high levels of unhealthy particles.\n\nIn the 2015 report, six cities set local records for the most days with dangerously high levels of particle pollution, including the San Francisco and Visalia, Calif., metropolitan areas. Nolen said these were surprising results. \"We've been doing this report for 16 years, and generally speaking, you'll see a variation in pollution levels from one year to the next, but almost never do you set new records because we've made huge improvements in reducing pollution.\" Nolen went on to explain that these cities, all in the Western United States, had just begun to experience drought conditions — that are still ongoing — when these data were collected from 2011 through 2013. The drought has only worsened since 2013. \"When we get into next year's report and the year after, I think we'll see even higher levels in these areas.\"\n\nSeveral of the most polluted cities, notably Pittsburgh and Cleveland, are former manufacturing and production strongholds. While these areas are no longer the industrial strongholds of their heydays, enough industrial and manufacturing production remains for the cities to maintain their standings among the most polluted places in the country. While Pittsburgh's skies are no longer blackened with the smoke from steel factories, it still generates a great deal of particulate pollution. According to Nolen, the biggest source of pollution in the area is the U.S. Steel plant.\n\nSeveral of the most polluted cities are located in or near the Central Valley in California. In addition to the wildfires and drought that have affected the region, the area's natural topography exacerbates the pollution problem. The Central Valley is surrounded by mountains on three sides, which traps the pollution from the San Francisco Bay Area in the valley. Five of the 10 most polluted cities, including parts of the San Francisco metro area, are in the California Central Valley.\n\nAir pollution, both ozone and particulate, contributes to lower life expectancy. In particular, polluted air poses significant health risks to individuals who already have certain respiratory conditions. While there is no evidence that proves that air pollution is the reason that asthma has increased in prevalence in the last 40 years, Nolen said, air pollution exacerbates the effects of asthma and can be the cause of an asthma attack. In Los Angeles, one of the cities with the worst air pollution in the country, more than 1.6 million residents are living with asthma.\n\nWhile conditions in some cities have worsened, the air quality in many of the cities with the worst air pollution has improved since last year's report. Nolen explained that every five years, the Environmental Protection Agency determines the safe levels of ozone and particle pollution. Cities and communities around the country have to formulate and implement plans to reduce pollution in order to meet national air quality standards set by the EPA. People in cities such as Philadelphia, which reported its lowest levels of annual particle pollution to date in the 2015 report, have the Clean Air Act to thank. Nolen attributed more efficient vehicles, cleaner-burning fuel, cleaner power plants and an overall reduction in emissions and pollution since 1970 to the Clean Air Act.\n\nTo identify the 10 most polluted cities, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the metropolitan statistical areas with the highest levels of year-round particle pollution from the ALA's 2015 \"State of the Air\" report. The number of area residents with asthma, including the number of adults and the number of pediatric cases of the disease, also came from the ALA. The incidence of cardiovascular disease, and the number of residents who have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at some point in their lives also came from the ALA. All estimates of pollution levels are based on three-year annual averages from 2011 through 2013.\n\nThese are America's 10 most polluted cities.\n\n1. Fresno-Madera, Calif.\n\n> Average year-round particle pollution: 18.1 ug/M3\n\n> People with asthma: 96,760\n\n> Population: 1,107,661\n\n> High ozone days per year: 68\n\nAir pollution improved in Fresno-Madera, but the metro area is still the most polluted in the country, as it was in the ALA's 2014 report. As in other parts of California, the statewide, multi-year drought has likely worsened air quality in the area over the past several years. Hot and dry weather can promote dust storms and wildfires, which trap particulates generated by power plants and other carbon emitters. Fresno residents have experienced an average of 68 high-ozone days a year, the sixth highest rate in the country.\n\nMORE:The poorest town in each state\n\n2. Bakersfield, Calif.\n\n> Average year-round particle pollution: 17.3 ug/M3\n\n> People with asthma: 75,406\n\n> Population: 864,124\n\n> High ozone days per year: 69.7\n\nBakersfield residents have endured nearly 70 high-ozone level days a year, the third highest rate compared with other U.S. cities. Still, this was a considerable improvement for the area when compared to years past since the ALA began reporting on air quality. As in other California metro areas, however, particularly those in the state's Central Valley, annual particle pollution worsened last year, partly due to the severe drought conditions in the region. Also, the topography and industrial composition of the Valley is conducive to air pollution problems. Adding to the region's especially poor air quality is pollution generated by cars and trucks travelling through the region's major throughways and the toxic gases from manure on the millions of acres of the area's farmland.\n\nMORE:America's best companies to work for\n\n3. Visalia-Porterville-Hanford, Calif.\n\n> Average year-round particle pollution: 17.0 ug/M3\n\n> People with asthma: 52,749\n\n> Population: 605,103\n\n> High ozone days per year: 82.7\n\nVisalia is located almost directly in between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The city had had an average of nearly 83 high-ozone days a year, the second highest rate in the country. The Visalia metro area was one of six California metros to break the top 10 for ozone pollution, ranking second in the nation despite this year reporting the fewest days of unhealthy ozone levels in its reporting history. On the other hand, the city, like many other Valley cities, experienced its worst year for particulate pollution.\n\nMORE:The least healthy county in each state\n\n4. Modesto-Merced, Calif.\n\n> Average year-round particle pollution: 15.7 ug/M3\n\n> People with asthma: 69,027\n\n> Population: 788,719\n\n> High ozone days per year: 22.3\n\nModesto residents have experienced an average of 22 high ozone days per year. Only seven metro areas in the country had a greater number of high ozone days. Located almost directly in the center of California's Central Valley, an area surrounded on three sides by mountains that limit wind and annual rainfall, polluted air stagnates in Modesto. The city was one of six in the country that failed to meet federal air quality standards and where particle pollution worsened since last year's report. Nearly 70,000 Modesto residents suffer from asthma, and over 25,000 area adults have been diagnosed with COPD.\n\n5. Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif.\n\n> Average year-round particle pollution: 15.1 ug/M3\n\n> People with asthma: 1,607,111\n\n> Population: 18,351,929\n\n> High ozone days per year: 117.7\n\nLos Angeles port's cargo volume this past July was the highest ever in its over 100-year history. According to the EPA, high traffic through the port creates higher emissions that contribute to poor air quality throughout the region. High concentrations of power plants, including numerous oil and gas, petroleum, and electricity plants, release tens of millions of metric tons of carbon emissions each year. While the area is among the nation's most polluted, Los Angeles reported its lowest pollution levels since the ALA started producing this report. Still, in Los Angeles, residents have experienced an average of 117.7 days of high ozone levels each year, the most of any U.S. metropolitan area.\n\n24/7 WALL ST.: The rest of the 10 most polluted U.S. cities\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But the World Health Organization ranks the world's cities based on air pollution, and the worst Chinese city, Xingtai, only ranks ninth in the 2016 list.\n\nWHO's ranking, released in May 2016, is based on the amount of PM 2.5 — particle matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter common to dust, soot and smoke.

The River Wye, on the border of England and Wales, has seen rising levels of algal blooms and declining levels of fish life; its once-clear gravel bottom is now, in many places, coated in green slime.\n\nCampaigners say the River Windrush in Oxfordshire is “literally dying” because of pollution.

Figures published last year by the Environment Agency (EA) revealed that just 14% of English rivers are classed as being in “good ecological health” under the EU’s Water Framework Directive (which has been retained post-Brexit). These were among the worst figures in Europe.\n\nIn Scotland, by contrast, 65.7% of rivers were classed as in good health, and in Wales 64%. For the first time, none of the 4,600 English rivers, lakes and waterways assessed by the EA achieved “good chemical status”.\n\nWhy is it happening?\n\nToxic run-off from cities, oil spills and fly-tipping all contribute to pollution. However, the two main sources are agriculture and water companies. Pesticides, fungicides and fertilisers used in farming, along with animal slurry, all run off the land and into waterways. These have direct toxic effects, as well as creating high levels of phosphates and nitrates in the water, leading to excessive growth of algae – choking river channels and damaging the habitat of other plants, fish and animals.\n\nIn the Wye river catchment area, for instance, it is thought that an increase in the number of intensive chicken farms has led to a damaging increase in the amount of phosphates in the river. More shocking, though, and arguably more easily avoidable, is the dumping of sewage directly in rivers by water companies.\n\nHow big an issue is sewage?\n\nWater companies discharged raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters in England no fewer than 400,000 times last year, according to the EA. Untreated effluent – including human waste, condoms and wet wipes – poured into rivers and seas for a total of 3.1 million hours via sewage overflow pipes.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists protest river pollution outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 5 August 2021 (Image credit: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2019, raw sewage was discharged for 1.5 million hours into rivers alone. The regularity of these discharges means rivers face “death by a thousand cuts”, said Mark Lloyd, chief executive of The Rivers Trust.\n\nOn the Windrush, for instance, campaigners say the water upstream of one sewage outlet is mostly clear and healthy; downstream it is cloudy and polluted with human waste, E. coli, domestic cleaning products, hormones and many other contaminants.\n\nWhy do these discharges happen?\n\n“Combined sewage overflows” are meant to discharge only during spells of heavy rainfall, to stop sewage backing up into streets and homes. But England’s ageing sewerage network is struggling to cope.\n\nThe water companies do face genuine difficulties, because the growing population and the increasing frequency of heavy rainfall are putting more stress on their systems, and the alternatives, such as installing extra storm tank storage or building new sewers, are costly; in London, the Tideway, a vast £4.1bn additional sewer, is being built to capture overflows.\n\nThe UK water industry has already invested £30bn in environmental work over 30 years. But environmentalists argue that that isn’t nearly enough; and that the water companies save themselves money by using sewage overflows routinely, not just in emergencies.\n\nWhy isn’t the pollution stopped?\n\nSince 2010, the EA’s enforcement funding has been cut by nearly two-thirds, from £120m to just £43m. In a letter obtained under Freedom of Information laws, the EA chair Emma Howard Boyd told George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, that this “has forced us to reduce or stop work it used to fund, with real-world impacts (e.g. on our ability to protect water quality) for which we and the Government are now facing mounting criticism”.\n\nAcross England’s 106,000 farms, the EA cut inspections by two-thirds, down from 905 in 2014-15 to 308 in 2019-20. At that rate, the average farm can expect to be inspected once every 344 years.\n\nThe rise of the wild swimmer\n\nSwimming outdoors has been a popular British pastime for centuries. Only recently was the term “wild swimming” coined for it – in Roger Deakin’s 1999 book Waterlog, a record of his quixotic quest to swim through the British Isles, via its rivers, lochs, tarns, moats, aqueducts, even the “chocolate water” of its city canals.\n\nThanks in part to books like Deakin’s, and the closure of public pools during the pandemic, it has become a craze: searches for the term “wild swimming” increased by 94% between 2019 and 2020.\n\n(Image credit: Ernesto Rogata/Loop Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nYet the polluted waterways of the UK can pose serious health risks thanks to harmful bacteria such as E. coli, salmonella and listeria, and – in rare cases – potentially fatal diseases such as leptospirosis and hepatitis A.\n\nThe wild swimmers, though, may turn out to be a powerful force for conservation. A stretch of the River Wharfe near Ilkley in Yorkshire last year became the first in the UK to be given “bathing status”, forcing Yorkshire Water and the EA to regularly monitor water quality and publish the results.\n\nFrom Port Meadow on the Thames in Oxford to the River Almond in Lothian, pushing for bathing water status is being seen as a way of driving clean-up campaigns. The Wharfe was given its first designation in April: “poor quality”.\n\nWill things get better?\n\nThe EA insists that, in some respects, they already have: England’s rivers are the cleanest they’ve been since the Industrial Revolution, with pollutants such as ammonia, mercury and cadmium greatly reduced over recent decades. But the EA’s chief executive James Bevan also admits that “not everything is getting better, and some things are getting worse”: notably “water pollution incidents” caused by farms and sewage companies.\n\nIn theory, things ought to improve. The Government is bound by the Water Framework Directive to ensure that all waters reach good ecological status by 2027; last month it was announced that the number of EA inspectors targeting farmers who pollute rivers would be trebled.\n\nBut campaigners argue that the 2027 target is too far away, and that anyway it will be missed (it was first set for 2015, then 2021). In the meantime, England’s rivers – home to a range of species such as trout, salmon and kingfishers, and beloved of walkers, swimmers and fishermen – continue to suffer grievously.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Peter Weber", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2023/06/07/detroit-air-quality-hazy-skies-canada-wildfires/70297183007/", "title": "Detroit air quality among the world's worst due to wildfires", "text": "Detroit had some of the worst air quality among major cities across the world Wednesday morning, according to IQAir's air quality index, thanks to the wildfire smoke drifting south from Canada, though conditions have since slightly improved.\n\nOnly Delhi, India, had worse air quality than Detroit among major cities as of 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, with an air quality index of 191 compared to Detroit's 164.

But the company, headed by founder and CEO Elon Musk, still has a few milestones to hit before it's ready for humans to board it.\n\nThe next test of the Starship, the sixth overall, is set to take place as soon as Monday evening – about a month since the last demonstration, SpaceX said.\n\nIn the years ahead, the Starship will play a role in NASA moon missions, helping to ferry astronauts back to the lunar surface for the first time in half-a-century.\n\nThe Starship is also integral in Musk's grand vision of eventually colonizing Mars. Musk has previously stated his vision of sending the first Starships to Mars in late 2026, the next time that Earth and Mars line up, followed by crewed flights in 2028.\n\nHere's what to know about Starship and its upcoming flight test:\n\nStarlink satellite deorbits:Video shows Starlink satellite that resembled fireball breaking up over the Southwest\n\nWhen will Starship launch on next test flight?\n\nSpaceX said on social media platform X last week that Starship's sixth flight test could launch as soon as Monday, Nov. 18.\n\nThe 30-minute launch window will open at 5 p.m. EST, according to SpaceX.\n\nAs of Tuesday, preparations for launch were underway at SpaceX's Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nAfter previous tests took place in the morning, this time around, SpaceX is adjusting the flight’s launch window to the late afternoon for \"better conditions for visual observations,\" the company said.\n\nWhat is the Starship?\n\nSpaceX has spent years developing and testing the Starship, which is classified as a super heavy-lift launch vehicle and is lauded as the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built.\n\nThe entire craft features two components: The 165-foot Starship spacecraft itself, and the 232-foot \"Super Heavy\" rocket it's perched atop. SpaceX envisions the powerful spacecraft being a fully reusable transportation system that can carry both humans and cargo to Earth's orbit, the moon and even Mars.\n\nIn its sixth test, the Starship itself is due to fly a similar trajectory over the Gulf of Mexico as in previous flights before landing for the third straight time in the Indian Ocean. As for the rocket booster, SpaceX officials hope to once again successfully steer it back autonomously to the landing pad before catching it with two giant mechanical arms.\n\nThis time around, SpaceX plans to reignite its Raptor engine in space to attempt an orbital burn – a maneuver needed for future orbital missions. Upon its descent, SpaceX will fly the ship at a \"higher angle of attack\" to test what it can handle on future landings.\n\nThe company has reportedly made several hardware upgrades ahead of the flight and improved safety features around its booster propulsion systems. The upcoming flight test will also assess new thermal protection.\n\nAudible sonic booms are expected in the area around the landing zone as the returning booster slows down from supersonic speeds, SpaceX said.\n\nStarship selected for NASA lunar missions\n\nThe Starship is due to play a vital role in NASA's lunar ambitions amid a heated international space race to get back to the moon. As part of the U.S. space agency's ambitious Artemis campaign, its first lunar program since the Apollo era of the 1970s, NASA is paying SpaceX $4 million to develop a spacecraft capable of safely transporting astronauts from orbit to the moon's surface.\n\nUnder NASA's plans, Artemis III astronauts aboard the Orion capsule would rendezvous and dock with Starship while orbiting the moon. Two astronauts would then board the Starship for a ride to the lunar surface while the other two spacefarers remain on Orion.\n\nIn the years ahead, NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a lunar settlement on the south pole. One day, the water ice thought to be abundant in the region could be extracted and used for drinking, breathing and as a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel to make crewed trips to Mars possible – such as the ones Musk is planning as early as 2028.\n\nStarship's first crewed test flight is planned for the third and final mission under the Polaris Program, which SpaceX is funding along with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The inaugural spaceflight in September under the program, Polaris Dawn, included the first-ever commercial spacewalk with the crew aboard a Dragon capsule.\n\nWhat happened on previous Starship tests?\n\nSince April 2023, Starship has undergone five test flights.\n\nWhile the rocket's first three tests ended in explosions, officials say it has improved in every demonstration they've conducted with the vehicle. The explosions came to an end in its fourth and fifth test flights when Starship managed to land successfully in the Indian Ocean in both June and October.\n\nOne of the biggest leaps in progress also came in the last flight test when SpaceX mission controllers not only returned the rocket booster to the launch site, but snatched it out of the air with two giant mechanical arms, nicknamed \"chopsticks.\"\n\nHaving the capability of catching the Starship booster is crucial for SpaceX, giving the company a completely reusable vehicle that is able to fly again.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

However, Elon Musk's aerospace company has noted that Starship went farther in November than the inaugural attempt in April.\n\nIts latest flight went even further.\n\nSpaceX had high expectations for the third go-around, which commentators on a live feed Thursday noted far surpassed what the company had achieved in previous attempts. The success is a positive sign for not only SpaceX, but also NASA, which awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission to the moon.\n\n\"I'm just completely blown away,\" said Dan Huot, SpaceX communications manager, who helped to host the live webcast. \"We're farther than we've ever been before.\"\n\nJapan rocket explosion:Space One Kairos rocket explodes while trying to take satellite to orbit\n\nWatch the full replay of SpaceX Starship launch\n\nA livestream of the SpaceX launch on X began roughly 30 minutes before the launch time of 9:25 a.m. ET.\n\nAs before, the launch took place at SpaceX’s private Starbase site in Boca Chica, Texas, near Brownsville on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWatch a replay here:\n\nWhat did SpaceX's latest Starship test flight accomplish?\n\nThe Starship succeeded in separating Thursday from the booster and proceeding to orbit within minutes of launching, where it conducted a series of in-flight tests while coasting through space.\n\nVideo of its flight was beamed back to Earth using SpaceX's Starlink Satellite network. While the video captured the beginning of the spacecraft's re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, the signal was lost about an hour into the mission before SpaceX concluded that the craft likely broke apart.\n\nDespite Starship's failure to make its planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean, SpaceX said the rocket still achieved several key milestones that had not been accomplished in the past two tests aimed to show how well the rocket's two stages work together in flight.\n\nEarly into the launch, SpaceX observed that all 33 of its Raptor engines in the booster worked as expected. Shortly thereafter, the Super Heavy booster stage separated from the Starship's upper stage and fell to Earth as the rocket made its way into orbit.\n\nSpaceX also reported a successful opening of the upper Starship rocket stage – a crucial capability that will allow the rocket to one day deploy Starlink satellites.\n\nPlans to attempt the first ever re-light of one of its upper stage Raptor engines while in space were scrapped, but SpaceX did conduct a propellant transfer test and succeeded in opening and closing the payload door.\n\nMusk has said he hopes there will be a half-dozen flights this year for Starship, which he said said Thursday on his social media site X \"will make life multiplanetary.\"\n\nWhat happened during the last Starship test?\n\nThe second launch test of the Starship on Nov. 18 saw the rocket explode after about 12 minutes into flight.\n\nWhile the rocket was able to achieve a stage separation and reach space, ground crew lost communications with it after nine minutes. Still, that was a marked improvement over the previous Starship test flight on April 20 in which several of the spacecraft's engines failed and exploded about four minutes after its launch before booster and spacecraft were able to even separate.\n\n“The real topping on the cake today, that successful liftoff,” SpaceX commentator John Insprucker said after the November test, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nInsprucker noted that for the first time, all 33 booster engines fired as designed and the booster separated seamlessly from the spaceship, which reached an altitude of 92 miles.\n\nHow is Starship involved in NASA moon missions?\n\nClassified as a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, the 400-foot-long Starship rocket is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built.\n\nNASA is paying SpaceX a hefty sum with the expectation that Musk's company will be able to develop a spacecraft capable of safely transporting astronauts to the moon's surface – likely in 2026. Starship would need to be able to transfer U.S. astronauts onboard from NASA's Orion capsule while in lunar orbit before heading down to the surface.\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon ahead of a moon landing itself a year later for Artemis III. But the Artemis program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues.\n\nOnce NASA is back on track in the years ahead, the agency intends to send a crew to the moon's unexplored south polar region, which Houston-based Intuitive Machines Odysseus spacecraft recently explored and studied.\n\nThe astronauts who eventually reach the surface of the moon for the first time in America's history since the Apollo program came to an end in 1972 will play a crucial role in future space exploration: NASA hopes those spacefarers will establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of missions to Mars.\n\nSpaceX's Starship rocket would be used to launch those future Martian missions, too.\n\n\"Congrats to SpaceX on a successful test flight,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Thursday in a post on X. \"Starship has soared into the heavens. Together, we are making great strides through Artemis to return humanity to the Moon – then look onward to Mars.\"\n\nContributing: Mike Snider; The Associated Press\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The vehicle's 232-foot \"Super Heavy\" rocket booster splashed down off the coast of Texas seven minutes after launch.\n\nThe spacecraft also includes the 165-foot Starship spacecraft itself, which flew for more than an hour before splashing down at 6:05 p.m. ET in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAs for the booster, SpaceX officials had hoped to replicate what they did for the first time in the previous test, steering it back autonomously to the landing pad before catching it with two giant mechanical arms. But during the flight, officials opted to skip the complex maneuver for safety reasons.\n\nIn an update on its website, SpaceX attributed the decision to data from \"automated health checks\" of hardware on both the launch and catch tower. SpaceX has not yet provided a more specific reason for why the booster catch was called off.\n\nThe company also reignited its Raptor engines in space to attempt an orbital burn – a crucial maneuver to one day bring a vehicle back to the ground. Tuesday's launch also included plans to fly the ship at a \"higher angle of attack\" to test what it can handle on future landings.\n\nOct. 13, 2024: SpaceX catches rocket booster in mechanical arm\n\nFor its fifth test flight, the empty Starship blasted off Oct. 13 from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. As in previous tests, the vehicle flew on a trajectory over the Gulf of Mexico into orbit.\n\nIn a first, the first-stage Super Heavy booster flew back to the launch pad. SpaceX had built a launch tower with massive mechanized metal arms, nicknamed \"chopsticks,\" that then managed to catch the descending booster in a daring maneuver.\n\nHaving the capability of catching the Starship booster is crucial for SpaceX, giving the company a completely reusable vehicle that is able to fly again.\n\nPrior to the booster dropping and landing, it had pushed the Starship upward into the atmosphere, sending it soaring more than 130 miles high.\n\nAn hour after liftoff, Starship made a controlled landing in the Indian Ocean. Ahead of the demo, SpaceX engineers reworked the rocket's heat shield, replacing the entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer.\n\nJune 6, 2024: Starship completes first-ever successful landing burn\n\nThe craft experienced a successful separation from the booster, which saw 32 of 33 engines igniting properly during launch, about seven minutes into the flight.\n\nThe booster successfully came back down to Earth and splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico as planned and all six of Starship's engines powered it into successful orbital insertion.\n\nHeat shields protecting the outside of the craft took a beating, with at least one throwing debris into one of the live-streaming external cameras, but it managed to make a successful reentry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nRoughly one hour and six minutes into the flight, Starship completed its first-ever landing burn and splashed down into the Indian Ocean to raucous applause.\n\nMarch 14, 2024: Starship reaches space before being lost in atmosphere\n\nIn the third test, the Starship succeeded in separating from the booster and proceeding to orbit within minutes of launching, where it conducted a series of in-flight tests while coasting through space.\n\nVideo of its flight beamed back to Earth using SpaceX's Starlink Satellite network was able to capture the beginning of the spacecraft's re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. However, the signal was lost about an hour into the mission before SpaceX concluded that the craft likely broke apart.\n\nDespite Starship's failure to make its planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean, SpaceX said the rocket still achieved several key milestones, including the successful firing of its 33 Raptor engines in the booster and the opening of a payload door.\n\nNov. 18, 2023: Starship makes it further in second test, but still explodes\n\nDuring the second launch test of the Starship, the rocket survived for longer and achieved some milestones, but it still eventually exploded.\n\nThe booster was able to successfully separate from the rocket, which reached space before the ground crew lost communication with it after nine minutes. Three minutes later, SpaceX lost both the booster and the spacecraft in two explosions.\n\nRather than seeing it as a setback, SpaceX expressed optimism about the stage separation while saying the rest would just be valuable data to help them remedy whatever went wrong.\n\nApril 20, 2023: Starship explodes minutes after inaugural launch\n\nThe Starship got off to a rough start when it exploded just four minutes into its inaugural test flight on April 20.\n\nThe craft was able to launch at SpaceX’s private Starbase site, but telemetry data revealed that several of the spacecraft's engines had failed, triggering the explosion before the booster and spacecraft could even separate.\n\nSpaceX later confirmed the rocket's flight termination system was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle before it met its fiery end.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Working toward an ultimate goal of delivering astronauts back and forth between the Earth, moon and even Mars, SpaceX has called each previous test flight an improvement on the last.\n\nSpaceX provided live coverage of the launch on the SpaceX website and X, formerly Twitter. The company has been provided millions in funding from NASA in hopes of producing a commercial rocket that can safely take astronauts to the moon by 2026.\n\nHere is what happened during the Starship's fourth test launch and its previous test flights.\n\nStarship test launches:Here's what happened in first 3 SpaceX Starship test launches\n\nSpaceX Starship successfully splashes down\n\nRoughly 49 minutes into the flight, Starship began its reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Starship's heat shields protected the craft as the atmosphere naturally slowed its descent without the use of engines to navigate toward the Earth's surface.\n\nAbout 57 minutes into the flight, external cameras on the craft caught one of the heat shields sparking and debris ripping from the ship's exterior. While the damaged camera made for a spotty livestream, flares of light prompted rounds of cheers from the crowd watching at the launch site.\n\nRoughly one hour and six minutes into the flight, Starship successfully completed its first-ever landing burn and splashed down into the Indian Ocean to raucous applause.\n\n\"Splashdown confirmed!\" SpaceX shared on X moments after landing. \"Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting fourth flight test of Starship!\"\n\nSpaceX Starship booster successfully splashes down\n\nAround 7 minutes and 20 seconds into the flight, the craft's booster successfully separated and splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico. All six of Starship's engines powered it into successful orbital insertion.\n\nSpaceX Starship takes off\n\nThe SpaceX Starship spacecraft lifted off from SpaceX’s private Starbase site in Boca Chica, Texas at 8:50 a.m. EDT Thursday.\n\nThis time, 32 of 33 booster engines lit as the craft launched. Roughly three minutes into the flight, the ship successfully began traveling on its own without the assistance of the booster.\n\nWhat is the goal of the Starship test launches?\n\nThe improving test launches are a positive sign for SpaceX and NASA, which awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission to the moon slated for 2026.\n\nNASA agreed to pay Elon Musk's company the hefty sum in hopes SpaceX will develop a spacecraft able to transport astronauts to the moon's surface.\n\n\"We’re continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond,\" said the space company in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNASA originally intended to launch this mission and its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The space agency then planned a moon landing for one year later, part of the Artemis III mission. However, the program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues.\n\nNASA intends to eventually send a crew to the moon's unexplored south-polar region in a mission that would be the first of its kind in American history since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nWhat happened during previous Starship test launches?\n\nSpaceX's Starship has had three previous test launches since April 2023. While all three ended in explosions, each one made strides toward the ultimate goal of developing rapidly reliable reusable rockets.\n\nStarship got off to a rough start when it exploded just four minutes into its inaugural test flight on April 20, 2023.\n\nThe craft launched from the Starbase site, but several of the craft's engines failed to ignite, triggering an explosion before the booster and spacecraft were able to separate. The rocket's flight termination system was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle, which reached a total height of about 24 miles above the ground.\n\nThe second launch attempt on Nov. 18, 2023, saw the craft survive longer and reach new milestones.\n\nThis time, the booster was able to successfully separate from the rocket, which reached space before the ground crew lost communication with it after nine minutes. Three minutes later, SpaceX lost both the booster and the spacecraft in two explosions.\n\nAll 33 booster engines fired as designed in this launch, and the ship reached an altitude of 92 miles.\n\nThe third test launch, which took place on March 14, saw Starship successfully separating from the booster and making it to orbit shortly after launch.\n\nA series of in-flight tests were conducted until Starship began to make its way back into the Earth's atmosphere, at which point signal to the craft was lost and about an hour into the mission and it was concluded the craft likely broke apart.\n\nSpaceX said this flight reached several more milestones, including the first reentry from space, first opening and closing of the craft's payload door in space and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/13/spacex-starship-launch/75583234007/", "title": "Starship launch: How to watch SpaceX test fly megarocket from ...", "text": "SpaceX is moving forward with plans to undergo the latest test flight of its Starship megarocket that will in the years ahead ferry NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon.\n\nThe impending launch represents the fifth uncrewed demonstration of the 400-foot behemoth and will follow last-minute approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who has grand visions of Starship transporting humans to Mars by 2028, announced his company's intention of targeting a Sunday launch even before getting the go-ahead from the FAA.\n\nLauded as the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, Starship managed to land successfully in the Indian Ocean in its most recent demonstration in June after its three previous flights ended in explosions. This time around, SpaceX engineers hope to replicate that landing while for the first time returning the Super Heavy booster rocket intact to the launch site.\n\nHere's how to watch the Starship's fifth test flight.\n\nStarship launch:SpaceX says its ready for 5th Starship test\n\nWhen is the Starship launch?\n\nStarship's fifth flight test is set for a Sunday, Oct. 13, takeoff with a 30-minute launch window opening at 8 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the launch date is later than SpaceX had hoped after Musk said the company was ready back in August, it's also sooner than the November timeframe that the FAA previously anticipated.\n\nAs of Thursday, it appeared that preparations for launch were underway at SpaceX's Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nHow to watch the Starship launch\n\nSpaceX will host a livestream of the flight test that will begin about 30 minutes before liftoff.\n\nThe webcast is available on its website and on social media platform X. Coverage will also be available on SpaceX's on new X TV app.\n\n\"As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates,\" SpaceX said.\n\nWhat to know about Starship\n\nSpaceX has spent years developing and testing the Starship, which is intended to play an integral role as early as 2026 when U.S. astronauts head back to the moon.\n\nAs part of NASA's ambitious Artemis campaign, the space agency's first lunar program since the Apollo era of the 1970s, SpaceX was paid a hefty $2.9 billion sum to develop a spacecraft capable of safely transporting astronauts from orbit to the moon's surface.\n\nIn the years ahead, NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a lunar settlement on the south pole. One day, the water ice thought to be abundant in the region could be extracted and used for drinking, breathing and as a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel to make crewed trips to Mars possible – such as the ones Musk is planning as early as 2028.\n\nStarship's first crewed test flight is planned for the third and final mission under the Polaris Program, which SpaceX is funding along with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The inaugural spaceflight last month under the program, Polaris Dawn, included the first-ever commercial spacewalk with the crew aboard a Dragon capsule.\n\nThe 165-foot Starship spacecraft, which has so far only undergone uncrewed demonstrations, managed to land in the Indian Ocean during its most recent demonstration in June, while the 232-foot rocket booster landed off the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhile its previous three tests ended in explosions, SpaceX officials say the craft's performance has improved in every demonstration they've conducted with the vehicle. That included its third demonstration in March, when SpaceX said Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that were a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The photos were chosen from hundreds of images captured by the lander's cameras, which were programmed to take five images every five minutes for the first two hours after separating from the SpaceX's rocket's second stage.\n\n\"Out of all the images collected, Intuitive Machines chose to show humanity’s place in the universe with four wonderful images we hope to inspire the next generation of risk-takers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nInteractive maps:How long will the solar eclipse darkness last in your city?\n\nOdysseus remains on track for a Thursday moon landing attempt\n\nNamed for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" Odysseus has the potential to be a history-making spacecraft if it touches down on the moon.\n\nNo commercially-built lander has ever made it to the lunar surface, and it's been more than 50 years since the last American moon landing in 1972 as part of NASA's Apollo program.\n\nBut Intuitive Machines' lander is hardly the first to make the attempt.\n\nIn January, Pittsburgh-based aerospace company Astrobotic sent its Peregrine lander on a doomed mission to the moon that ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days later. Shortly after separating from the United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, Peregrine's propulsion began leaking a critical amount of propellant that forced Astrobotic to eventually abandon plans of landing on the moon.\n\nThe outlook for Odysseus appears to be more optimistic, with Intuitive Machines reporting that the spacecraft is still on track to attempt a moon landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region. Scientists have long been interested in studying the south pole due to the presence of water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nAfter liftoff Thursday, the 14-foot-tall Nova-C lander reached its intended orbit about 48 minutes later and established communication with ground control in Houston, Intuitive Machines said. A successful engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nFlight controllers reported Sunday that Odysseus \"continues to be in excellent health\" as they prepare for a Wednesday \"lunar orbit insertion\" a day ahead of the touchdown.\n\nThe landing will be streamed on the company's IM-1 mission landing page. Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, will also take over the exterior of the Las Vegas sphere during the landing attempt, according to a press release.\n\n“We are keenly aware of the immense challenges that lie ahead,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said in a statement after the launch. “However, it is precisely in facing these challenges head-on that we recognize the magnitude of the opportunity before us: to softly return the United States to the surface of the Moon for the first time in 52 years.”\n\nNASA hopes mission paves the way for astronauts to return to moon\n\nIntuitive Machines' lunar mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface. If Intuitive Machines can pull off the mission, it would open the door for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon. The scientific instruments will collect valuable data for NASA as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program.\n\nThe mission, and others like it ahead, is intended to pave the way for human exploration of the moon.\n\nNASA delayed plans for Artemis II until 2025, which is when a group of spacefarers could finally embark on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The mission would be the precursor to Artemis III years later, when another crew of astronauts will set out to land on the lunar surface itself.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

It is hoped this will eventually serve as a springboard to send humans to Mars.\n\nArtemis 1 “represents a crucial turning point in NASA’s moon plans”, said CNBC. The 42-day mission involves the inaugural launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) mega-rocket, which will carry the unmanned Orion spacecraft beyond the Moon.\n\n“The 98-metre Space Launch System is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built,” said Sky News, “and in this crucial testing phase it will fly further than any spacecraft built for humans: 40,000 miles past the far side of the moon and 280,000 miles from Earth.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAccording to Nasa, each of its two boosters generates more thrust than 14 four-engine commercial airliners combined.\n\n“The purpose of Artemis 1 is to put vehicles and systems through their paces before putting astronauts aboard in 2024,” said The Times.\n\nFor Artemis 1, the Orion capsule, which can hold up to six astronauts, will carry just mannequins, including Commander Moonikin Campos, and a Snoopy soft toy to float around the cabin as a zero gravity indicator.\n\nProvided this initial test flight is a success, Artemis 2 will carry four as-yet-unnamed astronauts on an eight-to-ten day mission that includes a fly-by of the Moon.\n\nArtemis 3, planned for 2025, will finally land humans on the lunar surface, with Nasa saying the crew will include the first woman and person of colour. All 12 people to have landed on the Moon, between 1969 and 1972, have been white men from the US.\n\nWhat is the timeline?\n\nNasa is not commenting publicly about the rescheduled Artemis 1 launch but it could be as soon as Friday or next Monday, weather permitting and provided engineers solve the engine cooling issue.\n\n“Launch opportunities are limited by the stage of the moon and lighting conditions upon re-entry, among other considerations,” reported Space.com, so if Nasa misses this window then the next launch attempt is likely to be in October.\n\nNo firm timeline for the next stage of the project, which includes establishing a permanent base on the Moon followed by a manned mission to Mars, has been announced but it is not likely to get the go-ahead until the end of the decade or into the 2030s.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nWith the world in the midst of an energy and cost-of-living crisis, many are questioning the value of spending tens of billions of dollars on sending a handful of people into space.\n\nIt is estimated that US taxpayers will end up paying $93bn to fund the Artemis programme, with Florida Today arguing that the giant SLS “stands at risk of going down as one of the biggest boondoggles in spaceflight history if Nasa can’t find a way to control costs”.\n\nThe Observer said in an editorial: “It is a colossal investment and there are nagging doubts that it is justified at a time when private space companies, such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, are developing giant reusable rockets that could slash deep-space mission cost.”\n\nOthers have suggested it would be more cost-efficient to send robots into space in place of humans, seeing as they require no life-support system and do not need to be brought home.\n\nYet for all the talk of cost-benefits, there are other factors to consider.\n\nThe first is political. “Despite the delays, and absorbing much of Nasa’s relatively small budget by federal agency standards, the Artemis programme has enjoyed strong bipartisan political support,” said CNBC, in part because the SLS development has engaged many different partners around the US and the world.\n\nA map on Nasa’s website shows contributing contractors in every US state and more than 20 partners across Europe. “Keeping those aerospace industry jobs going became a yearly focus for many in the US Congress hoping to boost their political standing with constituents and district aerospace companies,” said Space.com, helping to give SLS and the Artemis programme “staying power”.\n\nRussia and China threat\n\nThere is also concern that Russia and China could step in to fill a lunar void left by the US. Last year the two authoritarian regimes announced a joint plan to build a research station on the Moon, raising serious security concerns among Western analysts.\n\nThen there is the argument that lunar travel “transformed our understanding of our place in the universe”, said The Observer.\n\nNot only did the Apollo missions 50 years ago inspire a new generation, but observations, experiences and images such as Bill Anders’ iconic 1968 “Earthrise” photo “underlined the fragility of the Earth and played a key role in the birth of the environment movement in the late 1960s”, said the paper.\n\n“From that perspective,” it added, “lunar travel can be seen to have provided value for money and suggests there is still something to be gained from continuing to put men and women into space.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Peter Weber", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2018/03/06/spacex-launches-spanish-satellite-50th-successful-falcon-9-mission/368987002/", "title": "SpaceX launches Spanish satellite for 50th successful Falcon 9 ...", "text": "Eight years ago, SpaceX was a startup trying to launch a big rocket for the first time, led by a Silicon Valley millionaire who made crazy claims about landing and reusing rockets.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nThe now 6,000-person company early Tuesday notched its 50th successful Falcon 9 mission, lifting the heaviest communications satellite the rocket has carried yet from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nIgniting nine Merlin engines at 12:33 a.m., the 230-foot rocket roared into darkness from Launch Complex 40 with a Spanish satellite that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk described as \"almost the size of a city bus.\"\n\nThirty-three minutes later, the rocket released Madrid-based satellite operator Hispasat's 30W-6 spacecraft, weighing more than 13,000 pounds, on its way to an orbit 22,300 miles over the equator.\n\n\"Very proud of the SpaceX team!\" Musk said on Twitter. \"Can’t believe it’s been fifty Falcon 9 launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldn’t even reach orbit with little Falcon 1.\"\n\nRough seas prevented SpaceX from attempting to land the Falcon 9's first-stage booster, which was not expected to survive its splashdown in 26-foot waves.\n\nThe rocket's 50th successful mission took flight less than eight years after the first launched from the same pad on June 4, 2010, flying a demonstration mission for NASA.\n\n[Launch schedule: Upcoming Florida rocket launches and landings]\n\n[SpaceX just launched the first set of its internet-beaming Starlink satellites]\n\nSpaceX then was unproven entity regarded with skepticism by much of the industry — especially Musk’s brash promises to make rockets reusable and to colonize Mars. Just two years earlier, the company had been on the brink of failure before a successful launch of the much smaller Falcon 1 rocket — after several mishaps — led to a $1.6 billion NASA contract.\n\nFlash forward to today: SpaceX has landed Falcon boosters 23 times and re-flown boosters nine times, including two on last month’s inaugural launch of the Falcon Heavy, the world’s new most powerful rocket.\n\nThe Falcon 9 achieved 50 successful launches more than four years faster than United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V, which debuted in 2002 and has served as the U.S. government’s workhorse for national security and high-value science payloads.\n\nULA, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture formed in 2006, recently completed the 76th Atlas V mission without a major failure. But with SpaceX planning to launch as many as 30 times this year alone, the lower-cost Falcon 9 may not take long to catch up.\n\nSpaceX’s march to 50 launches was not without setbacks.\n\nOne Falcon 9 rocket broke apart just over two minutes into a 2015 flight for NASA. Another exploded on its Launch Complex 40 pad in 2016, destroying a commercial satellite. Those two missions aren’t counted among the 50 celebrated Tuesday.\n\nBut SpaceX rebounded with an 18-mission surge last year, and aims to exceed that total this year.\n\nThe company's biggest test awaits: a first launch of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on a test flight tentatively targeted for December.\n\nThe Hispasat satellite, built by California-based SSL, will provide high-definition broadcasting and broadband Internet service to Europe, the Mediterranean and the Americas.\n\n“This capacity will enable us to contribute to the reduction of the digital divide on three continents, and that is something that fills us with satisfaction,” said Antonio Abad, Hispasat’s chief technology officer.\n\nThe satellite became Hispasat’s 11th in orbit, concluding an ambitious expansion that more than doubled the company's fleet over the past five years. It should enter service in June.\n\nThe mission is the latest example of SpaceX bringing a commercial launch and an international customer back to Cape Canaveral. A decade ago, those missions had almost entirely moved overseas while ULA focused on higher-cost U.S. government missions.\n\n[Atlas V and GOES-S weather satellite set sail from Cape Canaveral]\n\n[Big year of science launches starts with GOES-S weather satellite]\n\nHispasat last launched from the Cape in 2000 and 2002, on Atlas rockets.\n\nTuesday's launch was delayed from Feb. 25 for tests of the pressurization system in the Falcon 9 rocket’s nose cone, which worked as designed.\n\nFollowing ULA’s launch last Thursday of the GOES-S weather satellite on an Atlas V rocket, the mission was the second in five days from the Eastern Range and sixth from the Cape this year.\n\nThe Range managed by the Air Force's 45th Space Wing now enters a lull until early April, when SpaceX could return with another launch of International Space Station supplies — the same type of mission that started the Falcon 9's career.\n\nContact Dean at 321-242-3668 or jdean@floridatoday.com.

The counter-attacks galvanized Ukraine’s Western backers and caused anger in Russia, which has time and again been stymied in its full-scale assault of its neighboring state that it launched seven months ago.\n\nRussian police officers detain a person during an unsanctioned rally, after opposition activists called for street protests against the mobilisation of reservists ordered by President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, Russia September 21, 2022. Reuters\n\n“Our country also has various means of destruction and in some components more modern than those of the NATO countries, and if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,” Putin said in his speech Wednesday indicating a possible new chapter in the months-long conflict.\n\nAddressing the potential for escalation and use of nuclear weapons, Putin said: “Those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the prevailing winds can turn in their direction.”\n\nThe announcement comes as Russia is believed to face shortages of manpower and follows amendments to Russia’s law on military service made Tuesday, which raise the penalties for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order during a period of mobilization or martial law.\n\nPutin framed the ongoing fighting as part of a larger struggle for Russian survival against a West whose goal is it is to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country.” Several Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine announced that they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia this week, votes that have widely been dismissed as shams intended to boost Putin’s justifications for further attacks on Ukrainian territory.\n\n“They are already saying directly that they were able to split the Soviet Union in 1991 and now the time has come for Russia to break up into a multitude of regions and areas which are fatally hostile to each other,” Putin said.\n\nBut NATO leaders dismissed the announcement as a sign of panic in the Kremlin, and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine’s military.\n\nPolice officers detain a person in Moscow on September 21, 2022, following calls to protest against partial mobilisation announced by President Vladimir Putin. - President Vladimir Putin called up Russian military reservists on September 21, saying his promise to use all military means in Ukraine was \"no bluff,\" and hinting that Moscow was prepared to use nuclear weapons. His mobilisation call comes as Moscow-held regions of Ukraine prepare to hold annexation referendums this week, dramatically upping the stakes in the seven-month conflict by allowing Moscow to accuse Ukraine of attacking Russian territory. ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden condemned the mobilization and the Kremlin’s planned votes, during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\n“Just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats towards Europe … now Russia is calling up more soldiers to join the fight, and the Kremlin is organizing sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine,” Biden said. “The world should see these outrageous acts for what they are.\n\n“Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened, but no one threatened Russia – and no one other than Russia sought conflict,” Biden added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz meanwhile called the mobilization an “act of despair.”\n\n“Russia cannot win this war. But this is a kind of panic reaction,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added Wednesday.\n\nA destroyed Russian tank in Izium, a town recently liberated by Ukrainian Armed Forces. Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\nReferendums announced\n\nThe referendums, which Putin backed during his speech Wednesday, could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.\n\nIn what appeared to be a coordinated announcement, Russian-appointed leaders in the occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic all said they planned to hold “votes” beginning on September 23.\n\nTogether the four regions that have announced their referendum plans make up around 18% of Ukraine’s territory. Russia does not control any of the four in their entirety.\n\nThe expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.\n\nUkraine has dismissed the announcement of referendums in the occupied regions as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat,” while the the country’s Western supporters signaled they would not alter their support for Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure. The United States will never recognize Russia’s claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nPutin on Wednesday said Russia has been asked for support from the two “people’s republics” and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia for the referendums and had pledged to do “everything to ensure the safe conditions for people to express their will.”\n\nPotential for escalation\n\nThe announcements had already received swift support from Russian politicians. Former Russian President and vice-chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has publicly endorsed referendums in the self-declared Donbas republics, saying this would have “huge significance” for “systemic protection” of the residents.\n\n“Encroachment on Russian territory is a crime which allows you to use all the forces of self-defense,” Medvedev said on his Telegram channel, in an apparent allusion to the potential for the military escalation.\n\nBut social media video geolocated by CNN showed protests in several Russian cities on Wednesday, each involving what appear to have been a few dozen people. The independent monitoring group OVD-Info said that more than 100 people had been detained at anti-mobilization demonstrations in total.\n\nIt’s unclear what form an escalation could take, but concerns have been raised throughout the conflict over whether Russia would resort to using its nuclear stockpile in the Ukraine.\n\nA billboard promoting contract army service, with the slogan \"Serving Russia is a real job,\" in St. Petersburg. Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden addressed these concerns in a 60 Minutes interview earlier this week, when a reporter asked what he would say to the Russian leader regarding the use of chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n“Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,” Biden said, adding that the US response to such actions would be “consequential.”\n\nPutin endorsed a new “deterrent” strategy in June 2020 that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack on Russia that threatened its existence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, amended the law on military service, toughening the punishment for violation of military service duties – such as desertion and evasion from service – according to state news agency TASS.\n\nThe bill sets a jail term of up to 15 years for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order, involving violence or the threat of its use, during the period of mobilization or martial law.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Rob Picheta", "Simone Mccarthy", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/tech/meta-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-nick-clegg/index.html", "title": "How Mark Zuckerberg is trying to reduce his exposure to public ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen Russia moved to “partially restrict” Facebook access in the country last week, drawing the social network deeper into an international conflict, it prompted a defiant response from the company’smost visible representative on the world stage.\n\nNot Mark Zuckerberg, but Nick Clegg.\n\n“Yesterday, Russian authorities ordered us to stop independent fact-checking and labeling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organizations. We refused,” Clegg, the newly-appointed president of global affairs at Facebook-parent Meta, said in the statement. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard.”\n\nIn the days following that statement, Clegg has announced new safety features for users in Russia and Ukraine, crackdowns on Russian state-media on its platforms, and other steps Meta is taking to address the conflict, including communicating with foreign governments about the issue. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has not yet publicly commented on the conflict.\n\nThe statements underscore Clegg’s ascent to being the policy face of Meta, following his promotion last month.But they also hint at how Zuckerberg may be trying to pull off a disappearing act of sorts. The CEO and founder, according to former insiders and industry watchers, appears to be attemptingto reduce his visibility — and potentially the scrutiny he faces — on the world stage even as he runsa suite of platforms with a collective user base far larger than any country.\n\nClegg, the former UK deputy prime minister who has worked as Meta’s vice president of global affairs and communications since 2018, was already involved in policy matters and routinely served as an aggressive public voice for the company. But with his promotion last month, Zuckeberg said Clegg will now “lead and represent us for all of our policy issues globally.” Zuckerberg also said the change would free up his own time to work on product and technology as the company invests in its vision for a virtual and augmented reality-enabled future, and would let COO Sheryl Sandberg focus more on its business, which currently faces a host of challenges.\n\nAs Meta pushes forward with its multibillion-dollar bet to reshape the company, Zuckerberg will get to focus on his vision for building a (currently still conceptual) “metaverse,” while Clegg will be tasked with explaining and justifying it and the company’s other actions to lawmakers, regulators and the public.\n\n“When I look at this, the promotion of Nick Clegg in a sense doesn’t change anything for his role, but I think the idea is to give him a title so big that Zuckerberg doesn’t have to testify [at government hearings] anymore,” said Roger McNamee, a former Facebook investor and advisor to Zuckerberg who in 2019 published the book “Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.”\n\nBut, he added, “it’s very clear to me that Mark’s vision is driving the company right now.”\n\nMeta declined to comment on this story.\n\nSome Meta followers say the leadership shuffle seems to mirror similar moves made by other tech founders, including Microsoft (MSFT)’sBill Gates, Amazon (AMZN)’sJeff Bezos and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google (GOOG), all of whom stepped away from public-facing roles as their businesses faced growing scrutiny -— while retaining immense control and influence over the companies. Like those founders, Zuckerberg remains the largest shareholder with tremendous influence over Meta’s business. Unlike those founders, he also remains CEO.\n\nBut in some ways, it also represents an attempt to return to a time when Facebook was less under fire.\n\nA return to simpler times\n\nBefore 2016, the division of labor among Facebook’s top brass looked different: Zuckerberg handled the engineering and product side of the business, and Sandberg handled “everything else,” according to Nu Wexler, who worked as a spokesperson for the company from 2017 to 2018.\n\nBut that changed, Wexler said, following the US Presidential election in 2016. Facebookstarted facing more questions about its role in democratic processes and society at large, with Zuckerberg called to testify several times before Congress and the European Parliament in the years that followed.\n\nClegg was hired by the company in 2018 against that backdrop. Although his own political career was somewhat ill-fated, Clegg’s political experience and connections were seen as assets to the company, amid growing questions from lawmakers and regulators around the world. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were said to have been closely involved in recruiting him to the company.\n\nSince then, Facebook-turned-Meta has faced a slew of new PR and policy crises. A short list includes: its 2018 admission that it didn’t do enough to prevent its role in a genocide in Myanmar, European regulators passing data privacy regulations; US antitrust regulators seeking to break up the company; the January 6 Capitol riot that was organized in part on Facebook; and, most recently, the release of the Facebook Papers, which Clegg was involved in addressing last year.\n\nWith his promotion, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg has effectively become the company's most public face on policy issues. Harry Murphy/Sportsfile for Web Summit/Getty Images\n\nClegg’s elevated profile, Wexler said, shows how the challenges Meta faces on public policy have grown too large to be housed solely within Sandberg’s department. It also underscores how Sandberg’s own responsibilities — particularly wrestling with the future of Meta’s ad business, which is now under threat due to Apple’s ad tracking changes and competition from rivals like TikTok — have given her less time to devote to policy matters.\n\nClegg’s new role means that in addition to handling Meta’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he’ll also likely take a leading role in some of the company’s most pressing upcoming decisions. Those includehow to ensure the platform isn’t compromised by misinformation or foreign actors during the upcoming US midterm elections later this year and how to respond to calls to protect children on its platforms.\n\nAn especially important test will come when Meta must decide in January 2023 whether to permit former President Donald Trump back on its platforms ahead of the next presidential election, said Katie Harbarth, a Facebook alum who helped lead the company’s global election efforts until her departure last year. Whether Zuckerberg plays a role in that decision will send an important signal about who is truly in charge, she said.\n\n‘Mark can run, but he can’t hide’\n\nClegg’s promotion undeniably makes him more visible, particularly in international business forums like Davos where being an official member of the C-suite opens many doors, said Harbath. The change may also mean that Clegg will be the executive Meta tries to put forward for future hearings on Capitol Hill and with other government leaders abroad.\n\n“I think that the company got to the realization that Mr. Zuckerberg does not represent the company well externally, especially not in the political context,” Luria said. “That his appearances before Congress probably did the company more damage than they did good and putting somebody like Mr. Clegg in that position seems like a far better choice whenever they can.”\n\nThe question is whether hostile governments around the world will accept Clegg as a spokesman of authority or whether policymakers will continue to demand Zuckerberg. Watch any high-profile Big Tech hearing where a company is represented by anyone other than the CEO and the annoyance among government representatives is palpable.\n\n“At the end of the day, Mark can run, but he can’t hide from the regulatory pressure,” Harbath said. “I really like Nick. I think he is going to be a really great person to talk to policymakers and relate to them. But I don’t think it’s going to stop people from wanting to talk to Mark.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-thursday-live-updates/75384964007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene updates: Category 1 storm rumbles into Georgia", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene from Thursday, Sept. 26. For the latest news on the storm, read USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, Sept. 27.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Hurricane Helene made landfall Thursday night carrying catastrophic 140 mph winds as the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET near Perry, Florida. Hours later, the system weakened to a Category 1 storm and continued to produce hurricane-force winds as it moved toward Georgia.\n\nBy 3 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said Helene had sustained winds of 80 mph. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said further weakening is expected as the storm moves inland.\n\nAt least one fatality in Florida was blamed on the hurricane so far, authorities said. Officials feared more fatalities would be discovered on Friday, though it would likely be several hours before any rescue personnel could head out to help those in need.\n\nThe storm has already forced closures of schools, airports, and roadways across Florida after Helene rapidly intensified within hours Thursday as it moved through the Gulf of Mexico. More than 70,000 people across four counties – Franklin, Taylor, Liberty and Wakulla – fled under mandatory evacuations as forecasters painted a grim picture of the potential destruction ahead.\n\n\"This will not be a survivable event for those in coastal or low lying areas,\" Wakulla County Sheriff Jared Miller said in a Facebook post. \"There has not been a storm of this magnitude to hit Wakulla in recorded history.\"\n\nForecasters warned that strong, damaging winds will \"penetrate well inland\" across the southeastern U.S. The hurricane center urged people to remain sheltered until Helene fully passed their area, warning that the center of a hurricane is deceptively calm, as hazardous winds rapidly intensify once the eye passes.\n\nHelene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. In anticipation of the storm’s sprawling impact, President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations ahead of Helene's landfall for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama to mobilize federal emergency management resources.\n\n“Helene is a very dangerous hurricane and could become a ‘once-in-a-generation storm’ across western South Carolina and North Carolina, as well as northern and eastern Georgia,” said AccuWeather senior director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin.\n\nNews about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nHurricane Helene tracker:See projected path of 'catastrophic' storm as Florida braces\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp confirmed early Friday that two people died after a suspected tornado touched down in Wheeler County, about 88 miles southeast of Macon. Emergency management authorities in a neighboring county, Jeff Davis county, urged people to shelter-in-place due to high winds in the area.\n\n∎ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed one hurricane-related fatality late Thursday. A car driving on Interstate 4 in Tampa was hit with an overhead road sign.\n\n∎ Helene is the 4th U.S. landfalling hurricane of 2024. Only five other years on record have had four or more hurricane landfalls: 1886, 1909, 1985, 2005 and 2020.\n\n∎ Asheville, North Carolina, more than 400 miles from the landfall location, got 8.34 inches of rain over 26 hours from Wednesday until 4 p.m. Thursday, according to National Weather Service data. The estimated 1-in-1,000- year rainfall for 24 hours in that location is 7.25 inches.\n\n∎ The Florida Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which links St. Petersburg to Bradenton, after winds at the span reached 60 mph and conditions deteriorated.\n\n∎ Florida State and Florida A&M Universities canceled classes but opened their doors to students and Tallahassee residents. The American Red Cross was using FAMU’s Al Lawson Center on campus as a shelter open to the general public; FSU was opening a refugee facility at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center on Thursday to registered students who live off-campus.\n\nHow much damage could Helene do?\n\nIt's too early yet for detailed damage reports from the counties that Helene ripped across. But the National Hurricane Center says Category 4 storms threaten well-built framed homes with \"severe\" damage, potentially losing both roofs and walls. Most trees are snapped or uprooted and power poles are downed.\n\n\"Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\" the hurricane center says of Cat 4 storms.\n\nMore than one million utility customers in Florida were without power by midnight, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker. The number was expected to rise as Helene moved further inland.\n\nIn addition to hazardous winds, the system is expected to bring tornadoes, life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to large swaths of the Southeast, with widespread totals of 6 to 12 inches. Isolated areas could be deluged with 20 inches of rain.\n\nAt midnight in Tallahassee, the storm had significantly intensified, with sheets of rain gusting from the sky. Electricity service in some of the city flickered intermittently.\n\nRainfall was also lashing Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and the Carolinas have declared states of emergencies as the fast-moving storm barrels through the Florida coast.\n\n\"We will likely avoid the brunt of this storm, but it is still expected to bring flooding, high winds and isolated tornadoes,\" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. \"Take proper precautions and monitor local forecasts.\"\n\nIn central Georgia, local news outlets reported that two people were dead after a mobile home overturned in a suspected tornado Thursday.\n\n– Christopher Cann, Doyle Rice\n\nLearn more on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale and the dangers of storm surge.\n\n'They’ve got to get out': Some residents ignore evacuation order\n\nFor some people, even the threat of \"unsurvivable'' storm surge is not enough to convince them to leave their homes. A Florida official from Helene's projected path finds that quite frustrating.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, whose jurisdiction covers St. Petersburg and Clearwater, admonished residents who refuse to heed an evacuation order when he held a Thursday morning news conference as Helene zeroed in on Florida's northwest coast.\n\n“We’ve got a problem, and the problem is that way too many people in Zone A aren’t listening,” Gualtieri said. “We’ve been out there this morning, there’s just way too many people in the area.”\n\nA storm surge of 5-8 feet is predicted for the county, putting residents of barrier islands and low-lying coastal areas in danger.\n\n“They’ve got to get out,'' Gualtieri said, \"and there’s going to reach a point where you’re on your own because we’re not going to get our people killed because you don’t want to listen to what we’re saying.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nSheriff takes grim tack with evacuation holdouts\n\nIn Taylor County, Florida, where Helen’s storm surge is forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet high, the sheriff’s office posted a message Thursday morning for residents who weren’t heeding the county’s mandatory evacuation order.\n\n“If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the message said. The post also asked residents staying behind to send an email to the office with their names, addresses, contact information and the number of people and pets at the location.\n\nThe small rural county on the state’s gulf coast was the site of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August 2023 and Hurricane Debby’s landfall in August.\n\nGene Taylor, a former public official in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall there in 2005, has another message he gives to people considering riding out a potentially deadly storm surge. “Have life jackets and an ax, in case they have to chop through the attic roof to get out.”\n\nMany people were rescued from rooftops when the water rose after Katrina and in other locations after severe flooding.\n\n− Dinah Pulver Voyles and Doyle Rice\n\nHead of FEMA to take first-hand look at storm impacts\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit Florida on Friday to assess the impacts of the storm and report back to Biden.\n\nCriswell said she would fly as close as she could to Tallahassee and meet with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his team. The FEMA leader said she would like to take an aerial tour if possible so she can see the damage for herself. Afterward, she is prepared to move up to Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, also expected to be heavily affected by Helene.\n\n\"Me being on the ground helps me validate some of the damage more quickly, so we can get major declarations in place faster,\" she told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday, adding the agency has the resources it needs to respond to this disaster.\n\nCriswell said FEMA has aggressively deployed resources in advance of Helene's arrival and advised those likely to be impacted to do the same, both in Florida and across inland locations far from the storm's landfall. Parts of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and the Appalachians could get up to 20 inches of rain and experience widespread flooding.\n\n\"Take the storm seriously,'' Criswell said. \"People in Hurricane Helene's path, you need to listen to your local officials. If they tell you to evacuate, please do so, and if they tell you to shelter in place, then that's what you should do. They're going to give you the best information that you can do for your specific situation. Those decisions can save lives.\"\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nDespite pleas from grown children, couple choose to stay\n\nAs the storm rolled closer to the coast, a small number of people in St. Marks made last-minute preparations amid steady rain and increasing wind.\n\nJohn and Melissa Hines, who own and operate the Sweet Magnolia Inn near the water’s edge, piled all of the furniture on their ground floor onto tables and moved a massaging armchair onto the landing. They were planning to stick around until the storm hit, then relocate to their son’s apartment about a mile up the road on higher ground.\n\nLegend has it their pre-WWII building was built using old railroad tracks from the line that used to serve the area, and it has withstood multiple hurricanes, John Hines said, though different storms have left their marks.\n\n“The building will remain. What we have to work with after remains to be seen,” he said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe couple have four children, and the three who do not live nearby have been urging them to leave the area more quickly, Melissa Hines said. One of them, she said, even called their pastor in Ohio, who then reached out to add his encouragement.\n\n“Our faith is great,” Melissa Hines said, explaining why they aren’t seeking safety further from the storm. “Our pastor called and said, ‘Your kids are worried, you need to be wise. Stop being so stubborn.’ So we are going to leave but we’re going to stay close to home.”\n\nHelene could bring three times the rain it takes to cause landslides\n\nHelene is forecast to bring as much as 15 inches of rain to western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains − well over the accepted threshold of 5 inches needed to trigger dangerous and potentially deadly landslides.\n\nAccording to Brad Johnson, environmental science professor at Davidson College north of Charlotte, \"Scientists established some thresholds in North Carolina in the wake of the 2004 Peeks Creek landslide, the deadliest in North Carolina in 60 years.\"\n\nThat slide, triggered by rains from Hurricane Ivan, killed five people. Johnson's group looked at weather data from that slide and found that 5 inches was roughly the threshold for landslides to occur, he said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nManatees could be left stranded by Hurricane Helene\n\nFish, birds and other animals are all impacted differently by storms, depending on their habitat, food sources and other factors, wildlife experts told USA TODAY.\n\nManatees may become stranded or injured by debris from Hurricane Helene. In years past, they have been discovered after hurricanes in a dry bay, in a golf course pond and a retention pond. However, larger sea creatures like sharks and whales have likely been able to swim away from Hurricane Helene quickly, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nAfter Hurricane Idalia in 2023, flamingos from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula ended up in the U.S., in places they had never been seen before, including Missouri and Kansas.\n\nWhen fish die during a hurricane, the most common reason is low oxygen levels in water that has been pushed up from the bottom and may contain lethal hydrogen sulfide. Also, if there are long stretches of cloudy days amid a storm, oxygen-producing organisms and plants can't photosynthesize, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nRiding it out on a fishing boat\n\nIn Saint Marks, 30 miles south of Tallahassee where two rivers meet before emptying into Apalachee Bay, a handful of residents and business owners watched the water rising by several inches every 30 minutes on Thursday. Stone crab fisherman Philip Tooke, 63, stood on the dock of his family owned Saint Mark’s Seafoods, watching the rain and for signs the wind direction was changing.\n\nHe’s had head-height floodwaters beneath his building several times over the years, but he's worried what a 15-foot storm surge would mean. He and his brother planned to ride out the storm aboard their fishing boats.\n\n“I feel sorry for them to the east, but if we don’t get that direct hit we’ll be OK,” Tooke said. “It ain’t got ‘bad bad’ yet. It will be by tonight. It’s not going to be pleasant down here.”\n\nFlights canceled, airports closed\n\nNearly 1,200 U.S. flights were canceled by early Thursday because of Hurricane Helene, according to FlightAware. Tampa International Airport, St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport and Tallahassee International Airport in Florida all announced they will be closed for the day, but the storm's impacts extend beyond its projected path. Airlines began offering travel waivers earlier this week so customers could reschedule their plans around the storm.\n\nAnyone whose flight was canceled is eligible for a refund under Department of Transportation rules. Federal laws do not require airlines to compensate travelers for delayed flights, but carriers have committed to various degrees of compensation for significant delays within their control.

Because some are staying through the storm, so will he. His church is fresh from a roof repair done Wednesday in preparation for Helene. Now, he says, it's ready to keep anyone dry who needs a place to stay as the hurricane bears down on their town.\n\n\"We're going to trust the Lord − no matter,\" Nawlin said. \"He didn't ask us to understand everything. Just trust.\"\n\nMost Florida schools cancel classes\n\nMost Florida schools were closed Thursday ahead of Hurricane Helene’s landfall, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. The Florida Department of Education issued a news release with a list of school closures, and the department said it’s working closely with districts to get them the resources they need to resume normal operations as soon as possible.\n\nThe University of Florida in Gainesville was closed Thursday, and Florida A&M University and the New College of Florida closed earlier this week, through Friday, according to the education department’s statement. At least 33 other colleges and universities are temporarily shutting down their campuses, according to the Florida Department of Education.\n\nDozens of school districts across the state are also closed, affecting K-12 students, as the entire state is blanketed in hurricane and tornado watches.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nFlooding begins along southwest, central Florida coast\n\nFloodwaters began to inundate roads along the central and southwest coast of Florida on Thursday morning. In communities including Fort Myers Beach, Sarasota, Venice, Bradenton and several in the Tampa Bay area, officials have announced road closures as heavy rain and storm surge lead to flooding along coastal and low-lying areas.\n\nSanibel city spokesman Eric Jackson, citing widespread flooding across the Lee County island, urged people not to drive on flooded streets. Molly McCollum, a meteorologist with the Weather Channel, captured video of fish swimming on a street in downtown Sarasota.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expects a surge of water several feet high to come ashore along most of the western coast of Florida, with the highest level – 15 to 20 feet – projected to wallop the panhandle and Big Bend coast.\n\n– Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News; Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nCouple in their 80s decide to hunker down\n\nTaylor County Sheriff Sgt. Lee Harden's SUV pulled over Thursday at a home in the Steinhatchee coastal community, in the direct path of Hurricane Helene, after spotting a couple outside a home. Stan Ridgeway, 87, told the officer he's staying.\n\n\"I have to let you know ...\" Harden began, reciting the details about the expected surge. Ridgeway said he knew.\n\nLater, sitting in his living room, with his wife Jean, 81, Ridgeway said he bought his century-old house with its high elevation in mind. Floodwaters from Hurricane Idalia last year did not reach his home. Jean Ridgeway noted that this is the third hurricane since 2023.\n\n\"We didn't use to get hurricanes here,\" she said, then jokingly added: \"I think they discovered this place and they liked it.\"\n\nLesson learned, residents evacuate Horseshoe Beach\n\nHorseshoe Beach has become a ghost town ahead of Helene's anticipated landfall, the last few residents of the coastal community making final preparations before evacuating inland. The town was devastated by Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge. Or worse.\n\n\"We're just trying to get the heck out,\" Judy Paradis said as she and her husband, John, loaded their cars.\n\nAfter last year's experience, residents took the evacuation orders seriously, Judy said. The Paradises had just made Horseshoe Beach their permanent home last year after vacationing in the coastal town for several years. They said they have \"survivor's guilt\" because their elevated condo was spared when so many people lost everything.\n\n\"We try not to complain because we still have our home,\" John said.\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track outages as Hurricane Helene approaches from Gulf of Mexico\n\nSandbox sand pressed into service as storm approaches\n\nEmergency shipments of hurricane supplies have been flowing in all week at the Home Depot in Town ‘n’ Country, a community of more than 85,000 residents bordering the northern shore of Tampa Bay. By Thursday morning, the store’s supply of filled 50-pound sandbags had dwindled from 16 pallets to 3½ pallets, store manager Erica Jarmon said. In fact, those remaining bags were filled with play sand intended for children’s sandboxes.\n\n“Some customers are even using bags of soil out in the garden department. Getting creative – whatever kind of barriers they can actually use,” Jarmon said, standing alongside her remaining sandbags. Other hurricane supplies: included generators, gas cans, flashlights, sump pumps, extension cords, blue tarps, plywood and more, Jarmon said.\n\n“Fans are another big one, especially for mold, mildew, just trying to get any wet walls dried faster,\" Jarmon said. \"Bleach is another big one after the fact.\"\n\n− Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nLongtime resident listening to Helene warnings\n\nThe usually bustling Sea Hag Marina on Florida's targeted Big Bend coast was mostly deserted Thursday ahead of Helene. Bobbi Patterson, 85, was moving anything that could get soaked − rugs, chairs, a sofa − from her home on the Steinhatchee River to another one she owns across the street. Patterson planned to evacuate to a motel in Gainesville. Her daughter, Susan Merritt, 63, was helping.\n\nIn the 40 years Patterson has owned her riverfront bungalow, it's flooded twice. She said the media tends to overhype storms, but she's taking this one seriously. Still, she said she hates to think she and her daughter were hauling furniture across the street for nothing.\n\n\"It's pretty much stripped,\" she said of her home on the river. \"It better be something happens.\"\n\nKatrina survivors wary of Helene\n\nIf a house was built after 2004, according to Florida building code, it will be likely to withstand 115-mph winds. But if a home was built before 2004, Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie urged people to \"make decisions on solid information.\"\n\nWith catastrophic storm surge expected along Florida's coast, northern Gulf Coast residents Gene and Margaret Taylor understand better than anyone about the tragedy storm water can bring. As Hurricane Katrina approached in August 2005, the Taylor family fled their Gulf-front home in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, heading miles inland to his brother's home. The now-legendary hurricane pulverized their home and community with a record-breaking 28-foot-storm surge.\n\nGene Taylor first thought his bare street looked like it did \"when the French first arrived\" in Mississippi during the late 1600s. \"We could never have imagined the house would be gone,\" he recalled.

Was there scheming behind Will and Kate’s fairy-tale romance? Did the queen want to abdicate? How many bad decisions did Harry make?\n\nWe answer all your questions about Part 2 of the final season of “The Crown.\"\n\nHow did Will and Kate actually meet? Did they live in a group house together?\n\nThe series shows Will and Kate meeting by happenstance on the street when they are both teens and Diana is still alive. In reality, the future husband and wife met at St. Andrews University in Scotland when they were students there in 2001.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n​​\"I think you said I actually went bright red when I met you and sort of scuttled off,\" Kate recalled to Prince William during the interview in 2010 announcing their engagement. \"(I was) feeling very shy about meeting you.\"\n\nSimilar to how the series portrays, Will and Kate were friends first, and it took a long time for them to become romantically involved. They did move into a house together with a group of friends, like many other college kids do, in 2002, before they got together officially (the show portrays this happening afterward).\n\nDid Kate really catch Will's eye by walking in a risqué fashion show?\n\nThe fashion show and the see-through dress that “The Crown” depicts are both from Will and Kate’s real story, according to fellow St. Andrews alum and fashion designer Charlotte Todd, who designed the garment.\n\nTodd’s assignment was a fashion show called “The Art of Seduction,” “which is quite apt, really. I didn't know who Kate Middleton was and I didn't put her in it. It was just pure chance!\" she told People in 2020. Whether Kate picked the dress on purpose to catch Will’s eye, as “The Crown” portrays, we can’t know.\n\nThe dress sold at auction for $125,000 in 2011.\n\nDid Carole Middleton, Kate’s mother, plot to match her daughter with Prince William?\n\nIn one Season 6 episode, Kate accuses her mother (Eve Best) of scheming to put her in the path of the future king by suggesting the same gap year trip and pushing Kate to attend St. Andrews.\n\nRoyal correspondent Tina Brown suggests a similar narrative in her 2022 book “The Palace Papers.” Brown says Kate’s mother persuaded her daughter to go to St. Andrews instead of Edinburgh University and “strategized” with Kate on how to get Will back after the couple's brief breakup in 2007. However, like many royal scoops, the book does not include comment from the parties involved.\n\nDid Mohamed Al-Fayed accuse the British government and royal family of orchestrating Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed’s deaths? Was there a British inquest?\n\nAl-Fayed (Salim Daw) publicly supported conspiracy theories about the death of Diana and his son, Dodi, for years. There have been many inquiries into the car crash in the years since 1997, including an inquest from 2004 to 2006 by the London Metropolitan police that “The Crown” dramatizes (slightly out of the chronology).\n\nHow 'The Crown' ends on Netflix:Does it get to Harry and Meghan? Or the queen's death?\n\nDid young Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret sneak out of Buckingham Palace to celebrate VE Day at the end of World War II?\n\nIn an emotional episode chronicling Princess Margaret's (Lesley Manville) death, \"The Crown\" flashes back all the way to the 1940s. It shows young Elizabeth (Viola Prettejohn) and Margaret (Beau Gadsdon) escaping the palace to celebrate Victory in Europe Day, the day World War II ended on the continent. They both let loose in the anonymity of the jubilant crowds, with Elizabeth swing dancing in an underground jazz club.\n\nRoyal historian Hugo Vickers says this is partially true. \"The princesses went out into the crowds on VE night,\" he says. But it was \"with a group of escorts and with the full knowledge of the king.\"\n\nDid Will and Kate endorse Prince Harry's Nazi costume for a ‘Colonials and Natives’ party?\n\nIn 2005, Prince Harry was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform as a costume at a “Colonials and Natives”-themed party. It was a monumental scandal around the world and required profuse apologies and penance from the then-20-year-old.\n\nBut why did he wear the costume in the first place? It depends on whom you ask.\n\nIn “The Crown,” Harry goes to a costume shop with Will and Kate and suggests the Nazi costume. Kate is apprehensive, worried it’s offensive. Will is more positive and says that wearing it doesn’t make him a Nazi and that it’s a joke.\n\nIn his 2023 memoir, “Spare,” Prince Harry claims he was egged on by Will and Kate to wear the outfit. \"I phoned Willy and Kate, asked what they thought. Nazi uniform,\" Harry wrote. \"They both howled. Worse than Willy's leotard outfit! Way more ridiculous! Which, again, was the point.\"\n\nThe cast:Who plays William, Kate, Diana and the queen in 'The Crown'? See Season 6, Part 2 cast\n\nDid the queen really consider abdicating around the time of Charles and Camilla’s wedding?\n\nThe finale episode of \"The Crown\" has Elizabeth contemplating her mortality and the future of the monarchy as her courtiers plan her funeral and her son Charles prepares to marry for the second time. Elizabeth has debates with herself − literally, as the actresses who played her in previous seasons (Olivia Colman and Claire Foy) return to play her inner conscience − about whether she should continue reigning into her even older age. Ultimately she decides not to abdicate, and the series ends with her walking out of a church, confident in her decision.\n\nBut did any of that really happen (minus the ghosts of queen actresses past)? The private thoughts of the queen are hard to confirm or deny. But royal historians and biographers have been adamant for years that the queen never seriously considered abdication. \"As an anointed queen, she could not do so,\" Vickers says. \"Had she been unable to fulfill her duties, a regent would have been appointed, as happened when George III fell ill (in the 1800s).\"\n\n'The Crown' Season 6 Part 1 fact check:Did Dodi Fayed really propose to Princess Diana?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/04/busy-beaches-open-malls-mask-frustration-news-around-states/111656722/", "title": "Busy beaches, open malls: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A lawsuit filed Friday challenges the state’s election procedures by arguing that restrictions on absentee ballots and a lack of other voting methods jeopardize the health of voters – especially older voters, black voters and voters with disabilities – during the coronavirus outbreak. The lawsuit filed by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program alleges that Alabama’s rules will require people to choose between voting and protecting their health. Alabama absentee voters are currently required to submit photocopies of their photo identification as well as sign the absentee ballot before a notary or two witnesses. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to waive those mandates and also force the state to offer curbside voting. “No one should have to choose between their life or their vote,” LDF Senior Counsel Deuel Ross said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Organizers of the Southeast Alaska State Fair say the summer event in Haines has been canceled this year due to COVID-19. In a statement, fair officials said it was a difficult decision but the right one to make. “For us and many across Southeast Alaska and the Yukon, the Fair is something to look forward to at the end of the summer, a moment of congregation and fun separate from the rest of the year,” the statement said. “2020 has instead united us with the common goal of preserving the health and safety of loved ones and strangers alike.” Meanwhile, the state Department of Public Safety said it will not hold a ceremony next week to honor law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty, but a remembrance would be recorded and shared. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a release, encouraged Alaskans to visit local memorials, while practicing social distancing.\n\nArizona\n\nWickenburg: Two restaurants in this central Arizona community that allowed people to eat in the establishments in violation of an order issued by the governor to help stop the spread of the coronavirus will be reported to the town attorney for a decision on possible citations, police said Saturday. Police Lt. Kenny Lutkiewicz said both establishments that will be reported based on officers’ observations Saturday were presented copies Friday of Gov. Doug Ducey’s order barring dine-in eating during the coronavirus pandemic. Nobody was arrested or issued a citation Saturday, Lutkiewicz said. “Our goal is to educate,” he said. Lutkiewicz said there were strong feelings in the community about enforcement of Ducey’s order. People crowded sidewalks and were inside several restaurants that were open for business Saturday, said Jack Howell, a Wickenburg resident who observed the scene. “Everybody was well mannered … but there was no social distancing,” Howell said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two state prisoners died from the illness caused by the coronavirus, health officials said Saturday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson urged residents to “tip very generously” when businesses shuttered due to the virus reopen in the coming days. The two inmates, both in their 60s, were from the Cummins Unit, where at least 860 prisoners have tested positive. Health officials announced the deaths as the state prepared to start rolling back its coronavirus restrictions this week, with gyms opening Monday. Restaurants can reopen their dining rooms May 11, but only at one-third their capacity. Hair salons, barbershops, tattoo shops and massage therapists can reopen Wednesday with new rules on customer interaction. Hutchinson said he hoped Arkansans would spend money at the businesses but follow the social distancing measures such as wearing a mask.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAntioch: A city official has been ousted after he suggested on social media that sick, old and homeless people should be left to meet their “natural course in nature” during the coronavirus pandemic. City council members in Antioch, a city of about 110,000 people 35 miles east of Oakland, voted unanimously Friday night to remove Ken Turnage II from his post as chairman of the city’s planning commission. NBC Bay Area reports there was a swift uproar after Turnage characterized people with weak immune systems as a drain on society. He wrote on Facebook: “the World has been introduced to a new phrase Herd Immunity which is a good one. In my opinion we need to adapt a Herd Mentality. A herd gathers it ranks, it allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature.” As for homeless people, he added that the virus would “fix what is a significant burden on our society and resources that can be used.” Turnage later deleted the post but refused to resign or back down from his comments.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Getting a haircut and shopping in person at retail stores were allowed again in much of the state starting Friday as Colorado continued to ease restrictions set up to stop the rapid spread of the coronavirus. However, stay-at-home orders remained in place for much of the Denver area, with only essential businesses like grocery, liquor and hardware stores open there. Goodwill was reopening 16 stores around Colorado with changes to protect people’s safety. Dressing rooms will be closed, and one-way aisles have been set up to make it easier for customers to stay 6 feet apart. Elective surgeries and curbside pickup at retail shops were allowed to begin outside the Denver area Monday in the first wave of the relaxation of restrictions under Democratic Gov. Jared Polis’ “safer at home” order. Offices can reopen starting Monday but only with half the usual staff to allow for social distancing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Beautiful spring weather brought people out to state parks Saturday, forcing officials to close many that became too crowded under the state’s guidelines for social distancing. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection had closed at least 11 parks because their parking areas were at capacity. Officials had urged residents to seek out lesser-used parks to avoid crowding. Among the parks to reach capacity were Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, Wadsworth Falls State Park in Middletown and Talcott Mountain State Park in Simsbury. The DEEP has implemented lower capacity limits at parks to support social distancing. It says that the closures are temporary and that parks can be expected to open the following day.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Police say Gov. John Carney’s order requiring people to wear face coverings in public during the coronavirus pandemic is mostly being observed, but not everyone has been willing to comply. In Cheswold, a Valero patron who was rebuffed by a clerk for not wearing a mask kicked and shattered a glass door Tuesday. The Delaware State News reports multiple other police departments and businesses said most people were complying with the order. Delaware State Police spokeswoman Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe said a person who continues to refuse management requests to leave a business could possibly be charged with third-degree trespassing or disorderly conduct. Jaffe said there are exceptions, such as if someone has a medical condition that precludes them from wearing a face covering.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Amid the fight against coronavirus, city leaders plan to hire at least 200 additional people to join the Contact Trace Force and investigate local cases of the illness, WUSA-TV reports. Contact tracers play a key role in stopping the spread of a virus by speaking with people who have tested positive and figuring out with whom they have come in contact. “For us, it means that we get to it faster, and we contain it faster,” D.C. Department of Human Resources Director Ventris Gibson said. “You contain the spread by making sure you pull the group together that had the exposure.” Currently, the city’s trace force has 65 members. By hiring 200 additional members, Gibson said, the city could get an even bigger hold on the virus. “We are doing this to save lives, to save hospitalizations and to get us back to a healthy state,” she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Deputies arrested a man who had been living out his quarantine on a shuttered Disney World island, telling authorities it felt like a “tropical paradise.” Orange County Sheriff’s deputies found Richard McGuire on Disney’s Discovery Island on Thursday. He said he’d been there since Monday or Tuesday and had planned to camp there for a week, according to an arrest report. The 42-year-old said he didn’t hear numerous deputies searching the private island for him on foot, by boat and by air because he was asleep in a building. He told the deputy he didn’t know it was a restricted area, despite there being numerous “no trespassing” signs. A security representative for Disney said she saw McGuire using a company boat Thursday. She asked the agency to press charges. McGuire was arrested on a trespassing charge and taken to jail without incident.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians gathered in small groups atop parking decks, on rooftop patios and along normally busy interstates to see U.S. military fighter jets that flew over the Atlanta metro area in a tribute to health care workers battling the coronavirus. Spectators cheered loudly as the U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels and the Air Force Thunderbirds roared overhead Saturday afternoon. The jets flew in formation as they passed over the area’s major hospitals. At the historic Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, spectators generally adhered to social distancing guidelines, but few wore masks. Some carried lawn chairs and beverages while others pushed strollers. Statewide, two dozen more deaths of people with COVID-19 were reported Saturday by the Georgia Department of Public Health, bringing the state’s death toll to at least 1,174.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lt. Gov. Josh Green said Friday that the state is moving into “Phase 2” of its effort against the coronavirus now that it has successfully reduced the rate of new infections and “flattened the curve.” Green said in a video posted on social media that low-risk activities like elective medical procedures are resuming, and officials in the next few weeks will consider authorizing medium-risk activities. “Can our gyms open? Can restaurants that do social distancing open? That’s what we’re working on,” Green said. The next step after these activities would be “higher-risk stuff” like large gatherings of people and bars, he said. Gov. David Ige has extended the state’s stay-at-home order through May 31. A 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving in the state also remains in effect.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Three northern Idaho residents have filed a federal lawsuit challenging statewide restrictions ordered by Gov. Brad Little due to the coronavirus, saying it violates their religious freedoms. Two religious leaders and a churchgoer filed the lawsuit Thursday against Little and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen. The lawsuit targets Little’s stay-at-home order as unconstitutional and specifically cites restrictions on religious gatherings. That order expired Thursday and was replaced by one that allows church gatherings but still requires social distancing. But attorneys said Friday that the remaining restrictions on churches remain unconstitutional and that they plan to request a temporary restraining order to have them lifted. They also said they’re concerned Little could reinstate the stay-at-home order should Idaho see a spike in infections and deaths due to the virus.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarion: A group of award-winning barbecue restaurants in southern Illinois is coming together to provide meals for health care employees and other workers battling on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The Hands of Hope foundation will collaborate with the eateries through a program called Operation BBQ’d Hope to provide meals for about 4,000 people at Heartland Regional Medical Center, Herrin Hospital, St. Joseph Memorial Hospital and Memorial Hospital of Carbondale. The group served its first meal last Tuesday at Heartland, The Southern Illinoisan reports. More meals are planned for Tuesday in Murphysboro and Thursday in Carbondale. The barbecue caterers raised money to fund the dinners, and the foundation provided the proteins and main ingredients. The restaurants share their knowledge, in addition to staples such as salt, sugar and spices. Volunteers prepare desserts.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb announced Friday the steps toward relaxing business and activity restrictions imposed to slow the coronavirus spread for much of the state, allowing more manufacturers, retailers and shopping malls to open their doors, starting Monday, under health and social distancing guidelines. The Republican governor’s plan aims to gradually ease rules with the goal of allowing nearly all activities to resume July 4, potentially opening the way for major summer events such as the rescheduled Indianapolis 500 on Aug. 23. The new directive lifts travel restrictions under the statewide stay-at-home order that took effect March 25 but doesn’t allow restaurants to resume in-person dining or hair salon reopenings for another week. Fitness centers, movie theaters, bars and casinos are among businesses that will remain closed until at least late May.\n\nIowa\n\nWhiting: A couple who have been married for nearly 70 years are back home after they both recovered from bouts of COVID-19. Bert McCandless, 88, and his 89-year-old wife, Ardis, contracted the illness caused by the coronavirus in March, The Omaha World-Herald reports. They were hospitalized at Creighton University Medical Center-Bergan Mercy, where Bert nearly didn’t make it. Ardis spent three days in the hospital in late March, but as she started to get better, Bert’s condition worsened. He was placed on a ventilator for two weeks, and doctors estimated he had no better than a 20% chance of surviving. On April 24, though, Bert returned to the couple’s home in Whiting, where Ardis was so happy she climbed onto his lap. “She hasn’t done that in 30 years,” Bert said. “So I must be a hot commodity.” Both are still recovering, but they’re busy gardening and visiting with grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state began releasing inmates last week as a way to check the spread of coronavirus in its prison system, but it stopped when an outbreak created a danger of returning infected offenders to their communities, Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday. Kelly said the Department of Corrections released only six inmates and put them under house arrest for the rest of their sentences. But confirmed coronavirus cases at the Lansing Correctional Facility have skyrocketed, and the prison is under quarantine. “We got the testing results at Lansing and realized that we had some other work to do before we could let anybody else go,” Kelly said. The Department of Corrections said none of the six released were from Lansing. Problems at the prison didn’t prevent Kelly from promising to lift a statewide stay-at-home order as planned at midnight Sunday or outlining a plan to gradually reopen the state’s coronavirus-battered economy by June 15, starting with restaurants and many other businesses Monday. However, her economic plan frustrated some business owners, who won’t be allowed to reopen until at least May 18 while others can.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A federal appeals court on Saturday declined to block the governor’s temporary ban on mass gatherings from applying to in-person religious services. The three-judge panel did clear the way for Maryville Baptist Church to hold drive-in worship services while adhering to public health requirements. That’s an alternative that Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has strongly encouraged throughout the coronavirus pandemic. But the panel stopped short of applying its order to in-person worship services. The Cincinnati-based appeals court panel urged a federal district judge to “prioritize resolution” of the church’s claims in its lawsuit. Beshear recently announced that places of worship in Kentucky will be able to once again hold in-person services starting May 20 as part of a broader plan to gradually reopen the state’s economy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards says he doesn’t foresee armed protesters disrupting lawmakers when a coronavirus-interrupted legislative session resumes Monday. Speaking at a news conference Friday, the Democratic governor noted that, unlike in some other states, visitors in Louisiana aren’t allowed to bring firearms into the state Capitol. “Obviously we have some individuals around the state who want to give voice to their opinions, which are different than mine at the moment, with respect to the necessity of the stay-at-home order,” Edwards said. “I would ask those individuals to do that in an appropriate and safe manner. If they do that, then there won’t be any problems like you saw in Michigan” – where hundreds of protesters, many without face coverings and some openly carrying guns, entered the state’s Capitol on Thursday in opposition to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s restrictions put in place because of the pandemic.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills acknowledged the pace of restarting the economy was testing people’s patience Friday as an angry restaurant owner openly defied her executive orders by reopening his restaurant for the day. Mills assured people she’s listening to their concerns but warned there won’t be unanimous agreement on everything as she grapples with the safest path forward during a pandemic. The first phase of reopening the state began Friday with restrictions lifted on the use of golf courses; visits to the dentist, barbers and hairdressers; and stay-in-your-vehicle religious services. Mainers also were required to begin wearing masks when social distancing isn’t possible. But a restaurateur in Bethel used the megaphone of an appearance on Fox News Channel to criticize the governor, claiming she was going “rogue” and wasn’t listening to business owners. Rick Savage openly shared what he said was the governor’s cellphone number live on TV.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Several dozen residents demonstrated against Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order Saturday by caravaning across the state. A group known as “ReOpen Maryland” organized the protest against the governor’s mandates for social distancing and other measures designed to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,100 people in the state. Hogan has also ordered the closure of all nonessential businesses. “We should’ve had the opportunity to adhere to certain rules and regulations rather than be shut down,” James Knowles, a Queen Anne’s resident, told The Baltimore Sun during a lunch stop in Kent Island during Saturday’s protest. Protesters made several stops as they drove from Frederick to Salisbury. Group members pledged to follow social distancing guidelines by remaining in their cars, but many did not.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDartmouth: A group of about 10 federal immigration detainees who refused to be tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 caused extensive damage to the center where they are being held, the sheriff’s office said in a release. The inmates involved in the incident at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center reported multiple symptoms of COVID-19, and when told they had to be tested, they rushed officers. A news release from the Bristol County sheriff said the detainees barricaded themselves inside the facility, ripped washing machines and pipes off the wall, broke windows and “trashed the entire unit.” A special response team restrained the detainees, the department said. One detainee was hospitalized with “symptoms of a panic attack,” another due to a preexisting condition and a third “for a medical incident after being removed from the ICE wing.” All three are expected “to be fine,” the sheriff’s department said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The governor said gun-carrying protesters who demonstrated inside her state’s Capitol “depicted some of the worst racism” and “awful parts” of U.S. history. Democrat Gretchen Whitmer told CNN that the protests featured “Confederate flags and nooses,” as well as swastikas. Members of the Michigan Liberty Militia protested the state’s stay-at-home orders last week, some with weapons and tactical gear and their faces partially covered. They went inside the Capitol, where being armed is allowed, then demanded access to the House floor, which is prohibited. Some went to the Senate gallery, where a senator said armed men shouted at her. The Republican-controlled Legislature has questioned Whitmer’s authority to extend stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the governor used an executive order to extend a state of emergency declaration and has directed most businesses statewide to remain closed. “This is a public health crisis,” she said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State House Republicans have vowed to block Gov. Tim Walz’s proposal to borrow money for public construction projects unless the Democrat ends his COVID-19 emergency powers. House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, a Republican from Crown, said Saturday that it is “important that the Legislature be involved in the decision-making process” about how to address the coronavirus pandemic. “The Legislature is in session,” Daudt told the Star Tribune. “We believe we should be working with the governor on the response to COVID-19 and keeping Minnesota safe.” Walz declared a “peacetime emergency” March 13 aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19. The declaration, set to end May 13, gave Walz the power to close schools and businesses. Last week, Walz extended the stay-at-home order to May 18, while loosening some restrictions on retailers to allow them to reopen for curbside pickup and deliveries starting Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Friday and asserted their control in a power struggle with the governor over who has the authority to spend $1.25 billion the state is receiving from the federal government for coronavirus relief. Republicans who lead the House and Senate say the Mississippi Constitution gives spending authority to the Legislature. But Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has said a state law enacted 40 years ago gives the governor some spending power during emergencies. The House and Senate each voted by wide bipartisan margins to pass the same bill, which puts most of the federal relief money into a fund the Legislature controls. The governor would still need to agree to spending plans that lawmakers set. Reeves would not immediately say whether he will veto the proposal but said legislators were tying the hands of people responding to the pandemic, including the state health officer and the state emergency management director. “You care more about power than people,” Reeves said of lawmakers.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A team of teachers is collaborating with the University of Missouri to develop a high school curriculum about the new coronavirus pandemic to teach to students while schools are closed. Pat Friedrichsen, a professor of science education at MU, was awarded a $200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to help create a coronavirus curriculum aimed at informing Missouri high schoolers on the science of the pandemic and its effects on everyday life. “I think it’s really difficult for teenagers,” Friedrichsen said. “They’re very social. They want to be with their friends. And so we wanted them to understand why this policy is going to help us flatten the curve.” The team of teachers at MU uses online modeling tools to create and teach lessons about the virus. “Let’s say 20% of your population is physically distancing,” Friedrichsen offered as an example. “What does that do to your infection curve versus if 80% of people do this?”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A task force appointed by Gov. Steve Bullock to make recommendations for how the state should spend $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief funding presented its guidance Friday, starting with immediate grants for “safety net” services such as food banks and homeless shelters, along with rent and mortgage assistance for individuals and nonprofits. The 20-member Coronavirus Relief Fund Advisory Council did not make specific monetary recommendations but outlined spending priorities to aid individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations, said council chairman Larry Simkins with The Washington Cos. The advisory council recommended prioritizing funding based on those who are affected the most and those who did not receive funding elsewhere, as well as deploying the funding quickly through existing channels such as economic development agencies, lending institutions or state programs, the report said.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: A mall that pitched itself as a case study for how to reopen safely welcomed customers Friday for the first time since closing because of the coronavirus pandemic. Fewer than a dozen customers were at Nebraska Crossing when it opened 11 of its more than 80 stores at 11 a.m. Those who were there wore masks and wandered the open-air mall’s mostly empty pathways, stopping at times to peek into shop windows. The opening coincided with other malls in the state allowing customers to return Friday, including Lincoln’s Gateway Mall and Omaha’s Westroads Mall. Nebraska Crossing resumed business with new safety measures in place, including signs to promote social distancing guidelines and Plexiglas barriers in restaurants. All but one of the entrances were taped off. Mall officials faced criticism for deciding to reopen before the virus was contained.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A newly formed state Department of Education committee has been tasked with helping develop a plan and guidelines for school districts and charter schools to reopen for the 2020-2021 academic year. State Superintendent Jhone Ebert said the committee includes school district superintendents, health officials and safety experts. Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered Nevada schools in March to close because of the coronavirus outbreak. Sisolak directed that schools continue operations during the current school year by providing distance learning to students. Ebert said that has raised challenges that include access to technology, training teachers and quality instructional materials. A newly formed educational collaborative will use federal assistance to bolster distance learning capabilities, Ebert said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday extended the state’s stay-at-home order to May 31 while allowing the restricted reopening of restaurants, hair salons and other businesses throughout the month. “We’re not taking giant leaps forward. We’re just not at that point, but we do want to provide the opportunity to flex some of these things open, and we think it’s a great first step,” he said at a news conference. The state issued guidelines for all businesses on screening of employees, workplace cleaning and other practices to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus. Campgrounds, already allowed to operate under previous orders, are now limited to 50% capacity, and out-of-state visitors are prohibited unless they are members of a private campground. Golf courses also will be limited to residents and members when allowed to reopen May 11. Ocean beaches will remain closed, while state parks can open with some restrictions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nIsland Beach State Park: Nearly everyone seemed to cooperate at a sprawling oceanfront park Saturday as New Jersey reopened its state parks to a populace itching to get sand between their toes after months of being cooped up due to the coronavirus outbreak. Island Beach State Park in Ocean County was among the parks to reopen, drawing several hundred people to a beach that routinely handles thousands during the summer. In the four hours that an Associated Press reporter watched the crowd, almost all complied with a requirement that they stay at least 6 feet apart to prevent the spread of the virus. A small group of people wearing Rutgers T-shirts over their swimsuits reclined on towels 6 inches apart instead of 6 feet. And a few people saw friends on the beach, went up to them and hugged. Still, more than half wore masks, even as strong sunshine bore down. Gov. Phil Murphy said he was pleased with initial reports from sites that reopened Saturday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state’s Riot Control Act on Friday as she sealed off all roads to nonessential traffic in one of the largest communities bordering the Navajo Nation, where a surging coronavirus outbreak has already prompted widespread restrictions and weekend lockdowns. She also required that businesses in Gallup close from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. in the city of about 20,000 people along Interstate 40, which remained open to through traffic. Gallup is a hub for basic household supplies, liquor sales and water-container refills for people living in remote stretches of the Navajo Nation – often without full indoor plumbing – and indigenous Zuni Pueblo. The Navajo Nation has imposed evening and weekend curfews on the reservation. COVID-19 infection rates in Gallup and surrounding McKinley County make it one of the worst U.S. hot spots for the pandemic as patients overwhelm intensive care facilities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers were mostly adhering to social distancing rules while outside enjoying the warmest weekend in a spring clouded by the coronavirus crisis, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday. “The big story here is what New Yorkers have done right,” de Blasio said. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the city’s parks and public spaces Saturday as temperatures hit the low 70s. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said officers issued 51 summonses Saturday, including 43 in parks. Shea said he was aware of three arrests. Police had to break up some large gatherings and stop people from playing team sports, which are still banned. Officers were also handing out face masks, which people are required to wear when social distancing is not possible. “The vast majority of New Yorkers have really risen to the challenge,” de Blasio said, though he and Shea acknowledged some hiccups. De Blasio said he also asked police to increase patrols Sunday in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park after crowding issues there Saturday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Several major shopping malls in the state are expected to reopen on the same day Gov. Roy Cooper’s COVID-19 stay-at-home order is scheduled to end. The News & Observer reports Simon Property Group announced it plans to reopen the SouthPark and Concord Mills malls and Charlotte Premium Outlets on Friday. Simon is the largest mall operator in the U.S. Its other North Carolina property, Carolina Premium Outlets in Smithfield, is also set to open Friday. The planned reopenings are based on “current state and/or local stay-at-home or closure orders, which are subject to change,” according to a statement on Simon’s website. The mall operator said all employees will be required to wear masks and take hand-washing breaks. The malls will also limit entrances, hours and the number of people in the buildings. Chairs in dining areas will be removed, and drinking fountains and play areas will be closed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota High School Activities Association is canceling spring sports, fine arts and other state contests because of the coronavirus. The vote Friday by the group’s board of directors came after Gov. Doug Burgum’s order to keep schools closed and continue with distance learning for the rest of the academic year. The move also put an end to hopes of completing the Class A boys and girls basketball tournaments and the Class B boys basketball tournament. Board president Scott Privratsky cited social distancing guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and said the “health and safety” of those involved was the key factor in calling off the events. “This difficult conclusion did not come easy, as we understand the huge sacrifices students have made,” Privratsky said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Reopening the state is a “balancing” act between bringing the economy back and protecting people, Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday, noting that he will be prepared to take action should the situation worsen again. State officials are monitoring the data on coronavirus in Ohio “every single day,” DeWine said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” On Friday, the Republican governor extended the state shutdown until May 29 while also allowing retail stores to expand their business earlier than expected. Construction companies, distributors, manufacturers and offices are allowed to reopen Monday and retail businesses May 12. Health care offices were allowed to reopen Friday. DeWine issued an order for people to wear face coverings in stores but quickly reversed himself, calling it a strong recommendation but not a requirement. He said Sunday the order “went too far” because “people were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state went into its first weekend of a reopened economy during the coronavirus pandemic as residents were allowed to return to restaurants, mall and other stores. Tempers flared in some parts of the state over restrictions still in place. In Stillwater, city officials on Friday amended a local emergency declaration after businesses reported being threatened by customers who didn’t want to be forced to wear masks to enter. The changes now make masks optional for customers instead of mandatory, although they are still strongly recommended. Employees are still required to wear them. “Store employees have been threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse,” Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement. “It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state will launch an ambitious COVID-19 testing program and increase contact tracing as it prepares to reopen the economy, Gov. Kate Brown said Friday. People will be chosen at random for testing and asked to volunteer in a partnership with Oregon Health & Science University. The governor also said some rural counties where there are almost no cases could begin reopening slowly starting May 15. “This program is a game-changer,” Brown said. “It will give us a more accurate understanding of the true rate of infections in Oregon and to have ongoing precision monitoring of any new outbreaks.” Officials have said Oregon needs the ability to conduct 12,250 tests a week, for a rate of 29 per 10,000 people. That level would have to increase as stay-home orders are eased. In recent weeks, COVID-19 testing has increased to more than 9,000 tests\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Hundreds of protesters chanted and carried signs outside the governor’s home to protest his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and call for an end to restrictions on business activity. About 100 to 200 people paced along the street Saturday afternoon outside Gov. Tom Wolf’s house in York, repeatedly chanting “open up” toward the house. Members of the governor’s security team wouldn’t comment on whether Wolf was home. “Open the doors as of Monday,” Joyce Cordell of Hamlin, Wayne County said from a motorized cart. “It’s not right to keep us closed up.” Her county was not among the two dozen of the state’s 67 counties that will have some restrictions eased May 8, although it had 105 cases and a handful of deaths. Karen Bosco, a 62-year-old retired safety consultant from York Haven, said the governor is “killing small business.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Brown University student has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Ivy League school seeking reimbursement for tuition, room, board and other expenses associated with the campus closure in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The suit filed Thursday in federal court in Providence alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment on the part of the school. “College students enrolled in classes when the COVID-19 outbreak struck were left with no access to their dorms, to classrooms, campus cafeterias or other facilities they paid to use,” Steve Berman, an attorney for the students, said in a statement. “We believe there’s absolutely no reason why they should continue to be stuck holding the bill for tens of thousands of dollars, only to be kicked off campus.” An email seeking comment was sent to a Brown spokesman.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People flocked to state parks and beaches Saturday as the state prepared to end its coronavirus stay-at-home order. The parks were reopened Friday after more than a month, and many reported full parking lots. Picnic shelters, playgrounds and interpretive museums remain closed, and rangers required social distancing and other protective measures. Webcams of beaches showed hundreds of people sunbathing, tossing footballs or playing in the surf along the Grand Strand on Saturday, a day after hotels along the beach were allowed to reopen for people with existing reservations. But the number of cases keeps climbing. South Carolina is also starting to see hot spots in state prisons. Thirty-one inmates are infected with COVID-19, all at Allendale Correctional Institution or the Kirkland Correctional Institution, where all new inmates are brought, the Corrections Department said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Smithfield Foods’ troubled location in the city will partially reopen Monday after being closed for more than two weeks, according to the workers’ union. The meatpacking plant asked about 250 employees to report to its Sioux Falls plant Monday to staff two departments – ground seasoned pork and night cleanup, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union local. The plant has been closed for more than two weeks after an outbreak infected 853 of its 3,100 workers. Meanwhile, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is looking into worker complaints that the plant operated under unsafe conditions. The complaint filed April 20 was first reported by inforum.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toured the facility April 15 and recommended several changes to reduce crowding and improve health and safety.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Gov. Bill Lee issued guidelines Friday for places of worship to operate, as the state moves forward with reopening locations where people can gather during the response to the new coronavirus outbreak. The new statewide recommendations contradict stricter rules issued Thursday by officials in Memphis, who now say places of worship should follow Lee’s guidelines instead. Lee said places of worship across the state should hold services under certain limitations, such as asking congregants to remain 6 feet apart and wear face coverings. Gathering rooms should only be used at 50% capacity, and people who are over 65 or have underlying illnesses should not attend services. Lee had earlier recommended that people avoid church gatherings, but he never mandated it. His new guidelines recommend for a “phased-in” process to increase access to places of worship.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in the state surpassed 1,000 for the fourth consecutive day Sunday, and the number of deaths increased by at least 20. State health officials reported 31,548 confirmed cases, an increase from 30,522 reported Saturday, and 867 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest that people can be infected without showing symptoms. This past weekend was the first of the state’s reopening the economy after Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide “stay-at-home” order for nearly 30 million people expired Friday. Residents were allowed to go back to malls, restaurants, movie theaters and retail stores in limited numbers, although some protests of the closings continued.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Officials at Zion National Park announced Saturday that they planned to reopen the park May 13, although they emphasized that it would only open in “select areas.” The most-visited of Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks, Zion was closed April 3 after Gov. Gary Herbert and the state’s top health officials requested it. Local officials, including the mayor and town council of the gateway community of Springdale, had written to park officials asking for the closure as well. The vast majority of Zion’s 4 million-plus visitors each year make use of its main canyon, where attractions like Angels Landing, the Zion Narrows and the Zion Canyon Lodge attract thousands of hikers each day. The park saw more than 370,000 visitors during April 2019, with the warm-but-not-hot weather and seasonal occasions like spring break and Easter weekend helping to generate some of the largest crowds of the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMarshfield: Gov. Phil Scott announced more gradual steps Friday to reopen the state’s pandemic-stricken economy by expanding the number of employees allowed to work at a manufacturing, construction and distribution business from five to 10 if the workers follow safety requirements. “I’m pleased to say we’re able to get thousands more Vermonters back to work starting Monday,” the Republican governor said. The workers must stay 6 feet apart and be screened, including for their body temperature, at the start of their shift, and they must wear cloth face coverings around others. Those businesses may expand to full operation May 11 if they comply with “additional, stringent” requirements, Scott said. But he warned that the state, which has seen relatively few cases of the coronavirus, must remain vigilant and recognize that other states nearby are still dealing with massive outbreaks. Scott also announced Friday a new requirement that public transit employees and customers must wear cloth masks.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state will receive three decontamination systems that can collectively sterilize up to 240,000 units of personal protective equipment each day during the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Saturday. Northam said in a news release that the decontamination systems will become operational in Blacksburg, Newport News and Chesterfield County within the next week. The units were approved for Virginia by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Northam said the technology will help address the national shortage of critical personal protective equipment to help protect health care workers and first responders working on the front lines of the pandemic. The system uses a concentrated hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate N95 masks.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Yakima County has the highest rate of coronavirus cases of any county on the West Coast. Health experts point to a large number of essential workers, a large number of cases in long-term care facilities, and a large agricultural workforce living and working in close quarters as the causes. The county has about 250,000 residents. “We just haven’t been as much down as the rest of the state because our workforce is going to work,” said Lilian Bravo, a spokeswoman for the Yakima Health District. “Physically going to work every day is going to put you at a higher risk than others.” As of Friday, Yakima County had 1,203 positive cases, a rate of 455 cases per 100,000 residents, the highest in the state. Second was Franklin County at 326 cases per 100,000. The statewide average was 185 cases per 100,000 residents. Yakima County, 140 miles southeast of Seattle, also had a relatively high number of deaths from coronavirus with 47.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Monday marks the second week of Gov. Jim Justice’s plan to push the state’s economy forward in response to the coronavirus. The governor’s plan includes the reopening of small businesses with fewer than 10 employees, restaurants with outdoor seating, barbershops and dog groomers. Physical distancing will be required. Last week, hospitals were allowed to resume elective medical procedures, while other services were allowed to reopen, including primary care physician and dental offices and physical and psychological therapy. Starting May 11, other businesses may be allowed to reopen based on available testing data. Those businesses include office and government buildings, specialty retail stores, dine-in restaurants, parks, casinos, gyms, and fitness and recreation centers.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it will hear oral arguments early this week in a lawsuit seeking to block Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order. The justices ruled 6-1 to accept the case and scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday morning via video conference. The arguments are expected to last at least 90 minutes. The ruling said the court will consider whether the order was really an administrative rule and whether Palm was within her rights to issue it unilaterally. Even if the order doesn’t qualify as a rule, the court said it will still weigh whether state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm exceeded her authority by “closing all “nonessential” businesses, ordering all Wisconsin persons to stay home and forbidding all “nonessential travel.” Conservatives hold a 5-2 majority on the court.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Two days after the state’s top health official loosened restrictions on businesses, at least two counties have already moved to further change the strictures on their communities. Park and Teton counties are on opposite ends of the coronavirus pandemic in Wyoming. Park has just one case, despite the virus’s early presence in the county. Teton, meanwhile, has 65 cases, the most per 100,000 people in the state. Earlier this week, Dr. Alexia Harrist allowed barbershops, tattoo parlors, gyms and select other businesses to open with restrictions; as part of that change Friday, various counties can make their own orders. Both Park and Teton counties have applied for changes that would allow them to address the pandemic in their areas, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Teton County wants the businesses that the state said could reopen Friday to instead be ordered closed through May 11. The request from the county has been approved, officials said. Park County’s health officer, Dr. Aaron Billin, told the Star-Tribune the county was asking the state for permission to allow for outdoor, in-person dining at restaurants there.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/18/unlimited-free-testing-canyon-roaming-beach-crowds-news-around-states/111793148/", "title": "Unlimited free testing, Canyon roaming: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus neared 500 on Saturday. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported there have been more than 11,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state and at least 485 deaths. That’s 12 more deaths than were reported Friday. Three counties – Mobile, Jefferson and Montgomery – accounted for 41% of all case growth in the last day. Meanwhile, the annual Memorial Day celebration at Veterans Memorial Park in Tuscaloosa has been canceled. PARA and the Veterans Memorial Park Association said there are plans to hold a joint Memorial Day/Veteran’s Day celebration in November. And in Auburn, city officials are working on a phased plan to reopen all city facilities by June 1. The move comes a few days after Opelika city officials announced they will open all city buildings Monday, under new guidelines to limit exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state lawmaker on Friday defended asking whether stickers that individuals may be asked to wear as part of a Capitol coronavirus screening process will be “available as a yellow Star of David.” Republican Rep. Ben Carpenter of Nikiski said he was serious in making the comment in an email chain with other legislators. He was responding to proposed protocols aimed at guarding against the virus as lawmakers prepared to reconvene Monday. The protocols suggest stickers be worn to confirm someone at the Capitol had been screened. “The point is, tying it to the Star of David shows, who amongst the human population has lost their liberties more than the Jewish people?” he said in an interview. “And if there were more people standing up for the loss of liberties prior to World War II, maybe we wouldn’t have had the Holocaust.” Rep. Grier Hopkins, a Fairbanks Democrat, responded by calling the remark “disgusting. Keep your Holocaust jokes to yourself.”\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Tourists appeared ready to roam Grand Canyon National Park again after it partially reopened Friday, despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying viewpoints along the South Rim. Among them were friends Jack Covington from Texas and Judy Smith from Tucson. They had planned their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago since Covington had never seen it. They changed their plans and were visiting other places in northern Arizona when they found out the park would be open. “We figured we’d go for an adventure, and we got lucky,” Smith said. The Grand Canyon had been closed since April 1, one of the last big national parks to shut down completely to visitors. At the time, health officials in Coconino County said keeping the park open put employees, residents and tourists at risk.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state program that was created to process unemployment applications for self-employed individuals or gig economy workers appears to have been illegally accessed and has been shut down, officials announced Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he learned Friday evening that an applicant for the program is believed to have somehow accessed the system, prompting an investigation of a possible data breach. The probe will determine if any personal data from applicants was obtained. If any individuals had their data compromised, they will be notified, and steps will be taken to address the situation, including possible credit monitoring, Hutchinson said. An outside IT expert was brought in to review the system. “We want to make sure that the system is in good shape before it goes back online,” the governor said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: With ample coronavirus tests and not enough sick people seeking them, the mayor recently did something on a scale no other major U.S. city had done: allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested as often as they want. A website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation’s second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn’t get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others. But despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn’t show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren’t being used each week, according to figures provided to the Associated Press by the mayor’s office. “Wasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. “I applaud what they’re doing. The more people tested the better.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis says he expects to see many K-12 public schools open this fall in his state and elsewhere despite the coronavirus threat, though “it’s not going to look like any other school year.” Polis told “Fox News Sunday” that Colorado schools will likely run in a “hybrid” fashion that limits social interactions in hallways and during lunchtime and has up to 20% of kids continue with online classes at home if that’s their parents’ preference. The Democratic governor said schools also may close periodically when “there’s an inevitable outbreak.” President Donald Trump has urged K-12 schools to reopen, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told Congress last week that it may be reckless to rush kids back before doctors have a better sense of the dangers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal judge is set to hear arguments this week in a lawsuit that attempts to force the state to take new measures to protect prison inmates from the coronavirus. U.S. District Court Judge Janet Bond Arterton will hold the hearing by video conference next Friday. The ACLU of Connecticut is asking the court to order emergency actions that could include releasing more inmates to protect them from the pandemic. Dan Barrett, the ACLU of Connecticut’s legal director, said the organization is upset that many inmates, including some who are most at-risk for catching the virus, are still being housed in dormitories where social distancing is impossible. On Friday the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers, which houses inmates in both dormitories and cells, was locked down after 105 asymptomatic inmates tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A man is suing Democratic Gov. John Carney in federal court over restrictions he has imposed on access to the state’s beaches and his ban on short-term rentals. Patrick J. Murray argues in a complaint filed Friday that the restrictions imposed by Carney because of the coronavirus deprive him of his liberty and his property in violation of the Constitution. Murray is seeking restraining orders prohibiting Carney from restricting access to beaches in any way other than requiring face coverings and from continuing a blanket ban on short-term rentals and commercial lodging. Murray is being represented in the case by his wife, Georgetown attorney Julianne Murray. He swore in an affidavit that he will suffer irreparable injury if he is unable to rent the couple’s Dewey Beach condominium starting Memorial Day weekend because the rental income from the summer pays the mortgage for the year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro and Metrobus riders will soon be required to wear masks or other face coverings in an effort to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Washington Post reports the requirement begins Monday. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said that bus and train operators had asked for the requirement. Customer surveys found that riders supported the idea as well. Wiedefeld said the mask policy will not be enforced with any criminal sanctions. But he said the agency is trying to determine if it has enough masks to provide to passengers if there are disputes over the policy. He said he hopes riders take responsibility and consider the health of others. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents most of Metro’s workers, tweeted: “This is necessary to keep transit workers and riders safe!”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Guests flocked to a theme park shopping district, a casino fired up its slot machines, and businesses prepared for serving customers Sunday. In Orlando, it was the first weekend since Universal CityWalk reopened Thursday. The Orlando Sentinel reports visitors entered wearing obligatory face masks, having their temperatures taken by workers as stickers marked the 6-foot space required between guests. The spinning Universal Studios globe at the far end of CityWalk was a typical selfie spot as guests flocked to take photos, many removing their masks to flash their smiles. On Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a “full Phase 1” reopening of the economy, which include gyms, starting Monday. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure remain closed along with other central Florida theme parks as state officials and business leaders continue to evaluate before deciding when to reopen.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials reported Friday that the state has surpassed 300,000 coronavirus tests, though that still represents a small fraction of Georgia’s overall population. The state health department had received just under 301,900 test results as of Friday afternoon. Of those, roughly 36,700 were positive for the virus. The state’s death toll from the virus was just over 1,550. Gov. Brian Kemp said the state was “moving the needle on testing” everyday. Georgia went from 200,000 reported tests to 300,000 in a matter of ten days, according to Kemp. But the latest testing figure still represents less than 3% of the state’s population. And an Associated Press analysis found Georgia was among 41 states that are falling short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers plan to set aside more than half of the money the state received in federal coronavirus relief money to bolster the state’s unemployment insurance fund. The House Finance Committee on Friday approved legislation sending $635 million, out of $1.25 billion allocated by the U.S. Congress to Hawaii, to the state’s rainy day fund for this purpose. The bill next goes to the House floor for a vote. Committee Chairwoman Rep. Sylvia Luke said this money is needed because the surge in joblessness during the coronavirus pandemic has severely depleted the unemployment insurance fund. It held $550 million before the pandemic hit, but the state has already distributed $200 million of that as claims have jumped, she said. At the current rate, the money will be depleted by the end of next month.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is holding an entirely mail-in primary for the first time as it works to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Ballots must be requested by Tuesday and returned by 8 p.m. June 2 to local county elections offices, with results announced that evening. The Idaho secretary of state’s office said 320,000 ballots have been requested and mailed out, with about 100,000 returned in what could be a record turnout. “It’s looking like equal or better than the presidential primary” in March, said Secretary of State Chief Deputy Chad Houck. Democratic voters will see one high-profile name on their ballot: Former 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paulette Jordan of Plummer is running against former congressional candidate Jim Vandermaas, a retired law enforcement worker from Eagle, for a chance to challenge GOP Sen. Jim Risch in November.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State officials announced Friday that people working essential jobs can get tested for the coronavirus regardless of whether they show symptoms of COVID-19. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state has been able to conduct at least 11,000 tests daily since April 24. He said that total has nearly doubled in recent days, allowing tests for anyone with symptoms or working an essential job under the statewide stay-at-home order, including first responders and those working in nursing homes, grocery stores, restaurants, correctional facilities and child care centers. Anyone exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient also can get tested, state officials said. “Testing, testing, testing,” Pritzker said. “That’s what every epidemiologist, every immunologist, every responsible business owner and everyone who cares about safely opening up our economy says we must do to successfully maintain a high standard of protection.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Forty-six more residents have died from coronavirus illnesses, putting the state’s pandemic death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 above 1,700, health officials said Saturday. Meanwhile, there was a line of vehicles as long as 3 miles as people drove up to get boxes of meat, fruit and vegetables at the state fairgrounds. “It was worth the wait, honestly. It’s been very helpful for my family,” said Lyneca Sims, 37, who was put out of work when many retailers were required to shut down. “It’s really nice that they’re offering the fresh fruits instead of the canned.” Officials say people with symptoms of COVID-19 or who need a test to return to work after being exposed to the virus can be tested at state-run sites. The state also is encouraging those without symptoms but considered high-risk because of their age or health conditions to get tested.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: University of Iowa researchers warned that the coronavirus would continue spreading through the state even before Gov. Kim Reynolds reopened restaurants and churches, a move they said would exacerbate the problem, documents released Friday show. The researchers, including some of the state’s top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, also warned that hundreds more residents would likely die through the end of May even if widespread business closures remained in effect. Reynolds has downplayed the importance of such models and continued her push to reopen the economy, despite surging numbers of deaths last week. Restaurants, gyms, barbershops and salons reopened Friday in 22 counties, including the state’s largest metropolitan areas, where they had been closed for two months. Reynolds also warned that not reopening the state would have a “social cost,” including high unemployment, rising domestic abuse and food insecurity.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Data on COVID-19 infections that had been trending downward, leading Kansas to begin reopening its economy, is beginning to fluctuate and flatten, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday. “It demonstrates that the disease is still spreading in our communities,” Kelly said one day after slowing the reopening of the state’s economy by ordering bars and bowling alleys to remain closed at least through the end of the month. She said she hoped to stick with the state’s reopening plan as much as possible. “But,” she added, “I have always said that until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, manufactured and widely distributed, our future remains subject to the whims of this virus.” Some of the state’s biggest problems have been in meatpacking facilities, with 1,791 cases and four deaths, and in prisons, with 917 cases and five deaths, said Dr. Lee Norman, the top administrator at the state health department.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State parks will start reopening soon as Kentucky continues to ease restrictions amid the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. The parks will reopen June 1 in an effort to revive tourism revenue, Beshear said at his daily briefing. People can make park reservations starting Tuesday, he said. Visitors will be expected to follow social distancing and health guidelines, he said. Reopening to the public will be state resort parks, recreational parks, lodges and cabins beginning June 1, he said. State resort parks designated to house some coronavirus patients won’t reopen to the public June 1, Beshear said. Those are Lake Cumberland, Lake Barkley, Blue Licks Battlefield and Buckhorn Lake.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: After weeks of shuttered businesses and houses of worship, the city took its first steps Saturday to loosen restrictions in place for two months to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The rest of the state took that step Friday with many businesses and houses of worship allowed to reopen at 25% capacity. New Orleans is slightly more restrictive. Restaurants and certain other businesses such as nail salons are also required to take reservations. The city has also imposed caps designed to keep houses of worship and movie theaters at fewer than 100 people. Casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Kirk Estopinal, one of the owners of Cane & Table in the French Quarter, opened Saturday afternoon after the two-month forced hiatus. To reduce contact as much as possible, guests can order their food when they make a reservation online, they’re asked to wear masks when they come, and the staff will do the same.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Education secured internet access and devices for all of the more than 20,000 students who needed them to continue their learning from home, Gov. Janet Mills and Education Commissioner Pender Makin announced Friday. The effort was launched to help students who didn’t have the tools to participate in online learning after the suspension of classroom-based instruction because of the pandemic. “It is our responsibility to ensure that Maine’s teachers, and all students, have the tools they need to stay connected during these unprecedented times,” Mills said in a statement. It was a combined effort of the Department of Education, Department of Administrative and Financial Services, ConnectME, and business and philanthropic entities. Makin said the pandemic drew attention to “extreme inequities” during the educational disruption. “The emergency provision of connectivity to all students allows for educational continuity,” she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State residents wanting to get married may now apply for marriage licenses by email, regular mail or at a drop-off as courthouses remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The one-page applications, which require couples to provide personal information such as Social Security numbers and any past marriages, are mandatory for couples to have their marriages recognized by the state, The Baltimore Sun reports. That information must be sworn under oath either before the clerk, by video conferencing or by an affidavit included with the application. Applications submitted by email should not include Social Security numbers. Applicants will later have to provide Social Security numbers by phone or video conference. Before the pandemic, couples were required to fill out applications in person.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker is urging companies to let as many employees as possible work from home to help limit the spread of the coronavirus, even after the state begins to restart the economy. About half of executive branch state employees who work under the governor’s office have been working remotely, Baker said Friday during a press conference. He said he’s extending that for the foreseeable future. Companies that call workers back into the office will have to demonstrate they can maintain social distancing in the workplace. “You need to respect the virus,” Baker said. Several large companies including Raytheon, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Takeda and Wayfair have successfully allowed many of their employees to work from home, the Republican governor said. He is set to unveil a plan Monday to reopen some businesses in the state.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Nasal swabs, not wheel alignments, will be performed at a former Sears auto repair shop in the city. Sparrow Health System is opening a drive-thru coronavirus testing site in the vehicle bays. Sears closed earlier this year at Frandor Mall. “This is just a godsend,” Sparrow chief executive James Dover said. Starting Monday, people can drive up and be tested for the coronavirus or tested to see if they were already infected and have antibodies. No one needs to leave a vehicle, and health staff are protected from the weather. Sparrow can also take other routine blood samples. A doctor’s order isn’t necessary but would make the process faster, Dover said. People can provide insurance information or pay immediately. Antibody testing is $50, and the nasal swab is $70. Sparrow’s lab can run between 1,200 and 1,600 tests a day, said lab director Jon Baker.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state took further steps Friday to turn the dial on easing its restrictions meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic and to honor the victims of COVID-19. The state’s infectious disease director, Kris Ehresmann, told reporters in the department’s daily briefing that it’s important with the state’s stay-at-home order expiring Monday and some businesses reopening to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. “We want you to enjoy the weather, we want you to look forward to Monday, but we want you to stay 6 feet apart, wear a cloth mask when you’re outside of your home, and don’t gather in groups any larger than 10,” she said. Gov. Tim Walz ordered that flags at state and federal buildings in Minnesota to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Tuesday and on the 19th of every month through 2020 “to remember, mourn, and honor lives lost due to COVID-19.” He encouraged individuals, businesses and other organizations to join in.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: Federal agents seized more than 280,000 masks from a pharmaceutical company last month under a law prohibiting the hoarding of in-demand equipment needed by health workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recently unsealed search warrant. FBI agents raided Gulf Coast Pharmaceuticals Plus LLC in Ocean Springs on April 17 and confiscated the supply of more than 6,500 N95 respirator masks, as well as thousands of lab coats, face shields, gloves and more, The Sun Herald reports, citing the warrant unsealed in U.S. District Court. The company is owned by developer Kenneth Ritchey. His attorney, Erich Nichols, said that they are working with the government in the investigation and that Ritchey has donated “hundreds, if not thousands, of PPE” to two local health systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City officials are handing out at least 75,000 masks as the region prepares to relax stay-at-home orders. Over two days, city officials say they handed out 42,000 masks to more than 30 senior living facilities, including nursing homes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Each employee and resident of the senior centers will receive five masks, Mayor Lyda Krewson said during a briefing Friday. The city also has distributed 15,000 masks to the city Housing Authority for its residents and 18,000 to the city’s Human Services Department, which is giving them to the people it serves. That includes recipients of its home-delivered meal program for the elderly.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., voted against the $3trillion COVID-19 package passed Friday by the House, saying it was “careless” and a liberal wish-list. The bill, which would cost more than the four previous COVID-19 bills combined, has little chance of becoming law as written but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections. The proposal would bring almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service, the Associated Press reported. “Montana businesses, desperate to reopen, shouldn’t have to compete with expansive unemployment benefits that run through next spring,” Gianforte said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state will require long-term care centers to develop formal plans outlining how they’ll keep the coronavirus from spreading among the vulnerable residents who live in those facilities, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Friday. Facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living centers will have to submit plans to state regulators explaining how they intend to identify ill people and deal with visitors for the rest of the year. They’ll also have to discuss their disinfection protocols. The announcement comes as state officials scramble to keep the virus from spreading among long-term care facilities, whose residents are generally older and have underlying health problems. Long-term care residents are among the hardest-hit population groups in Nebraska, accounting for at least 75 of the state’s 113 coronavirus deaths. At least 82 long-term care facilities have reported coronavirus cases in Nebraska, including 35 with cases among residents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city has announced that downtown restaurants and businesses operating under the first two phases of state reopening orders are allowed to extend operations to the sidewalk during regular business hours. Outdoor dining and sidewalk sales are now permitted. But each business must continue implementing social distancing measures by keeping tables, chairs and other furniture 6 feet from pedestrian paths, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Nonessential businesses stopped operations in March after Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak implemented a stay-at-home order and required essential businesses to follow additional guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The city added its own restrictions, including limits on the size of the public sidewalk frontage, maintaining access to fire hydrants, building entrances and exits, and sanitation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers say they’re returning for legislative sessions in June but meeting outside their respective chambers at the Statehouse – the first time since the Civil War. Instead of meeting at Representatives Hall, the 400-member House will meet at the Whittemore Center at the University of New Hampshire in Durham on June 11. The arena is home to the UNH Wildcats Hockey and is used for other large events. “We need a place that is large enough to allow us to socially distance while not being so large as to create its own logistical problems,” Speaker of the House Stephen Shurtleff said in an announcement Friday. He said each member will have a temperature check prior to entering the arena. Also, per UNH guidelines, each member will be given an N95 respirator mask. Members will have to wear them inside, Shurtleff said. The 24-member Senate will meet in Representatives Hall. Lawmakers are working on a date.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration is citing a 2005 emergency powers law enacted after Hurricane Katrina to block some information about the state’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Under New Jersey’s open records law, the Associated Press sought reports that Murphy required under a March executive order calling for hospitals and nursing homes to disclose their capacity and supplies during the outbreak. The AP also sought records on any commandeered medical supplies authorized under another order. Both requests were denied citing the 2005 Emergency Health Powers Act, which says reports and other records made during an emergency are not considered public. Other news organizations have been denied on the same grounds, including the USA TODAY Network. The state denied the network records showing how the state worked with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as on how it managed protective gear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The loosening of some restrictions imposed on nonessential businesses by the governor two months ago to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak took effect Saturday, along with a new edict that people wear masks in public under most circumstances. The loosening of restrictions applied to most of the state but not in the northwest region, where McKinley and San Juan counties are located along with Cibola County. Under the new guidelines, retailers and many services along with houses of worship could reopen at limited capacity. Also, in a new move to combat the spread, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered that face masks be worn in public, but with exceptions that included eating, drinking and exercising. Wearing masks is needed to help produce “a safe environment,” but police will not ticket people not wearing some sort of face covering, she said Friday.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: People who flouted coronavirus restrictions for a weekend night on the town got the mayor’s wrath Sunday. Mayor Bill de Blasio admonished people seen crowding outside bars, many with drinks in hand but no masks on their faces, for putting lives in danger. Officials may go so far as to shut down establishments that are violating social distancing rules, de Blasio said, asking residents to call 311, the city’s non-emergency hotline, if they see this type of crowding. Bars and restaurants in the city have been restricted to takeout and delivery service since mid-March, when coronavirus cases started to soar, but some in Manhattan were allowing people to dine and drink inside Saturday. Meanwhile, after a rash of violent social distancing arrests involving people of color, the city eased up on social distancing enforcement this week by no longer having police officers break up small groups of people or confront citizens about failing to wear a mask.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A federal judge on Saturday sided with conservative Christian leaders and blocked the enforcement of restrictions that Gov. Roy Cooper ordered affecting indoor religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. The order from Judge James C. Dever III came days after two Baptist churches, a minister and a Christian revival group filed a federal lawsuit seeking to immediately block enforcement of rules covering religious services within the Democratic governor’s executive orders. Dever agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued that the limits violate their rights to worship freely and treat churches differently from retailers and other secular activities. Dever said he does not doubt that Cooper “is acting in good faith” to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but the restrictions applied to one group and not another do little to help the goal and burden religious freedom.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: While a task force of state and local officials wrestles with high COVID-19 numbers in the Fargo area, one shuttered business in the city is set to reopen Monday: a medical marijuana dispensary. The facility in North Dakota’s largest city closed down in early April when its operators cited slow sales and regulatory delays due to the coronavirus. It was the first of eight dispensaries in the state to open after voters approved medical marijuana in November 2016. The dispensary formerly known as The Botanist has new owners and a new name, Pure Dakota Health. Meanwhile, the effort to test targeted areas in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, metropolitan area bumped the coronavirus numbers to new daily highs in Saturday’s report, North Dakota health officials said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recent law school graduates will have the ability to temporarily practice law in the state under the supervision of an experienced attorney while they wait to take the bar exam, the state’s highest court has decided. The Ohio Supreme Court’s announcement Thursday came on the heels of its decision to postpone the bar exam originally scheduled for July until Sept. 9-10, due to risks surrounding the new coronavirus. Recent law graduates can apply to use the supervised practice option beginning June 15. The attorney or attorneys who supervise them must be in good standing and have practiced for at least three years. Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor said in a statement that delaying graduates’ ability to practice law would create significant financial hardship for many. She said providing flexibility also acknowledges the need for lawyers in certain critical areas during the pandemic.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state reopened bars Friday and allowed weddings, funerals and organized sports to resume under the next phase of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s statewide reopening plan. Stitt said last week that data supports moving forward, including a continuing decline in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and a steady decline in the percentage of positive tests since the state started to reopen April 24. “I want Oklahoma to be the first state in the nation to get its wings back and serve as an example,” Stitt said. Phase two of the governor’s reopening plan still calls for employers to close common areas, enforce social distancing, and wear protective equipment such as masks and gloves when interacting with the public. Not all employers were following the state guidelines. At the Capitol on Friday, members of the House and Senate met in large groups, frequently shook hands and violated social distancing guidelines. Most did not wear masks.\n\nOregon\n\nPacific City: Two motel owners in the city are suing Tillamook County, saying coronavirus restrictions that stopped their businesses from fully operating in the past two months violate their constitutional rights. The motels contend the county’s March 22 resolution halting most overnight lodging violates Fifth Amendment protections against the “taking of property without just compensation,” as well as their due process rights, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The county lacked authority to issue the restrictions and adopted them in an “illogical and irrational” manner, the lawsuit says. The resolution called for closing all transient lodging – hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and short-term rentals including condos – “to all visitors who are not providing essential services or are here for commercial reasons such as construction, trucking, etc.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State health officials are being “misinformed” about the availability of personal protective equipment inside hospitals, one of the state’s largest nurses’ unions alleges in a letter that says hospitals have “resorted to severe rationing” even as they resume elective surgeries. The 8,500-member Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals said in a letter to the state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, that working conditions inside hospitals remain unsafe because of lax COVID-19 guidance issued by the Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Pennsylvania health care professionals are scared, exhausted, starting to get sick, and some are dying,” wrote Mark Warshaw, the union’s co-executive director. “The CDC and DOH guidance have given hospitals an excuse and enabled them to ignore basic protections and safety standards for health care workers, and we are the ones suffering.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Friday seeking the release of dozens of detainees at a federal lockup where it says the virus is spreading “uncontrollably.” The number of detainees who have tested positive for the virus has more than doubled in recent days at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls from 15 to 38, the civil rights group’s Rhode Island chapter said. Ten staff members have also tested positive. The lockup can hold as many as 770 inmates, but it’s not clear how many are currently held there. Detainees include those in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ACLU argues in its suit filed in federal court in Providence that it’s not possible for detainees to follow social distancing guidelines because they’re in cells that measure 5 feet by 9 feet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With the reopening of close-contact businesses imminent, the governor urged the state’s residents to patronize local businesses shuttered for weeks during the coronavirus outbreak, albeit with appropriate safety precautions. “Be safe, but go,” Gov. Henry McMaster said Friday. “Our economy is not made to be shut down.” But the governor went on to note, “This virus is still here. It is still highly contagious.” McMaster spoke with reporters during a break in Friday’s meeting of a component of his committee tasked with making recommendations for reopening the state following shutdowns during the outbreak. Monday marks the date on which businesses like hair salons and fitness centers can reopen across South Carolina, where more than 486,000 unemployment claims have been filed in the past two months.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday but no new deaths tied to the coronavirus. Health officials said 3,135 of the state’s 3,987 coronavirus cases have been reported in Minnehaha County, which is South Dakota’s most populous county and the location of a large outbreak at a pork processing plant. Health officials said the number of deaths tied to the coronavirus remained at 44 on Sunday. The number of hospitalized patients was 77 on Sunday, up two from the previous day. A total of 312 cases have required hospitalization. Health officials have warned the the actual number of infections is higher because many people may not display symptoms or have not sought testing for mild symptoms.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Restaurants and retail stores throughout the majority of the state will no longer need to limit capacity starting late this week. In addition, large attractions, including racetracks, amusement parks, waterparks, theaters, museums and auditoriums, will be allowed to reopen starting Friday, provided they practice appropriate social distancing to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes will be allowed in 89 of Tennessee’s 95 counties, with the remainder – Davidson, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, Madison and Sullivan – following their own reopening plans. Gov. Bill Lee, along with the state’s Economic Recovery Group, made the announcement Friday, saying that “Tennesseans have worked incredibly hard to do their part and help slow the spread of COVID-19 so that our state can begin to reopen.” Despite the new guidance for large attractions, Lee said restrictions on social gatherings of 10 or more people will remain in place.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: More than 3,000 nursing home residents in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to data released by the state Friday. The 3,000 positive tests represent about 4% of the estimated number of Texans living in nursing homes, the Houston Chronicle reports. By comparison, about 0.15% of Texas residents have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday ordered coronavirus testing for all Texas nursing home residents and staff after the White House urged governors to do so as deaths mount nationwide. While nursing home residents in Texas make up about 6% of the state’s positive cases, they account for about 38% of the state’s deaths related to COVID-19, the newspaper reports.\n\nUtah\n\nKaysville: A Republican mayor will allow a country music concert protest event later this month, defying newly loosened health rules aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic. Kaysville Mayor Katie Witt acknowledged the May 30 event would violate current state directives but told the Salt Lake Tribune: “I believe I need to support people’s First Amendment rights.” She is also running for Congress, and her opponents questioned whether her approval of the show by well-known singer Nashville-based Collin Raye was politically motivated and could prove risky for public health. The event is sponsored by Utah Business Revival, which has also backed other protests calling on the state to lift restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert relaxed many of those restrictions and allowed businesses to reopen across much of the state Saturday outside of some hot spots.\n\nVermont\n\nMarshfield: Gov. Phil Scott relaxed his order for Vermonters to stay home and announced Friday that lodging and campgrounds may open May 22 if they abide by safety guidelines and cleaning requirements while also limiting the number of people allowed in. At the same time, the Republican governor extended a state of emergency until June 15 to continue to fight the spread – albeit at one of the slowest rates in the country – of the coronavirus pandemic in Vermont. “Because of the success we’ve had, we’re now asking Vermonters to be smart and stay safe,” he said at a news briefing, adding that “staying close to home and limiting the number of people you’re in contact with is still really important.” People over age 65 or with chronic conditions should still remain at home as much as possible, he said. The order encourages face masks in public but doesn’t require them, Scott said. Municipalities may implement stricter requirements, he said. Vermont has the lowest average three-day growth rate of coronavirus cases in the country, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Warm weather drew crowds to the Virginia Beach oceanfront even though the beach is considered closed under the state’s stay-at-home directives. Families ordered snow cones, bought hermit crabs and cramped gift shops while bikers pedaled on the boardwalk Saturday, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Tents, umbrellas and beach blankets were set up near the water. Under Gov. Ralph Northam’s first phase of a gradual reopening plan, retail stores are reopening with limited capacity, but indoor gyms remain closed, beaches are still off-limits, and restaurants cannot provide indoor dine-in service. The newspaper reports the beach was not jammed, and groups maintained their distance. Many people on the boardwalk wore masks. Kayla Thomas, serving scones at an oceanfront concession stand, said the crowds looked like those she might see at the beginning of summer. “I’m just shocked by the amount of people,” Thomas said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two people in the state who recall being sick in December have since had blood tests showing they developed antibodies for the coronavirus, but health officials aren’t counting them in their official case counts. The positive serology tests can’t determine whether the people had the coronavirus in December, weeks before the disease was officially detected in the United States. They may have been exposed after the first recorded case. One of the people had lunch with a hospital nurse in Kirkland, for example, site of a large outbreak in a nursing home. “They are being considered ‘probable,’ ” Heather Thomas, a Snohomish Health District spokeswoman, told The Seattle Times. If any Washington cases predated the first known case, there were probably very few that didn’t multiply, Dr. Jared Roach, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Systems Biology, a Seattle-based biomedical research firm, told the newspaper.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice stressed Friday that medical experts are leading his plan to lift coronavirus restrictions, days after he widened his strategy at the request of business owners. The Republican governor has expanded the most aggressive stage of his reopening plan to allow the reopening of gyms and tanning salons next week after he said the businesses bombarded his office with calls. Still, he said it’s “way out in left field” to suggest he is making decisions based on political pressure. “That noise or that pressure is not going to influence a decision in any way, no possibility,” he said. The governor has timed several reopenings around Memorial Day weekend. Gyms can open Monday. On Thursday, tanning salons, restaurants at half-capacity, big box stores and all-terrain vehicle rental businesses can reopen. Campgrounds can open for in-state residents Thursday, as can the Hatfield-McCoy trails, whitewater rafting and zipline businesses. The Greenbrier, a private resort Justice owns, is also set to reopen Friday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Local health officials across the state began rescinding their stay-at-home orders Friday after attorneys warned the mandates could be vulnerable to legal challenges after the state Supreme Court wiped out Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide order. The Wisconsin Counties Association posted a message on its website after the court ruled Wednesday saying it’s unclear whether local orders mimicking the statewide mandate would stand up in court. Health officials in Kenosha County withdrew their stay-at-home order Thursday night in light of the WCA warning. Brown and Manitowoc counties as well as the cities of Cudahy and Appleton dropped their orders Friday afternoon. The ruling led bars, restaurants, hair salons and other businesses to open immediately or begin making plans to reopen. Fearing infections might spike as people begin moving around again, about a dozen counties issued their own stay-at-home orders.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A ski hill that shut down in March due to the coronavirus pandemic plans to reopen starting Memorial Day weekend. Snow King Mountain has developed an operations plan and will open for summer season as scheduled May 23, officials at the ski hill in Jackson announced Thursday. The announcement came as Wyoming prepared to ease up on public health measures. Starting Friday, people could gather in groups as large as 25, up from 10 previously, and dine in at restaurants where servers wear masks and keep tables widely separated. Summer offerings at Snow King will include a scenic lift, mini golf, ropes course and zip lines. The Kings Grill restaurant will open for prepackaged snacks and drinks. Bikes, stand-up paddle boards and kid kayaks will be available for rent, and guided hikes will be available for small groups. Employees in close contact with guests will wear masks and enforce social-distancing guidelines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/10/donald-trump-and-john-bolton-clashed-over-iran-north-korea-venezuela/2275278001/", "title": "Why the Trump-Bolton breakup was inevitable. They clashed over ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The political marriage between President Donald Trump and his hawkish national security adviser John Bolton was troubled from the start.\n\nTrump campaigned on withdrawing the U.S. from “endless wars,” while Bolton embraced an aggressive, interventionist foreign policy agenda.\n\nTrump sought negotiations with reviled despots. Bolton wanted the U.S. to topple them.\n\nTheir opposing views collided most recently over Afghanistan, spilling into public view over the weekend. Trump disclosed on Saturday that he had invited, and then uninvited, the Taliban – a militant Islamic group – to Camp David to seal a peace deal that would have paved the way for a U.S. withdrawal from that 18-year war. Bolton argued that the Taliban could not be trusted.\n\nWhether that rift was the last straw for Trump, or for Bolton, is not clear. That was just one of oh-so-many matters on which they disagreed.\n\nMore:Donald Trump fires national security adviser John Bolton, citing 'disagreements'\n\n\"You can only say 'no, no, no' to a president so many times,\" said Aaron David Miller, who served as a top State Department negotiator for past presidents of both parties and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and - the last straw - Afghanistan ... They were out of sync both personally and on policy.”\n\nTake North Korea, for starters. Trump relished showy summits with Kim Jong Un, the country’s ruthless leader. Bolton was skeptical that such talks would amount to anything.\n\nMore:'Bolton contradicts Trump on whether he was fired\n\nThat was on display during the last Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, where North Korean officials offered to partially dismantle their country’s primary nuclear facility. Bolton, among others, successfully pressed Trump to reject the deal and demand full denuclearlization. The talks collapsed and both leaders went home empty-handed.\n\nIn the months since those negotiations stalled, North Korea has repeatedly tested short-range missiles – a provocation that Bolton has highlighted and Trump has downplayed.\n\nMore:North Korea says it's ready to restart talks with the U.S., but then fires more weapons\n\nTrump’s approach is to “stiff arm” his counterpart with one hand and offer an olive branch with the other, said James Carafano, a national security and foreign policy expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Bolton’s approach, he said, is to negotiate only an opponent’s surrender.\n\nCarafano argued that despite those tactical differences, Trump and Bolton agreed on a broad swath of issues. They both strongly supported Brexit, the United Kingdom’s efforts to leave the European Union. They shared a distaste for the United Nations and agreed on the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, a landmark U.S.-Russia arms control treaty and other several other multilateral pacts.\n\nMore:Here’s what you missed about Brexit in the U.K. last week\n\nBut Bolton wanted to aggressively confront Iran, particularly after its military shot down a U.S. drone this summer. He sought military options for ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He opposed Trump’s plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nMore:Iran reduces nuclear deal compliance, warns 'not much time left' to save accord\n\nTrump viewed Bolton as a warmonger, and some of the president's allies feared the hard-line national security adviser was pulling him deeper into military conflicts, particularly in the Middle East.\n\nMore:What a multi-million dollar 'bribe' for oil supertanker says about Trump’s Iran policy\n\n\"It seems clear that Bolton and Trump did not share anything close to a similar view of global affairs,\" said Harry J. Kazianis, senior director of the Center for the National Interest, which advocates for \"strategic realism\" in U.S. foreign policy. \"Trump is now free to find a national security adviser who is against wars of regime change, a smaller footprint in the Middle East, some sort of diplomatic track with North Korea and a much bigger focus on the rise of China.\"\n\nForeign policy expert Danielle Pletka said Iran may have been the most contentious foreign policy clash between Bolton and Trump.\n\nMore:Why Donald Trump's plan to host Taliban at prestigious Camp David stirred bipartisan outrage\n\nTrump has embraced a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at isolating Iran economically and politically. But at the same time, the president has repeatedly said he would meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with no preconditions.\n\nSuch a session would likely make Bolton’s blood boil, said Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where Bolton served as a senior fellow before joining the Trump administration.\n\n“He doesn’t believe in the power of talk, except on truly rare occasions,” Pletka said. “He’s very, very hawkish.”\n\nIt’s perhaps fitting that Trump and Bolton even clashed on Tuesday as their inevitable divorce became official. Trump said in a tweet that he had fired Bolton because of their policy clashes.\n\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" the president wrote on Tuesday. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration.\"\n\nBolton quickly responded with his own tweet: \"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow.'\"\n\nContributing: Michael Collins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/felixvailgone/2016/12/29/felix-vail-gone-one-wife-dead-two-other-missing-jerry-mitchell/95895894/", "title": "GONE", "text": "Jerry Mitchell\n\nDecember 30, 2016\n\nMy office telephone rang, and a woman asked, “Would you be interested in writing about a serial killer living in Mississippi?”\n\n“Yes, I would,” I replied.\n\nThe woman’s name was Mary Rose. She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/03/balloon-fiesta-yard-shark-street-stunts-news-around-states/50798083/", "title": "Injured musher, yard shark: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state appeals court has upheld the felony convictions of a man who served 38 years as sheriff in a northern Alabama county. In the unanimous ruling Friday, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals also denied former Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely’s request for a new trial, AL.com reports. “This evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that Blakely acted with intent to use his public office to obtain personal gain,” Presiding Judge Mary B. Windom wrote. Blakely was removed from office in August 2021 after a jury convicted him of theft and abuse of power. Prosecutors said the theft charge was tied to accusations that he deposited $4,000 of campaign funds into his personal account. The abuse of power charge was tied to Blakely borrowing money from a jail safe that held inmates’ money. Prosecutors said Blakely received $29,050 in interest-free loans from the safe. Blakely’s attorneys argued that no inmate was ever deprived of money. The trial judge gave him a three-year sentence. Blakely remains out on bond and can ask the Alabama Supreme Court to review the case. Blakely’s attorneys argued to the appeals court that the state failed to show sufficient evidence that he intentionally used his office for personal gain.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A reality television star and Iditarod musher was injured last week while helping to clean up storm damage along the state’s western coast. Jessie Holmes, who since 2015 has starred in “Life Below Zero,” a show about life in rural Alaska produced by National Geographic TV, was injured by falling debris in a building in the community of Golovin on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. He was flown for treatment to Nome and then sent to an Anchorage hospital, where officials said he was treated and released. “I wanted to take a moment to let everyone know how much I appreciate all the love, support, and prayers,” Holmes wrote in a post on his kennel’s Facebook page Thursday. Parts of Alaska’s Bering Sea coast were left with severe damage beginning Sept. 16 when the remnants of Typhoon Merbok traveled north through the Bering Strait. Holmes had reached out to defending Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion Brent Sass and two other mushers, Jeff Deeter and Richie Beattie, to travel to hard-hit Golovin to volunteer in the cleanup effort, Sass told the Anchorage newspaper. On Wednesday, they were pulling waterlogged plywood and insulation to help them dry out, Sass said. They were standing underneath the plywood when Holmes pulled down a board, and the entire area collapsed on top of them. Holmes, who finished third in this year’s Iditarod, was trapped underneath the pile of plywood, insulation and other building materials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: All Arizona parents now can use state tax money to send their children to private or religious schools or pay home-schooling costs after an effort by public school advocates to block a massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher law failed to collect enough signatures to block it. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs announced Friday that her office’s review of signatures turned in a week ago to refer the expansion to the ballot came up short of the nearly 119,000 that were needed. Hobbs is a Democrat running for governor who opposed the plan. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey championed the plan and signed it into law in July. He celebrated on Twitter, saying “Let’s Roll!” and “Parents Prevail.” Arizona now has the nation’s most expansive private school voucher law. It allows parents of the state’s more than 1.2 million school-age children to get 90% of the state money that would normally go to their local public schools and use it for private or other school costs. That’s typically about $7,000 per student. The effort to block the expansion passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature over Democratic opposition was organized by Save Our Schools Arizona, a grassroots group of teachers, parents and public education advocates who blocked a similar expansion in 2017. Voters then overwhelmingly rejected the law in the 2018 election.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Voters will decide next month whether recreational marijuana will be legal in the state. Issue 4, to legalize cannabis for residents 21 and older, will be on the Nov. 8 ballots. And the votes will count, the state’s high court has ruled. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the petition submitted by Responsible Growth Arkansas is sufficient. “Accordingly, we grant the petition and order the Secretary of State to certify the proposed amendment for inclusion on the Nov. 8 general election ballot,” the court said in its opinion. Steve Lancaster, an attorney for Responsible Growth Arkansas, the group that gathered the petition signatures, said he learned of the ruling late Thursday afternoon. “It was a surprise to all of us,” Lancaster said. About 193,000 signature were submitted – over 100,000 signatures more than required to make the ballot. “We were well above what we needed,” Lancaster said. “The result is what we expected from the very beginning. We put a lot of work into a good ballot title, and the court agreed this is good to go to let the voters in Arkansas make their own decision on this. And we’re very grateful to the court for giving the people the right to make this decision.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that oil refineries could start selling more polluting winter-blend gasoline ahead of schedule to ease soaring fuel prices, directly contradicting his own goals for reducing climate emissions. The average cost of a gallon of gas was $6.30 in California on Friday, far above the national average of $3.80, according to AAA. Newsom administration officials said the difference between state prices and the national average has never been larger. The Democratic governor also called on state lawmakers to pass a new tax on oil company profits and return the money to California taxpayers. Lawmakers don’t return to the Capitol until January, and Newsom’s office provided few details on the proposal. “They’re ripping you off,” he said of the oil industry in a video posted to Twitter. Oil industry representatives said it is state regulations that cause higher prices in California than the rest of the country. The summer blend of gasoline that refineries are required by law to produce in the hotter months costs more money to make but is designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and smog during summer months. Most refineries can’t switch to the winter blend until November.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: When people who had been homeless for years moved off the city’s streets and into apartments, they were far less likely to end up in hospital emergency rooms or get locked up in jail. But they still died at the same rate as those who lived outside, the Colorado Sun reports. That’s the grim finding from a new study of Denver’s social impact bond program, which sends outreach workers to find the highest users of taxpayer-funded services including hospitals, detox centers and the jail. Hundreds of people who were chronically homeless have been housed through the program, which began seven years ago. Previous research showed that the first 250 participants had cost the government a total of $7.3 million per year when they lived outside and in shelters and cycled through the health care and criminal justice systems. After they were housed, researchers found a 40% reduction in arrests, a 30% reduction in jail stays, a 65% decrease in detox services and a 40% drop in emergency department visits. The reductions made up for half of the cost of the program, which was started with $8.6 million from eight private investors as well as local housing resources. The researchers, from the Urban Institute based in Washington, D.C., noticed high levels of mortality among those who were living in supportive housing. A second study confirmed the death rate among those in apartments was the same as those living outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this year, gun rights groups and firearms owners have launched another attempt to overturn the state’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles that was enacted in response to the Sandy Hook School shooting. A new lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court by three gun owners, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League and the Second Amendment Foundation seeking to overturn the state prohibition on what they call “modern sporting arms” such as AR-15-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 first graders and six educators at the Newtown school in 2012. “We all deserve to live in safe communities, but denying ownership of the most commonly owned firearms in the country is not the way to achieve it,” Holly Sullivan, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said in a statement. “The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision … has opened the door to this challenge, and we believe Connecticut will be hard pressed to prove its statutes are constitutional.” State officials vowed to defend the 2013 gun laws. “Connecticut’s gun laws save lives, and we are not going back,” state Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “We will not allow weapons of war back into our schools, our houses of worship, our grocery stores, and our communities.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Perfect attendance isn’t just for bragging rights anymore – for one University of Delaware student, it’s going to mean money, too. This year the University of Delaware athletics department has unveiled the Cockpit HENergy Challenge, a high-stakes contest to incentivize football game attendance. At the end of the season, one UD student who attended all six home football games will be randomly chosen to win $10,000 in financial aid. “Student engagement is really important to us, and it’s important to the program, in terms of the support and stance and making that atmosphere on game day feel really positive, not just for the team but for the students as well,” said Nick LaMarca, who oversees marketing and engagement for the UD athletics department. LaMarca said the department chose to give out financial aid as the prize after “thinking about what’s important to the students.” He said the money comes from the athletics department specifically, not the university overall. To win the competition, UD students must scan their student football tickets before halftime at every home game. Students who participate in the games – including players, marching band members and people in the UD spirit program – are not eligible.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two bills introduced in Congress on Thursday aim to begin the process of creating a national museum for American LGBTQ+ history and culture in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, introduced the pair of bills ahead of the nation preparing to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month in October. “As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Pocan said. The bills would establish an eight-member commission to study the potential creation of the national museum and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. The bills would be required to be signed into law to become the newest Smithsonian. Pocan said it is vital to remember the nation’s collective past, especially as certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that are harmful to LGBTQ+ youth and the community as a whole. During the process, the developed commission would look into the success of the potential Smithsonian museum by creating a plan of action for the establishment, proposing a fundraising path, identifying potential locations within the District to house the facility and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on southwest Florida isn’t just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbor’s flooded yard. “I didn’t know what it was – it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’ ” He guessed the fish was about 4 feet long. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish, likely a swordfish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark,” while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Friday found that Georgia election practices challenged by a group associated with Democrat Stacey Abrams do not violate the constitutional rights of voters, ruling in favor of the state on all remaining issues in a lawsuit filed nearly four years ago. “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the VRA,” U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta wrote, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He detailed his reasoning in a 288-page order. The lawsuit was filed in November 2018, just weeks after Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican Brian Kemp. Throughout that contest, Abrams had accused Kemp, then secretary of state, of using his position as the state’s top elections official to promote voter suppression. Kemp vehemently denied the allegations. Kemp on Friday applauded the ruling, calling it a loss for Abrams. “Judge Jones’ ruling exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals,” Kemp said in a statement. Abrams and Fair Fight expressed disappointment in the decision but said the lawsuit helped bring about positive change in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the state last week amid lingering community frustration and distrust after jet fuel from a military storage facility last year spilled into Pearl Harbor’s drinking water, poisoned thousands of military families and threatened the purity of Honolulu’s water supply. Austin traveled to the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor on Friday and met the commander of the joint task force in charge of draining its tanks so it can be shut down. He also met with several families affected by the fuel spill and Hawaii state officials, the military said in a news release. The meetings were closed to the media, and Austin didn’t hold a news conference afterward. Outside Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, several dozen protesters held signs saying “Navy Lies” and “Shut Down Red Hill.” People driving by – including many exiting the base – honked in support. Samantha McCoy, whose husband is in the Air Force, said her family suffered migraines, rashes, skin sores and gastrointestinal problems that only subsided when they moved out of military housing last month. She called on Austin to make more medical care available to families. “It took four months of daily migraines to even get a referral to a neurologist. And that’s really unacceptable,” she said at the protest.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: A box truck equipped with a bright LED billboard began circling around the University of Idaho campus Friday. “Pregnant? You still have a choice,” said one of the bright blue-and-white messages flashing across the side. “You can still get abortion pills by mail,” read another message. The moving billboard was a salvo by Mayday Health against Idaho’s anti-abortion laws, including some that prohibit state employees from promoting or endorsing abortion or emergency contraception. The organization seeks to inform people in anti-abortion states how to access abortion and contraception. Mayday Health chose Moscow for the action after the university warned employees not to refer students to abortion or birth control providers lest they run afoul of the state laws. “This effort is part of protecting free speech and the First Amendment,” said Kaori Sueyoshi, Mayday Health ‘s head of strategy. “We want to make sure that students at the University of Idaho and surrounding area have accurate information about how to get birth control pills, Plan B (emergency contraception) as well as how to get safe abortion access.” University of Idaho Provost Torrey Lawrence said the legal guidance simply was intended to protect staffers. Boise State University recently issued similar, albeit less strict, advice.\n\nIllinois\n\nZion: Millions of Ahmadi Muslims around the world believe holy miracle happened in Zion 115 years ago. The Ahmadis view this small city, 40 miles north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan, as a place of special religious significance for their global messianic faith. Their reverence for the community began more than a century ago – with fighting words, a prayer duel and a prophecy. Zion was founded in 1900 as a Christian theocracy by John Alexander Dowie, an evangelical and early Pentecostal preacher who drew thousands to the city with his faith healing ministry. The Ahmadis believe their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, defended the faith from Dowie’s verbal attacks against Islam and defeated him in a sensational faceoff armed only with prayers. Most current residents may not have an inkling of that high-stakes holy fight of a bygone era. But for the Ahmadis, it is one that has created an eternal bond with the city of Zion. Over the weekend, thousands of Ahmadi Muslims from around the world congregated in the city to celebrate that century-old miracle and a significant milestone in the life of Zion and of their faith: the building of the city’s first mosque.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All tax rebate payments from the state’s budget surplus have been printed and mailed, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz said. “We successfully completed printing on September 21 and sent the last batch of automatic taxpayer refund checks to the postal service on September 22,” Klutz said in a statement Thursday. “Most Hoosiers who filed a 2020 tax return in 2021 should have received their automatic taxpayer refund via direct deposit or mailed check by now.” More than 1.5 million checks with the $125 refund were mailed, Klutz’s office said. Eligible Hoosiers will also receive additional payments for $200 for individuals or $400 for couples filing jointly. The Indiana Department of Revenue noted that the eligibility requirements for the two refunds are different. Although all who were eligible for the initial $125 payment qualify for the subsequent $200 refund, some who were not eligible for the first do qualify for the second. Direct deposit payments for the first round of rebates were sent starting in May.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly two years after a federal policy required the nation’s hospitals to unveil the hidden costs of medical care, a tiny fraction of Iowa facilities are in compliance, according to a new report. And patients are paying the price. Only six of the state’s 61 hospitals in Iowa reviewed by researchers – 10% – have complied with the federal rule intended to bring more transparency to health care costs, according to the audit by PatientRightsAdvocate.org published in August. Iowa’s compliance rate is even worse than the national rate. The audit of 2,000 hospitals nationwide found that 319 hospitals, or 16%, complied with the rule. Noncompliant hospitals ranged from small, independent hospitals to some of the largest health care systems in the country, according to PatientRightsAdvocate.org. Iowa health care officials contend their noncompliance is not for lack of trying. Hospitals face significant barriers to publishing the massive amounts of data required under the federal rule, they say. “If you don’t have the knowledge, tools, resources or financial availability to get it done, I’m sure hospitals are not compliant for those reasons,” said Heather Vandewater, business office and patient access director for Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Three months after the National Park Service announced James Williams as the new superintendent of Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Park, the site opened its doors Friday in celebration of the 30th anniversary of its designation. The symposium at the Brown v. Board of Education site also welcomed leaders from five new affiliated areas and an additional National Park Service site. “It’s just interesting to me to get to know the people, get to know their stories, and see the potential for us as an agency to help the American people understand the complexity of the Brown decision and all the history that went into it,” Williams said. Last week’s symposium is historic because it brought together – for the first time – people from each of the sites that are part of Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, said Sean Dixon, president of Visit Topeka. He noted that President Joe Biden last May signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act. That act continues federal government efforts to recognize the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which banned racial segregation in schools in 1954.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An advisory committee set up this year by Gov. Andy Beshear reported that many Kentucky adults favor legalizing medical marijuana, Beshear’s office said Friday. The Democratic governor formed the Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee after a bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate this year. The committee found that Kentuckians who suffer from chronic conditions are not getting relief from painkillers and opioids and fear their addictive properties, Beshear said. The committee also reported that residents are crossing state lines to obtain medical cannabis where it is legal and want to return to Kentucky without breaking the law. The panel found that military veterans from Kentucky reported that cannabis use eased post-traumatic stress disorder, Beshear’s office said in a news release. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey, the committee co-chair, said the panel did not hear any opposition at town hall meetings on the topic. “Everyone who spoke supported legalizing medical cannabis in Kentucky,” Harvey said. “We heard from many Kentuckians that use cannabis for its beneficial medical effects but can only do so by breaking the law as it now exists.” Beshear said he is considering the information while he decides what steps to take next to legalize medical marijuana, which he supports.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Rule No. 1 for this week’s animal blessing at a Catholic university: “Please leave venomous animals at home.” Rule No. 2: Be prepared to clean up after your pet. “We will provide a pet station with complimentary water and waste bags,” said a news release Thursday. The group blessing of the animals – all comers welcome – will be the first since 1999 at Loyola University New Orleans. The Rev. Justin Daffron, Loyola’s interim president, and Parleaux, a black cockapoo he trained as the university’s therapy dog, will attend, university spokeswoman Patricia Murret said Thursday. The service is scheduled for Tuesday evening on the lawn next to the university’s church. Oct. 4 is the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals, ecology, merchants and Italy. Churches and schools from the East Coast to the West Coast hold Blessing of the Animals services. Murret said they were popular at Loyola during the 1990s but apparently fell by the wayside for the next two decades. She doesn’t know why. She said someone suggested resuming the tradition at a late August or early September meeting “about alumni events, bringing people together, reconnecting in this post-pandemic world as we return to life and joy and connections with each other.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state housing authority has halted new applications for emergency rental assistance while it waits to find out if a request for more federal money will be approved. MaineHousing said in a statement that an “unanticipated uptick in demand” and uncertainty about new revenue prompted the decision to pause applications. The program started in March 2021 and stopped taking applications at the end of the day Thursday. The housing authority described the program as a temporary support that is funded via federal money through COVID-19 relief laws. The authority said the pause will allow more than 11,000 pending requests to be processed. The program has helped more than 33,000 households and spent more than $275 million, MaineHousing officials said. The program is mostly used to pay rent directly to landlords. MaineHousing spokesperson Scott Thistle said the pause in applications “a fiscally responsible and reasonable move that will allow us to ensure all who have already applied to this program get a fair opportunity to receive help.” Dozens of other states have paused or ended similar programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Aging infrastructure contributed to an E. coli contamination of the city of Baltimore’s water system in early September, officials said last week. A confluence of events in several parts of the water system reduced chlorine levels, which led to three positive tests for E. coli, a Department of Public Works official told The Washington Post. City officials also detailed their findings during a City Council hearing Thursday. The contamination led to a boil-water advisory for a wide swath of the city and into Baltimore County, which is served by the city system, The Baltimore Sun reports. No illnesses were linked to the contaminated water, a city spokeswoman said Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A former tenant charged with setting a fire at an apartment building that claimed the lives of four people pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Friday and was held without bail. Yvonne Ngoiri, 36, faces four counts of second-degree murder as well as arson and assault charges in connection with the May 14 blaze in Worcester. Among the victims was a man who in 2018 had sued right-wing radio host Alex Jones’ Infowars website. Ngoiri, who once lived in the building, was taken into custody Thursday, the office of Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement. The cause of the early-morning fire at the three-story, six-unit building was determined to be “incendiary,” according to the district attorney’s office, but no motive was disclosed in court. Ngoiri is scheduled back in court Nov. 29. The victims have previously been identified as Joseph Garchali, 47; Christopher Lozeau, 53; Vincent Page, 41; and Marcel Fontaine, 29. In addition, several residents were injured, including one who jumped from a third-story window and two who suffered from smoke inhalation. The building had about 20 tenants. Two nearby buildings were also damaged. Fontaine sued Infowars in 2018, saying it posted his photograph on its website the day of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, depicting him as the gunman.\n\nMichigan\n\nOdessa Township: A homeowner has been charged with shooting and wounding an 84-year-old woman who was canvassing door-to-door against a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion in the state. Richard Harvey was charged Friday on charges of felonious assault and reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury charges, Ionia County Prosecutor Kyle Butler said in a statement. Harvey surrendered to authorities Friday morning and was being held in the county jail. The State Police investigated the Sept. 20 shooting at Harvey’s home in Odessa Township and submitted charging recommendations to the prosecutor’s office, Butler said. The canvasser, Joan Jacobson, told investigators she was asking a woman at the home to vote against Proposal 3 in November when she was told to leave. Jacobson told The Detroit News that she was headed to her car when she “heard a shot” and “felt some pain.” Jacobson said she then drove to a local police station and was later treated at a hospital. Harvey, 74, told WOOD-TV he shot Jacobson accidentally while she was arguing with his wife, and he told Jacobson numerous times to leave their property. Harvey said he fired a warning shot at a tree, and the woman continued “ranting and raving” and waving a clipboard.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mayor Jacob Frey said Thursday that he is nominating a former public safety director from New Jersey as his top pick for the city’s next police chief, at a time when the department is struggling with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. If confirmed by the City Council, Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, would be taking over a department that some city leaders and community members had sought to abolish in recent years, and he would lead the agency through court-ordered changes that are expected as the result of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into policing practices. “What we heard loud and clear is that people wanted a changemaker,” Frey said. “They wanted a reform-minded candidate that would both be accountable to the city of Minneapolis and our residents and also able to drive down crime in a serious way. … Minneapolis has been asking for change, and Brian O’Hara, the deputy mayor, is answering that call.” O’Hara said Thursday that he will work toward driving down gun violence, building up ranks in the police department, and working with the community “to heal the heart of this great city,” and he plans to build a department so good that people of all races and backgrounds will want to be part of it.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The University of Mississippi is paying tribute to 89-year-old James Meredith 60 years after white protesters erupted into violence as he became the first Black student to enroll in what was then a bastion of Deep South segregation. Meredith was honored Saturday during the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, receiving a framed Ole Miss jersey with the number 62 – for 1962, the year he integrated the university. The ceremony happened two days after he attended the Rebels’ practice to speak to players. “He came and revolutionized our thinking. He came to open our closed society,” Donald Cole, who retired in 2018 as the university’s assistant provost and head of multicultural affairs, said during a celebration Wednesday night. The enigmatic Meredith, who lives in Jackson, has long resisted the label of “civil rights leader,” as if civil rights are separate from other human rights. He has said his effort to enter Ole Miss was his own battle to conquer white supremacy. Meredith’s being honored at the Ole Miss-Kentucky game was an ironic echo of history. Two days before he enrolled on the Oxford campus in 1962, race-baiting Gov. Ross Barnett worked a white crowd into a frenzy at a football stadium in Jackson. Ole Miss fans waved Confederate flags to support their Rebels over the Kentucky Wildcats and to defy any move toward racial integration.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to an income tax cut that Gov. Mike Parson requested and ditched a last-minute proposal to cut corporate taxes. The Republican-led Missouri House voted 98-32 in favor of the bill, which would cut income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year and phase in additional cuts until the rate hits 4.5%. The bill applies to the top income tax rate, which covers those who make more than about $8,700 a year in taxable income. The additional cuts would be triggered by revenue growth benchmarks tied to inflation. The roughly $1 billion measure also eliminates the lowest tax bracket, meaning earners who bring in less than about $1,000 a year no longer will have to pay state income taxes. The measure now heads to Parson, who is expected to sign it. The Republican governor called lawmakers back to work to spend some of the state’s record revenue surplus on tax cuts. “We are thrilled that the General Assembly has answered our call to cut Missourians’ taxes and return some of their hard-earned dollars,” he said in a statement. If Parson signs the bill into law, taxpayers who make between $22,000 and $66,000 a year would on average see savings of $10 to $50 next year because of the income tax cut, according to an analysis by the Missouri Budget Project.\n\nMontana\n\nBridger: An evacuation warning was put in place for residents near the town after a train derailed, and two fuel cars ruptured and leaked an estimated 31,000 gallons of gasoline, authorities said Saturday. BNSF Railway Co. said there were no injuries, and crews were working with local officials and hazardous-materials responders to safely clear the site. The derailment of the southbound train occurred on a curving portion of the track about half a mile east of the small south-central Montana town of Bridger, population of about 660, about 45 miles southwest of Billings. “Two of the derailed cars were compromised and leaked gasoline,” BNSF spokesman Ben Wilemon said in an email to the Associated Press. “The cause of the derailment is under investigation.” A 30,000-gallon tank emptied completely, and a second damaged tank leaked about 1,000 gallons before BNSF workers repaired the tank, The Billings Gazette reports. There was no immediate information on whether the spill contaminated groundwater or the area’s irrigation systems. Authorities said about 15 cars derailed not long after midnight. Four of the derailed cars contained petroleum. Officials said the train was also moving coal, sorghum and particle board. The tracks in that area in some portions run near the meandering Clark’s Fork of the Yellowstone River.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A passenger’s cellphone automatically alerted responders after a car hit a tree early Sunday in a crash that killed all six of its young occupants, authorities said. Five men in the car died at the scene of the crash about 2:15 a.m. in Lincoln, about 3 miles east of the state Capitol, police said. A 24-year-old woman died later at a hospital where she was taken in critical condition. The five men who died included the 22-year-old driver. The other victims were one 21-year-old, one 23-year-old and two 22-year-olds. Police did not release any details on what caused the crash but said it was reported by an iPhone that detected the impact and called responders automatically when the phone’s owner didn’t respond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thousands of people in hundreds of cars took over northern Nevada parking lots and intersections Friday night and into Saturday, performing stunts in souped-up vehicles and leading to crashes and arrests, police said. Police beefed up nighttime staffing after social media posts urged people from San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to come to the “sideshow” in Reno, Police Lt. Michael Browett said. The disturbances started late Friday as several hundred cars and their occupants met in the parking lot of a still-open Walmart store. Police tried to break up the crowds, and drivers sped off, meeting up again at several intersections and industrial parks into Saturday morning. A dozen people were arrested, 14 cars impounded and 33 people issued citations. Browett said Reno is just the latest city to see late-night takeovers by auto enthusiasts who ignore law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal and dangerous activity. “I don’t know what the underlying movement is with this group, but it goes a little beyond cars,” Browett said. “They’re very anti-authoritarian, and they basically just show up and do whatever they want.” In Reno, no one was seriously injured. But Browett said those arrested face charges including reckless driving, hit and run causing injury and weapons possession.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Investigators are trying to determine the cause of a fire that heavily damaged a strip mall, the fire department said in a Saturday news release. The fire in the building on Amherst Street that contained a number of businesses was reported about 7:30 p.m. Friday. People who were inside a pizza shop and an Asian market left the building before firefighters arrived. The fire was brought under control in about an hour. There were no injuries. The Nashua Fire Department says the structure was left unusable by the fire. The City of Nashua Fire Marshal’s office is trying to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Democrat-led state Senate on Thursday confirmed Gov. Phil Murphy’s former chief counsel to be New Jersey’s attorney general. Attorney General Matt Platkin had been serving as the state’s acting top law enforcement official since earlier this year when Murphy nominated him. “I pledge to continue to work tirelessly to end the scourge of gun violence, to strengthen trust between law enforcement and the broader public, and to protect the rights of our residents,” he said. Platkin, 35, served as the Murphy administration’s top attorney overseeing pending bills and executive orders for the Democratic governor from the start of the administration in early 2018 until late 2020. He left to take a post at the firm Lowenstein Sandler where he handled white-collar cases and business disputes. Platkin was a fixture during Murphy’s regular news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly fielded questions related to executive orders aimed at curbing the effects of the virus. He was also a lead negotiator for the governor for three annual budget bills and oversaw the vast appointment and nominations apparatus in the governor’s office. New Jersey’s governor is among the most powerful in the country because the state constitution provides for the executive to appoint many offices in the state.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons lifted off Saturday morning, marking the start of an annual fiesta that has drawn pilots and spectators from across the globe to the high desert for 50 years. As one of the most photographed events in the world, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has become an economic driver for the state’s largest city and a rare – and colorful – opportunity for enthusiasts to be within arm’s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated. Three of the original pilots who participated in the first fiesta in 1972 and the family members of others are among this year’s attendees. That first year, 13 balloons launched from an open lot near a shopping center on what was then the edge of Albuquerque. It has since grown into a multimillion-dollar production. Pilot Gene Dennis, 78, remembers the snowstorm that almost caused him to miss the 1972 fiesta. He had to rearrange his flight plans from Michigan so he could make it to Albuquerque in time. The weather was perfect when he got to New Mexico, said Dennis, who flew under the alias “Captain Phairweather.” He was quoted at the time as saying he had brought good weather with him. He was on the hook again, as pilots hope predictions for the rest of opening weekend are fair. “Ballooning is infectious,” Dennis said, describing being aloft like drifting in a dream, quietly observing the countryside below.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Struggling taxi drivers have gotten $225 million in debt relief over the past two weeks, but thousands more loans have yet to be refinanced after a cabbie debt crisis, officials and advocates said Friday as the relief program deadline was extended. Over 1,000 loans have been refinanced in the first two weeks of the program. It was announced in August after drivers appealed for years for help with a crippling economic crunch surrounding the city’s famous yellow cabs. “Every time we raised our hands to hail a cab at a curb, they responded. Now it’s time for us to stand with them, and that’s what we’ve done,” Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said at a news conference where scores of drivers lined the steps of City Hall. Still, the major lender participating in the program, Marblegate Asset Management, said it had yet to hear from the borrowers of roughly 2,000 eligible loans. An estimated 850 loans handled by other lenders haven’t been addressed, according to Bhairavi Desai of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers’ union. Officials urged drivers with Marblegate loans to inquire by the program deadline – now extended by a week, to next Friday – and encouraged other lenders to participate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One week before election officials begin processing by-mail ballots in the closely watched Southern swing state, the GOP is pursuing its latest legal challenge to the electoral procedures established by the Democrat-led State Board of Elections. The North Carolina Republican Party filed two motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the board from enforcing its prohibition of county election officials scrutinizing signatures on absentee voting documents. The legal challenge follows the state board’s July rejection of a Republican Party request to authorize county officials to compare signatures on absentee ballot request forms and container envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Citing concerns that the proposal would create unequal voting access, the board denied the request in a 3-2 party-line vote, with three Democrats voting against signature checks and two Republicans voting in favor. “Why the Board of Elections continues to undermine the integrity of our elections is inexplicable,” North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said. “The NCGOP is pursuing this lawsuit to ensure our elections remain secure and free from doubt.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A man accused in the fatal hit-and-run of a teenager after a small-town street dance is now charged with murder, after prosecutors say he intentionally ran over the 18-year-old, according to upgraded charges made public Friday. Shannon Brandt, 41, was initially charged with criminal vehicular homicide in the Sept. 18 killing of Cayler Ellingson, but that charge has been dropped. The new charge – murder with a dangerous weapon – is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction. Brandt is also charged with leaving the scene of a crash that resulted in death. According to a probable cause affidavit released Friday, Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that if it had been a total accident, he wouldn’t be so scared, “but I know it was more than that.” Brandt initially told authorities that there had been a political argument and that Ellingson was part of a “Republican extremist group.” Many conservatives took to social media to decry the alleged motive in Ellingson’s death. But investigators have said that the case was not political in nature and that there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was a Republican extremist. Brandt’s attorney, Mark Friese, said Friday that he would not comment yet because the Ellingson family is grieving, the community is in mourning, and he hasn’t received all of the case background.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Medical marijuana patients are happier with the state’s program than they once were, but they continue to face high prices and a shortage of doctors who can recommend cannabis, according to a new study. The report from Ohio State University’s Drug Enforcement and Policy Center found more than half of survey respondents reported some level of satisfaction with the medical cannabis program, including 15.3% who were “extremely satisfied.” About 35% of people were dissatisfied with the program, an improvement from 55% last year. The center conducted its survey in April and March and received more than 2,500 responses. The high cost of medical marijuana in Ohio is the biggest problem, according to patients. While the price of plant product in the state declined 17% during the past year, costs in neighboring Michigan dropped even further, making a trip out of state more appealing than buying from an Ohio dispensary. During a 13-month period, an Ohio patient on average paid $4.08 more per gram than someone in Michigan. “They see a huge price difference between Michigan and Ohio, and I think that’s one of the things that might be driving dissatisfaction,” said Jana Hrdinova, the study’s author and administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A teenager was killed and another wounded in a shooting at a high school homecoming football game Friday night, police said. The victims, both 17, were shot during the event at McLain High School for Science and Technology shortly before 10 p.m., according to a statement by the Tulsa Police Department posted on Twitter and Facebook. “When Officers arrived, we found two victims amongst the crowd of hundreds. One 17-year-old male was pronounced dead at the scene,” the post said. The surviving victim was taken to a hospital in critical condition but has improved to stable condition, the statement said. Several officers and a K-9 unit searched nearby neighborhoods but were not immediately able to find the suspected shooter, who ran away from the scene, police said. Police said the suspect is believed to be another 17-year-old.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State environmental regulators have issued a $2.7 million fine to an electric charging company over accusations it sold fraudulent credits through the agency’s clean fuels program. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it discovered Thompson Technical Services, or TTS Charging, sold more than $2 million in fraudulent credits, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The program, implemented in 2016, is designed to help the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 37% by 2035. It provides credits as incentives to companies that produce transportation fuels like electricity or biofuels. Those companies can then sell credits to other companies in order for them to comply with state emissions rules. According to DEQ, TTS Charging falsely claimed more than 16,000 in credits in June, alleging it dispensed nearly 15 million kilowatt hours of electricity from three vehicle charging stations. “They hadn’t dispensed any electricity; they hadn’t even set up the charging stations,” said Harry Esteve, a spokesperson for the agency. The company then sold the credits for nearly $1.8 million to oil and natural gas transportation company, Elbow River Marketing, based in Canada. The state agency has revoked TTS Charging’s account with the clean fuels program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Max Baer, the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, has died only months before he was set to retire, the court confirmed Saturday. He was 74. Baer died overnight at his home near Pittsburgh, the court said in a news release. The court didn’t give a reason for his death but called his “sudden passing” a “tremendous loss for the court and all of Pennsylvania.” The court said Justice Debra Todd now becomes chief justice “as the justice of longest and continuous service on the court.” She is the first female chief justice in the commonwealth’s history, a court spokesperson confirmed. “Chief Justice Baer was an influential and intellectual jurist whose unwavering focus was on administering fair and balanced justice,” Todd said in the release. “He was a tireless champion for children, devoted to protecting and providing for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.” Gov. Tom Wolf ordered state flags at commonwealth facilities, public buildings and grounds lowered to half-staff, saying he was “extremely saddened” by the death of such a “respected and esteemed jurist with decades of service to our courts and our commonwealth.” Baer, a Duquesne Law graduate, was an Allegheny County family court judge and an administrative judge in family court before he was elected to the high court in 2003 and became its chief justice last year. Baer also served as deputy attorney general for Pennsylvania from 1975 to 1980 and was in private practice before entering the judiciary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The most closely guarded secret entrusted to the governor may be knowing what happens on the NBC singing competition “The Voice.” For several weeks, it was rumored that Gov. Dan McKee’s daughter, Kara McKee, was lined up for an on-screen audition for the show, which airs on Monday and Tuesday nights. Last week, the governor’s office confirmed that she would be on the show but declined to say more. The Democrat sidestepped direct questions about how well his daughter fares to talk about how wonderful she is. “We’re very proud of our family, and Kara in particular right now – she’s taken over from my mom ... in terms of being the star of the family,” he said. “We’re very proud of Kara and her move to spend the time on a music career that she’s left the corporate world to pursue.” McKee’s 94-year-old mother, Willa McKee, who moved back in with her son’s family, stars in a popular campaign ad whose punchline says that her son isn’t doing too bad “for a governor that lives with his mother.” His daughter, 37, most recently worked in digital operations for TJX, the corporate parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. Why won’t the proud papa talk about how she does on the competition? “We signed all these agreements,” he said, referring to nondisclosure agreements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Gov. Henry McMaster has temporarily suspended campaign activities as he leads the state’s response to Hurricane Ian. McMaster’s campaign said the Republican incumbent canceled a fundraiser scheduled for Friday night in Clemson, as well as an appearance for tailgating before the Clemson Tigers’ football game Saturday. McMaster had been talking with officials across the state and holding daily briefings last week as the state made preparations for the storm, which ravaged Florida and barreled onward to South Carolina’s coast. Politics and hurricanes often collide in the state, where the final months before the November general elections can turn into busy storm seasons. In 2018, both McMaster and his Democratic opponent, then-Rep. James Smith, pulled down their campaign events as Hurricane Florence approached the state. Smith, who was a major in the South Carolina National Guard, was activated during that storm response, tasked with coordinating the distribution of resources across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Friday during her reelection campaign’s lone debate with her Democratic challenger, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, that if reelected she will uphold the state’s abortion ban that provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The Republican governor explained her position simply as “pro-life,” while pledging to push for expanded parental leave in the state and alleviate the toll of inflation on people’s budgets. Smith called Noem’s stance extreme and said it was endangering women’s lives and causing concern among physicians for its lack of clarity on when an abortion is allowed – only to save the life of a pregnant woman. “It’s clear to me that South Dakotans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to an abortion,” Smith said. “We talk about freedom all the time, except the freedom to make this choice.” The gubernatorial race’s lone head-to-head meeting of the two candidates featured Noem touting her record of a hands-off approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith, who is facing an uphill election in the heavily Republican state, cast himself as a moderate. He was quick to point out that the grocery-tax repeal Noem suddenly embraced last week was an initiative he has been pushing for years, and when the state House passed the proposal in March, support from Noem was lacking.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Problems with rape kit evidence testing keep haunting Memphis. A city long plagued by a heavy backlog of untested sexual assault kits was shaken by Cleotha Henderson’s arrest in the killing of Eliza Fletcher after she was abducted during a morning jog last month. So when authorities said his DNA was linked to a rape that occurred nearly a year earlier – charging him separately days after he was arrested in Fletcher’s killing – an outraged city turned to the obvious question: Why was he still on the streets? The case of Henderson, who already has served 20 years in prison for a kidnapping he committed at 16, has reignited criticism of Tennessee’s sexual assault testing process. That has included calls for shorter delays from the testing agency, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and questions about why Memphis didn’t seek to fast-track a kit that could have been tested in days. Instead, it took nearly a year, unearthing key evidence too late to charge Henderson before Fletcher’s killing. The tragic outcome brings back memories from the early 2010s, when Memphis revealed a backlog of about 12,000 untested rape kits that took years to whittle down and led to a lawsuit that’s still ongoing. The new rape charges have spurred another lawsuit accusing the Memphis Police Department of negligence for the delay.\n\nTexas\n\nConroe: A deeply divided federal appeals court has ruled that a Texas judge may start the day with prayer, overturning a district court decision. Judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans split 2-1 in opinions handed down Thursday, reversing a ruling made without a trial by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt. Montgomery County Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack doesn’t force anyone to attend the prayers before court formally opens, Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote for himself and Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt. Mack “takes great pains to convince attendees that they need not watch the ceremony – and that doing so will not affect their cases,” he wrote. Judge E. Grady Jolly responded: “For the majority to find that there is no evidence of coercion, suggests, in my opinion, willful blindness and indisputable error.” He noted that Mack is a Pentecostal minister who made a campaign promise to establish prayer in his courtroom. “He has previously criticized opponents of his prayer ceremony and has acted hostile following a litigant’s noncooperation in the prayer,” Jolly wrote. The Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Mack in 2017 for itself and an anonymous lawyer who said he attended the sessions out of fear that not doing so would hurt his clients.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Russell M. Nelson, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told members of the faith Saturday that abuse was “a grievous sin” that shouldn’t be tolerated and would bring down the wrath of God on perpetrators. Though the leader of the nearly 17 million-member faith did not mention it directly, the remarks were the first on abuse from a senior church leader since the Associated Press published an investigation into how the church handles reports of sexual abuse when brought to its attention. “Let me be perfectly clear: Any kind of abuse of women, children or anyone is an abomination to the Lord,” Nelson, who members of the faith believe is a prophet, said in Salt Lake City at a church conference. The AP’s investigation found the hotline the church uses for abuse reporting can be misused by its leaders to divert accusations away from law enforcement and toward church attorneys. The story, based on sealed records and court cases filed in Arizona and West Virginia, uncovered a host of concerns, including how church officials have cited exemptions to mandatory reporting laws, known as clergy-penitent privilege, as a reason to not report abuse. Since its publication, the church has said the investigation mischaracterizes its policies.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Dispensaries began selling marijuana for legal recreational use over the weekend. FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury, Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland and CeresMED in Burlington were the only retailers ready to begin sales Saturday. A fourth business has been licensed to sell recreational pot but isn’t ready to do so yet. As happened with the rollout of recreational marijuana sales in other states and in Canada, Vermont’s inaugural weekend was “more of a soft opening,” as more product manufacturers and testing facilities come online and as more people harvest the plant, said James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board. Vermont joins 14 other states with legal adult-use cannabis sales, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Four others – Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia – and Washington, D.C., have legalized the use of recreational marijuana, but sales haven’t started there yet. Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board prioritized review and waived licensing fees for social equity applicants. Such applicants are Black or Hispanic or from communities that historically have been disproportionately affected by cannabis being outlawed or who have been or had a family member who has been incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.\n\nVirginia\n\nGala: He won in the dogfights of World War II, he won in the Olympic boxing ring, and he won in Virginia Supreme Court. Now a stretch of highway in Botetourt County is named in honor of Norvel LaFallette Ray Lee. Descendants of Lee recently traveled to his birthplace from as far as Alaska to unveil a placard along U.S. 220 that details his life and accomplishments, on what would have been his 98th birthday. “I hope this marker will inspire people to learn more about Norvel, his extraordinary achievements and his place in the history of our country,” said state Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. “I want to acknowledge this man who overcame the adversities of segregation to become a Tuskegee Airmen and a gold medalist in the Olympics.” Born in Eagle Rock in 1924, Lee won fights by air and in the boxing ring, including Olympic gold in 1952, but is known also for taking a stand against segregation on his way home from the 1948 Olympics. “While returning from the 1948 Olympics, traveling by train, he was asked to give up his seat to a white person,” Austin said. “Mr. Lee declined to do so and was arrested. Eventually the Virginia Supreme Court did the right thing and ruled in Mr. Lee’s favor.” Undefeated in Virginia Supreme Court on what became a landmark civil rights case, Lee went on to retire from boxing with two Golden Glove titles and a 100-5 win-loss record, said the Rev. Nelson Harris of Heights Community Church in Roanoke.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A woman who was sexually assaulted by a police officer has filed a tort claim against the city. The woman is seeking $1 million in damages, alleging “red flags” related to now ex-police Officer Nathan Nash’s behavior were ignored, KREM-TV reports. Nash was convicted in August on one count of third-degree rape and one count of second-degree rape in two separate incidents in which he was on duty. The woman intending to sue says in the claim that the city’s hiring, training and supervision of Nash was inadequate and a proximate cause of her injuries. The city allowed Nash to use his power and police uniform to prey on women he encountered during the performance of his duties, according to the claim. The city has about two months to respond. Nash is in custody at the Spokane County Detention Center awaiting a mid-October sentencing for the rape convictions. Throughout his trial, Nash maintained his innocence. He was first charged in 2019 when a woman accused him of rape while investigating her case. Another woman in 2021 told police about a similar experience.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is getting a $13.8 million funding boost from the state to help finish construction of a baseball stadium. Gov. Jim Justice announced the contribution Thursday from the state Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant program. “This has been a long time coming, and I am so proud to play a small part in getting this project across the finish line,” Justice said. “They’ve been talking about building a baseball stadium since I was a brown-haired kid playing golf at Marshall back in the ’70s. Finally, it’s going to happen, and this community can get the monkey off its back.” Marshall has never had an on-campus baseball stadium. The new facility will be built across the street from Marshall’s football stadium. The stadium is expected to cost about $23 million. The city of Huntington and Marshall are contributing nearly $10 million, the governor’s office said in a statement. Construction is scheduled to begin this month, with a tentative completion date of March 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two lawsuits filed last week argue that election clerks should be allowed to accept absentee ballots that are missing portions of witness addresses – the next step in the ongoing legal battle that has pit conservatives against liberals in the battleground state. The lawsuits, filed three days apart on Tuesday and Friday, come after a judge in Waukesha County circuit court in September sided with Republicans and said election clerks are barred from filling in missing information on the form that serves as an envelope for absentee ballots. The judge struck down guidance issued by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, in place for six years, saying that clerks could fill in missing information. The judge agreed with Republicans that there is nothing in law allowing clerks to do that. The practice, known as ballot curing, was unchallenged until after Donald Trump’s narrow loss in 2020, when nearly 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots, and COVID-19 vaccines weren’t available yet. Absent any guidance, there is confusion among election officials about how much of an address must be provided by the witness to allow for the ballot to be counted. Those with partial witness addresses should be accepted, not rejected, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state doubled its wind-power generating capacity from 2019 to 2021 and is looking to add more wind farms in the next five years. The Casper Star Tribune reports researchers at the University of Wyoming say that boost in power generation is like adding another coal-fired power plant. The increase has pushed Wyoming’s wind-power generating capacity from about 1,600 to about 3,200 megawatts and from 17th to 14th in the nation in wind-power capacity. Enough future wind farms have been proposed to the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to nearly triple the state’s wind-power capacity. The University of Wyoming report released in June sought to measure the economic impacts of wind projects in the state. It found that building another 6,000 megawatts of wind capacity would support close to 1,600 long-term jobs. It would also inject $1.2 billion into the state economy during construction and add another estimated $210 million annually. Researchers said that includes $89 million in government revenue. Additionally, if the turbines were built in Wyoming, the revenue produced in the state could be even more.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/01/17/college-republicans-crnc-trump-republican-party-gop-turning-point-usa/4476649002/", "title": "College Republicans, CRNC fight over Donald Trump, future of GOP", "text": "The College Republicans are worried – partially about their Democratic peers on campus but also about other young people who call themselves Republican.\n\nThe more moderate among them say they fear far-right students' “antics” will corrupt the party. Their counterparts argue the party is too stodgy to capture the attention of undecided voters. In California and Washington, the groups fractured over who should lead them.\n\nUnderlying the college conservatives’ fears: that the Republican Party as a whole is in trouble.\n\nFor young Republicans, embracing a conservative identity while enrolled in college is a decision to be an outsider. Many of them say they feel ostracized on their campus for their beliefs, which fosters an “us vs. them” mentality.\n\nYoung voters in 2020:'I think they will decide the race'\n\nThat might partially explain why they host events such as “affirmative action bake sales,” in which they sell treats at different prices based on a person’s race. These types of events are meant to rile college communities, and they often succeed. Students both broadcast their views against affirmative action and generate as much attention as they can.\n\nAt the University of Washington last May, a group calling itself College Republicans hosted such a bake sale. The campus conservatives found themselves the subject of national headlines, and the statewide organization of College Republicans denounced what the group did. The state organization instead recognized a different group – the Husky College Republicans. The original group declined to speak to USA TODAY unless members were offered anonymity. Members said they feared for their safety.\n\nJack Pickett, the western vice chairman at the College Republican National Committee, was part of the College Republicans at the University of Washington and also led the statewide group. He was involved in the decision to start over.\n\nThe chapter, he said, crossed the line a couple of times, and the bake sale was the final straw. Pickett recalled he was not happy when leaders brought Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right speaker, to campus in 2017. Outside that event, a man protesting was shot by someone who had come to see Yiannopoulos.\n\nPickett considers himself a conservative but said he didn’t initially support Donald Trump's campaign for president. (He now does.) He threw his support behind businesswoman and politician Carly Fiorina in 2016.\n\nHe wasn't alone:Trump's 2016 candidacy produced unusual divide in College Republican clubs\n\nHis critics have seized upon what he described as a more traditional type of conservatism, calling him a “Republican in Name Only.” People have attacked him online for his weight and claim he doesn’t deserve his position. The old group of college leaders he helped to oust still meets.\n\nBattling over the identity of a college group is vexing, Pickett said. It distracts from a larger, perhaps more difficult goal: recruiting new conservatives.\n\n“It's very difficult to do that when you have a group who's misusing your name and working almost intentionally, it often seems, to drive people away with their antics,\" Pickett said. \"That's not something that anyone, even right-leaning students, want to be a part of.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee doesn't appear worried about potential divisions in its youth movement. The party is running an effort to register voters called \"Make Campus Great Again.\"\n\n\"When it comes to issues college students care about, like securing a job after graduation, the choice is clear: a booming economy under President Trump or a government takeover of every aspect of their lives under Democrat leadership,\" RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in an email.\n\nCollege Republicans: 'Inflammatory' or conservative?\n\nThe split between conservative policy wonks and energized activists is one that Amy Binder, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego, and Jeffrey Kidder, a sociologist at Northern Illinois University, have studied for years. They're writing a book on student activism.\n\nThey found individual students straddle those lines. They join the traditional College Republican groups because of the political connections they can build, but they might also join a group such as Turning Point USA. Founded by Charlie Kirk in 2012, when he was 18, the conservative group is known for its attention-grabbing tactics at colleges. It started the Professor Watchlist, a project meant to track, “expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda.” It hosts summits often attended by major figures in the Trump administration, including the president, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nKidder said such groups probably do a better job of appealing to students interested in more than traditional, campaigning-style politics.\n\nConservative and liberal students tend to organize differently, Binder said. Students on the left may feel more comfortable within the university. Many have student affairs offices directed toward minority students, such as black or LBGTQ cultural centers. Conservative students may be drawn off campus to groups such as Turning Point, which have a lot of money and resources to help them organize.\n\nJoaquin Romero, 21, a junior studying economics at the University of New Mexico, chairs the New Mexico Federation of College Republicans. He has long been involved in state and city politics. In New Mexico, the state with the largest percentage of Hispanics in the country, Democrats hold all seats in Congress, the governor's office and both the state House and Senate.\n\nRomero said his goal is to shift the college Republican group away from the incendiary approach some have taken. In 2017, the UNM group invited Yiannopoulos to campus, and police intervened to break up protests. Romero said he understands some people appreciate watching things burn, but he sees those efforts as counterproductive.\n\n\"Things like the Milo event, where you have someone on stage that says inflammatory things that are in my opinion not even conservative,\" he said, \"it not only drives people away, but it also ignites the wrong kind of people.\"\n\nThe goal, Romero said, should be to recruit people who want to carry on the \"conservatism of (Ronald) Reagan.\" That lasts longer, he argued, than the furor generated over provocative speakers.\n\nAt San Diego State, 'America first'\n\nInfighting among conservative students in California prompted a majority of the state's college Republicans to start a new organization altogether. They split off from the California College Republicans about a year ago to create the California Federation of College Republicans. That group’s chairman, Matt Ronnau, also heads the chapter at University of California-Berkeley.\n\nInitially, Ronnau said, the divide among College Republicans was between those eager to embrace President Trump and those who wanted to embrace a more traditional model of conservatism. The split came down to differences in how to run the organization. The new group, the federation, has 30 chapters and is recognized by the College Republican National Committee. The old group, the California College Republicans, didn’t return a request for comment.\n\nRonnau describes himself as a member of the “Trumpian camp” but said many of the federation’s members are not. Some have swung far to the right. The San Diego State College Republicans, who belong to the federation, describe themselves as “unapologetically Nationalist + America first” in the group’s Twitter profile. They have retweeted Michelle Malkin, a controversial figure who supports far-right writer Nicholas Fuentes and VDARE, an anti-immigration website popular among white nationalists.\n\nOliver Krvaric, president of the San Diego State group, said a split exists between establishment Republicans and the next generation.\n\nKrvaric, 21, a senior studying international security and conflict resolution, said he'd rather the group focus less on helping conservative students land political jobs, a traditional role for College Republican groups, and instead work to wage the \"culture war.\" For instance, although he wouldn't say where he stood on issues such as same-sex marriage, he said generally men and women are better suited for different roles. Many group members oppose abortion rights and hold hard-line views on immigration.\n\nRonnau said he is unconcerned that the San Diego chapter's views could be seen as reflective of the federation as a whole.\n\n“We want to let clubs operate kind of more or less the way they see fit,” Ronnau said. “San Diego State is much farther to the right than other clubs in our state federation, but we all coexist together.”\n\nRonnau doesn’t expect a return to the era of Republicanism that would be familiar to the Mitt Romney- or John McCain-types. He said many young people support the president, and more young people will step up to push the “right-wing populist agenda.”\n\nEditorial board:Forget Donald Trump, Republicans. Save the GOP for the sake of your party's future\n\nColumbus Day post rocks University of Maine\n\nKirk and his fellow Republicans used to be some of the most vocal conservative voices on college campuses. But some young Republicans view him as too moderate.\n\nJeremiah Childs, vice president for the College Republican group at the University of Maine, pushes an “America first” agenda that's unabashedly Trumpian in support of strict immigration policies. The group often posts criticism of Democratic presidential hopefuls and support for gun rights and the military.\n\nHe said groups such as Turning Point spend too much time talking about economic issues rather than cultural ones, such as the anti-abortion movement. Childs said he worries about the rise of concepts such as nontraditional gender roles and “third-wave feminism.”\n\nIn October, the group posted a message on Facebook in support of Columbus Day, describing some Native American tribes as “corrupted by rampant ritual sacrifice and cannibalism.” The post generated backlash. Childs said that the intent was not to rile and that he didn't think Native Americans in the area cared about the controversy over Columbus Day.\n\nAn indigenous student group protested the post, according to Inside Higher Education. A tribal ambassador of the Penobscot Nation told an NBC affiliate she was in favor of stripping Columbus' name from the holiday, calling him a \"war criminal.\"\n\nChilds said the outrage was the result of \"left-wing activists.\"\n\nThe College Republicans at the University of Maine recently also came under fire for their plans to bring in Malkin. The hotel hosting the event pulled out, but the students found a new venue, Childs said.\n\nThe group's adviser resigned after the students invited Malkin. Dan Demeritt, spokesman for the University of Maine, said the club isn't official without one. Childs said they have candidates lined up.\n\nMalkin supports Nicholas Fuentes, a far-right writer. Though he said he is not a white nationalist, he attended the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a gathering of white nationalists. Counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed after James Alex Field drove a car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.\n\nFuentes has joked the Holocaust didn’t happen. His fans have coordinated attempts to heckle speakers from Turning Point USA and another conservative group, the Young America Foundation, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nChilds said his group does not endorse Fuentes and is not associated with him.\n\nThe Maine group posted a poll featuring Kirk of Turning Point USA, whom Childs described as a “Country Club Republican,” and Fuentes.\n\n“The major question,” the Maine students wrote, “seems to be should the Republican Party move towards 'Nationalism/America First,' or towards 'Libertarianism' with a softer approach towards social issues and immigration?” In the students’ poll, Fuentes represented the first option, Kirk the second. Eighty-two percent of the 5,200 who voted went with Fuentes, the rest for Kirk. (These types of internet polls can be easily gamed, especially by young digital natives.)\n\nChilds said he doesn’t think conservative critics understand the circumstances of poor and rural Americans. He said they probably come from prosperous backgrounds.\n\nChilds' sentiment reiterates what many of these young conservatives say about each other: They just don’t get it.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Foundation.

Carr, chosen on Sunday, is a senior Republican on the commission most recently known for criticizing \"Saturday Night Live\" for an appearance by Vice President Kamala Harris, saying it was a violation of the \"equal time\" rule governing candidate appearances on television.\n\nMeanwhile peril continued to mount Monday for Trump's pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. Florida lawyer Joel Leppard, who represented two women in the House Ethics Committee investigation into the former representative, said the women alleged Gaetz paid them for sex, according to multiple media reports.\n\nOne of the women also said she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old, according to reports from the Washington Post and ABC News.\n\nThe Justice Department's investigation into sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz ended without charges. Gaetz, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned from Congress Wednesday, two days before a House Ethics Committee report about the probe was scheduled for release.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaetz's House office, Jacob Bliss, directed USA TODAY to a statement from Trump transition spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer, who described the allegations as a \"baseless\" attempt to derail Trump's upcoming administration.\n\nHere's the latest on Trump's latest choices.\n\nDepartment of Transportation pick former 'Real World' contestant\n\nDuffy's nomination marks the second Fox connection among those who have been chosen for nomination to the incoming administration.\n\nPete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was chosen to be Trump's Secretary of Defense. Hegseth is currently embroiled in sexual assault and far-right extremism scandals involving his tattoos. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault claims and said he only reached a settlement agreement with the accuser to protect his job in 2020. About the tattoos that led to his removal from a National Guard assignment, he has said they were \"just a Christian symbol.\"\n\nDuffy first appeared on television as a cast member on MTV's \"The Real World\" in 1997 and later appeared in \"Road Rules: All Stars\" in 1998 and \"Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons\" in 2002.\n\nDuffy served as a congressman from Wisconsin's 7th congressional district from 2011 to 2019 and was a frequent Fox News guest during his time in the House.

Carr is the senior Republican commissioner at the FCC and authored a chapter of Project 2025.\n\nCarr wrote in the guide that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants immunity to tech companies that moderate user-generated content, should be stripped to end content moderation that some conservatives view as censorship.\n\n“Congress should do so by ensuring that Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,” Carr wrote\n\nCarr supports banning TikTok, claiming that it poses a national security threat, although the president-elect joined the popular social media platform in June.\n\nCarr wrote in Project 2025 that the app “provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"\n\nCarr also wrote that the FCC should expedite its review and approval of Starlink internet satellites from tech baron and Trump acolyte Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nIn a post announcing the Carr's appointment on Truth Social, Trump said Carr is a \"warrior for Free Speech.\"\n\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\n\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\n\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title.

Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America’s middle and lower class.\n\n“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel.\n\nThe strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was “impressed,” and called it “an excellent start.”\n\nSanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party’s infrastructure.\n\n“Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” Sanders questioned. “Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris: 'When we lose an election, we accept the results'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n“The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,” Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. \"The fight for our country is always worth it.\"\n\n\"I am so proud of the campaign we ran,\" Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause.\n\nHarris called on young people to continue to fight to make the “world a better place” while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control.\n\n“While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect.\"\n\n\"Do not despair,\" she added. \"This is a time to mobilize.\"\n\nWhen Harris said the country may be entering a dark period, a smattering of attendees responded, \"We are.\"\n\nTrump was announced the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sweeping many of the key swing states and widening his support among young men, Black men and Hispanic voters to prevail.\n\nAs attendees filtered out, younger Harris supporters and staffers shed tears as her time as a candidate came to a close.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden invited Trump to White House in phone call\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Trump earlier in the day to congratulate the former president on his victory in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHe also invited Trump to meet with him in the White House.

Harris also called Trump to congratulate him, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTop Harris adviser says VP faced ‘deep hole’ in race against Trump\n\nHarris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe called the vice president’s loss to Donald Trump “devastating\" and pointed to a “deep hole” Harris faced after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n“It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with Kamala Harris,” Plouffe said in a post on X, commending the “amazing staff” led by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon “who left it on the field for their country.”\n\n“We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you,” Plouffe said.\n\nPlouffe, who worked as President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, was among a group of former Obama staffers tapped for top campaign leadership positions after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. Harris mounted a condensed 108-day campaign that ultimately fell well short of victory.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nGeorge W. Bush congratulates Trump\n\nFormer President George W. Bush congratulated Donald Trump and JD Vance on their win and thanked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their service to the country in a statement Wednesday morning.\n\n“The strong turnout in this election is a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions,” Bush said. “We join our fellow citizens in praying for the success of our new leaders at all levels of government.\n\nThe former Republican president did not endorse either Trump or Harris in the election. His daughter, Barbara Bush, knocked doors for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and his vice president, Dick Cheney, endorsed the Democratic candidate.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWho will serve in a second Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election marked the end of a long, divisive campaign that will see the Republican return to the White House just four years after voters ejected him from the job.\n\nWith the campaign behind him, Trump can now turn his attention to putting together a cabinet and a staff to carry out his agenda.\n\nA familiar cast of characters – some of whom had jobs in his first administration – stand ready to serve. Others − like the many who officials from his first administration who subsequently questioned his fitness for office − not so much.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s in and who isn't.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nWhat is Project 2025 that outlines extreme positions?\n\nThe controversial conservative playbook Project 2025, a highly criticized \"presidential transition project\" created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement.\n\nTrump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to \"know nothing about Project 2025\" despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will Kamala Harris speak to supporters?\n\nHarris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race.\n\nHarris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaker Johnson: Border, inflation issues helped keep House in GOP hands\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said.\n\n“The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,” Johnson said in a statement. “I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.\"\n\nRFK Jr. says he wants to clear out FDA departments\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out \"entire departments\" at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration.\n\n\"I can get the corruption out of the agencies,\" Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. \"That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.\"\n\nThe president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump \"promised\" him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that.\n\n\"He's going to help make America healthy again,\" Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. \"He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.\"\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulates Trump\n\nJeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday.\n\n“Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities” Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. “Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.”\n\nThe good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post’s decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate – a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the decision to nix presidential endorsements, according to the Post.\n\nIn an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a “perception of non-independence” and bias.\n\n− Chris Cann\n\nMitch McConnell congratulates Trump, grateful filibuster is 'secure'\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for “running a sharper operation this time.”\n\nMcConnell, who’s been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he “had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.”\n\n\"Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster “will stand.”\n\n“There won’t be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we’ll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don’t like a decision they make,” he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNetanyahu, Zelenskyy speak with Trump\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a \"warm and cordial\" conversation with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday and was among the first world leaders to speak with him after his election victory. Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and \"the Iranian threat.\"\n\nTrump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times. Trump broke with years of U.S. policy when he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their future capital. It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza.\n\nDozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia.\n\n\"I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.\"\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nHistoric comeback for Trump, a once and future president\n\nFour years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he’s a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication.\n\nNow he will become the second president in history − the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago − to serve nonconsecutive terms.\n\nA politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world. The convicted felon is now the incoming commander in chief.\n\nWeeks of polling had showed the candidates competing in a razor-close election, but in the end Trump won over enough pivotal states with his focus on inflation and immigration. Harris won much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinched victories in the South. But Trump also picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushing him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the race. Read more here on how Trump's historic comeback happened.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nWhat happens with Donald Trump's criminal cases?\n\nThe election victory will delay and possibly wipe out Trump’s four pending criminal cases, according to legal experts. Trump has made clear he would derail the efforts of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in his two federal cases. And action in two state cases in New York and Georgia are likely to be postponed until he is done serving in the White House.\n\n“I think we are in uncharted territory,” said Alexander Reinert, a Cardozo School of Law professor, said of the state cases.\n\nTrump has said he could fire Smith or pardon himself. “It’s so easy − I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24.\n\nWhat the election results mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis.\n\nACLU ready to challenge Trump’s `mass deportation’ plan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many of Donald Trump’s controversial policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a plan for Trump’s next term. The ACLU was the first group in 2017 to challenge Trump’s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, one of 434 legal actions it took against the first Trump administration.\n\nThis time, Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the ACLU is ready to fight Trump’s vow to seek retribution against his enemies, to launch a “mass deportation” of at least 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization and other promises.\n\n“We are ready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office,” Romero said in a statement. “When President-elect Trump targets immigrants, dissidents and his political opponents we will challenge him in the courts, in state legislatures and in the streets.”\n\nVance, mom all smiles after victory\n\nVice president-elect JD Vance thanked supporters after he and Trump claimed victory early Wednesday morning. And his mother, Beverly Aikins, returned to Facebook on Wednesday to celebrate her son's win. Aikins took a break from social media in July after seeing \"vitriol and hate\" toward her son, including from critics in Vance's hometown of Middletown, where she still lives.\n\n\"Too big to rig,\" she wrote. \"Popular vote by more than five million. Two hundred seventy seven electoral votes and still counting. Trump Vance 2024.\"\n\n− Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nBomb threats linked to Russia did not alter election, official says\n\nBomb threats believed to be emanating from Russia interrupted voting Tuesday across numerous battleground states, but a top U.S. cybersecurity official said they didn’t have a material impact on the election or voters’ ability to cast their ballots. Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a midnight press briefing that Tuesday's election did see some \"minor\" disruptive activities, including polling station evacuations and delays.\n\nEasterly and other officials said the hoax bomb threats were sent to at least four states and were all deemed to be \"non-credible.\"\n\n“The point is this did not impact the ability of voters to cast their ballots or for their votes to be counted as cast,” Easterly said, commending the election officials on the ground in the states. “Ultimately they were able to demonstrate extensive resilience based on their preparations for it. … Overall I would call this a good news story for democracy.”\n\nEight states vote to prohibit noncitizen voting\n\nEight states approved constitutional amendments or ballot initiatives Tuesday to prohibit noncitizens from voting, a key Republican priority even though state and federal laws already prohibit it and despite studies showing it almost never happens. All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add “only” citizens may vote.\n\nNorth Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\n“It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,” Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. “Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.”\n\nStudies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent. A Georgia audit of voter rolls this year found 20 noncitizens among 8.2 million registered voters.\n\nCenter for American Women and Politics: `Progress is not inevitable’\n\nHarris’ candidacy demonstrated much of the advantages women have when they run for office, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. She was a formidable fundraiser. She connected with voters on issues important to her and to them. Her identify gave her a unique perspective on overlooked issues, the research center said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the race also exemplified research that shows obstacles female candidates face, primarily unequal expectations. That’s particularly true for women of color, the center said. While women have held nearly every political office in America, they still hold fewer than a third of all political seats at every level of office – and still haven’t reached the highest office in the land.\n\n“Progress is not inevitable,” the center said. “We have made great strides, yes, but there are many steps left on the path to parity.”\n\nCan Trump run again in 2028?\n\nTrump has run for president three times, winning the office in 2016 and now in 2024. So, can he run again in 2028? The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits one person from serving more than two terms as president.\n\nAll presidents served no more than two terms until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected president four times from 1932 to 1944. In 1947, two years after Roosevelt's death, a push began in the House of Representative to limit presidents to two terms. After some revisions by the Senate, the proposed amendment was approved and sent out to states, It was rtified on Feb. 27, 1951.\n\n− Chad Murphy, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nFrom pariah to president:From pariah to president: Donald Trump rises from the ashes to reclaim the White House\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost the election\n\nAn appearance on ABC's \"The View\" last month provided a friendly forum for Harris to introduce herself to Americans unfamiliar with her story. But Harris struggled to explain what she would do differently than President Joe Biden. “Not a thing that comes to mind,” the incumbent vice president told the hosts.\n\nFollowing Trump’s victory over Harris, that television moment underscored a fatal flaw of Harris’ campaign that doomed her election bid – an inability to separate herself from an unpopular president whose approval ratings have hovered around 40% for most of his four years in the White House.

He later revealed WWE co-founder Linda McMahon is his pick for education secretary.\n\nAnd on Monday, he picked Fox Business host and fellow former reality TV star Sean Duffy for Secretary of Transportation and Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nMeanwhile Trump stood by his decision Tuesday to nominate former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, saying he would not reconsider the pick, according to Reuters.\n\nThis comes as files containing witness statements with damaging testimony against Gaetz were hacked on Monday, according to an email obtained by the USA TODAY Network. This included a unredacted deposition of a woman who reportedly claimed she had sex with the congressman when she was 17.

Kennedy, Jr., who has previously spread misinformation about vaccines and the COVID-19 virus.\n\n\"America is facing a healthcare crisis, and there may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Dr. Oz will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.\"\n\nOz worked as a heart surgeon until appearing as a health expert on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in the 1990s and by 1999 starring in \"The Dr. Oz Show\" for 13 seasons. The physician has offered insight on various health sectors, including vitamin companies.\n\nHoward Lutnick picked as commerce secretary\n\nTrump said he plans to nominate Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to serve as commerce secretary under his second administration.\n\nThe Wall Street billionaire is expected to offer insight relating to job creation and economic growth, pending Senate approval. Lutnick, 63, has already been working to fill 4,000 political positions in the federal government alongside Trump transition team co-chair Linda McMahon.\n\nThe president-elect also said Lutnick would lead his tariff and trade agenda, campaign promises that were central in his White House bid. Lutnick has said he agrees with the president-elect’s policies on immigration, cryptocurrency and tariffs on imported goods.\n\nHe also said he agreed to increase his involvement in the Republican's presidential campaign following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people, and the abduction of more than 250 hostages.\n\nLinda McMahon picked as education secretary\n\nTrump also named former wrestling executive Linda McMahon to be his new secretary of education.\n\nPending Senate approval, the former head of the Small Business Administration would lead the Education Department, which administers federal student aid programs, offers some funding for public schools and collects data on U.S. education. Trump said he aims to close the department and redistribute most services to state-level education officials.\n\n\"We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort,\" Trump said in the statement Tuesday.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, McMahon served as administrator of the Small Business Administration under the original Trump administration. In 2010, she ran as the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Connecticut before losing to current Democratic Sen.

He ran unopposed and there were no objections before the unanimous voice vote.\n\nIt's also not the final say on the matter. Johnson still must notch a majority of votes from the 435-person chamber during a public floor vote in early January that will keep him in a job that also means he's second in line for the presidency after Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\n- Karissa Waddick and Riley Beggin\n\nDemocratic senator 'speechless' over Gaetz nomination\n\nSen.

Matt Gaetz, a firebrand lawmaker who has been a harsh critic of the Justice Department even as he was investigated by it, as attorney general.\n\nThe Florida Republican has been a vocal critic of the department from his seat on the Judiciary Committee and a staunch defender of Trump. Gaetz accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of weaponizing the department and said he agreed with special counsel Robert Hur's decision not to charge President Joe Biden for mishandling classified documents because he was \"senile.\" Gaetz also accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of being \"blissfully ignorant\" about how agents ran their investigations.\n\nGaetz demonstrated his willingness to fight the Washington establishment by opposing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and nearly scuffling with other lawmakers on the House floor during the dispute.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that senators will have a responsibility to seriously consider Matt Gaetz and any other nominees from President-elect Trump.\n\n“I assume we’ll have some questions for him,” Cornyn told reporters Wednesday when asked about the Florida congressman whom Trump announced he'd nominee to be attorney general.\n\nAsked about the House Ethics Committee's investigation into Gaetz for sexual misconduct, Cornyn said, “Well that might come up,”\n\n“I don’t know whether there’s any basis to it or not,” Cornyn said. “So I’m sure we’ll be asking a lot of questions.”\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump AG nominee Gaetz was probed in sex trafficking investigation\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who president-elect Donald Trump picked as his attorney general Wednesday, is being probed by the House Ethics Committee as a part of an ongoing investigation that includes allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus member and close Trump ally was also under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for allegations that he had sexual relations with a minor and paid for her travel and allegedly was introduced to him by a Joel Greenberg, a one-time friend who is serving an 11-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to sex trafficking in 2022. In February 2023, the DOJ ended the investigation without charging Gaetz.\n\n- Sam Woodward and Karissa Waddick\n\nMarco Rubio given nod for Secretary of State\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday confirmed he's chosen Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as Secretary of State in his next administration.\n\nRubio has deep foreign policy experience and has transformed from a Trump opponent to a close ally who was a finalist to serve as Trump's vice president.\n\nHe is currently the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio, a Cuban American, would be the first Latino person to serve as Secretary of State.\n\nRubio has expressed support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia, but voted against additional aid for the country last year. He recently said the war in Ukraine is going to end with \"a negotiated settlement,\" something Trump has also supported. He's also advocated for a tough approach to American adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.Trump and Rubio, 53, ran against each other in the 2016 Republican primary, which turned nasty as they lobbed insults at each other. But they patched up their relationship and worked together on shared foreign policy goals during Trump’s first administration. They grew closer during the 2024 campaign, when Rubio was on the short list to be Trump’s running mate and campaigned relentlessly for him.\n\nA fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who grew up in West Miami. He adds diversity to Trump’s Cabinet and foreign policy chops. A senator since 2011, he serves on the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees and has been one of the most outspoken lawmakers on confronting China and U.S. adversaries around the world.\n\nRubio is expected to easily gain Senate confirmation, with lawmakers from both parties already announcing their support for his nomination.\n\n- Riley Beggin and Zac Anderson\n\nMark Warner says he'll evaluate Cabinet nominees on individual basis\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he will evaluate at Trump's cabinet nominees on an individual basis. But he does have a preference for the next Secretary of State.\n\n\"I don't want to jump in front of the president-elect,\" Warner told reporters Wednesday. \"But should he go ahead and nominate my friend Marco Rubio? I think that'd be a very strong choice.\"\n\nTogether, Warner and Rubio serve as chair and vice-chair of the House intelligence committee.\n\nRubio is expected to be named as Trump's pick for the position, according to reports from CNN and New York Times.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nGOP wins control of the House\n\nRepublicans have won both the House and the Senate, giving the GOP total control over Congress for at least the next two years and creating a friendly path for President-elect Donald Trump's priorities.\n\nThe GOP will have a majority in the 435-member House after defending enough key seats in New York, California and other swing districts that had appeared more competitive before Election Day than they ultimately were, according to multiple networks tracking the results. Republicans also have taken control of the Senate by toppling Democratic senators in Montana and Ohio and prevailing in other closely watched races.\n\nTheir victory sets up a Republican trifecta in Washington for the next two years, laying the groundwork for Trump and the party to implement their priorities without major resistance.\n\nJohn Thune will be next Senate Majority Leader\n\nSen. John Thune will be the next Senate Majority Leader. He won 29-24 in a secret ballot election.- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump backers lament Thune's election as Senate majority leader\n\nTrump hasn't said anything - yet - but allies are already squawking about John Thune's election as Senate Republican majority leader.\n\nTrump World has feuded for years with Thune, seeing him as a clone of frequent Trump critic Mitch McConnell. Trump himself tried, unsuccessfully, to field a GOP primary challenger to Thune in 2022.\n\nThe president-elect did not weigh in on the Senate majority leader race, but prominent allies campaigned against Thune in favor of Florida Senator Rick Scott.\n\nAfter Thune prevailed, Trump backer Charlie Kirk said on X that Thune \"has a short window to show us he will support President Trump, fill his cabinet, confirm his judges, and pass his agenda.\"\n\n\"If he does, we will support him,\" Kirk said. \"If he doesn't, we will work to remove him.\"\n\nBuckle up.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nRick Scott is out on the first ballot in the election for the Senate majority leader\n\nScott received the fewest votes in the secret ballot election despite a public pressure campaign from conservative media and Trump allies.\n\nNow senators will move into a second round of votes to determine whether Sen. John Cornyn or Sen. John Thune will be the next leader.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nGOP lawmakers enthused about Department of Government Efficiency\n\nRepublican lawmakers expressed support for the new Department of Goverment Efficiency, to be headed by businessmen Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n“I think it's one of the most important things that we can take on in this next administration,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. “With our federal debt approaching $36 trillion this has created the inflation crisis in America. I fully support it,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said.\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told reporters that while he supports the new department, he expects Congress will push back.\n\n“Congress always needs to do oversight, so we always need to protect our authority, right?” said Guthrie. “And so there, I assume whatever they suggest, they'll be statutory changes that we'll need to make, and then obviously, Congress will have a role…if there's anything that we feel requires change of statute, then Congress will have its role definitely.”\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublicans say they will red stamp Trump’s agenda\n\nDressed in a red Trump tie and $399 gold Trump sneakers, Rep. Troy Nehls said that if it weren’t for Trump, the GOP would have lost the House.\n\n“His mission and his goals and objectives, whatever that is, we need to embrace all of it, every single word,” Nehls said.\n\nFor leaders in the House, Nehls said that means, “if Donald Trump says, jump three feet high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch our head.”\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWill Speaker Johnson face opposition?\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said she expects Speaker Mike Johnson to face opposition for his gavel but would not say which members exactly would be the ones to challenge him.\n\n“It’s a big game of trust and there’s not a lot of trust in Washington,” Luna told reporters leaving House Republicans’ meeting with Trump Wednesday morning.\n\n“Hopefully though everyone can unify behind the president’s agenda,” she continued.\n\nLuna declined to say how she would be casting her vote for leadership.\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump arrives on the Hill\n\nTrump arrived at the Hyatt Hotel for his meeting with Congressional Republicans at 10 a.m.\n\nHis motorcade pulled into the back of the hotel.\n\nTrump is expected to meet with Joe Biden at the White House at 11 a.m.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nJack Smith to step down as special counsel investigating Trump, reports say\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, plans to step down before the president-elect takes office, the New York Times reported citing people familiar with Smith's plans. Smith and his team plan to finish their work and exit before Trump can make good his pledge to fire Smith within “two seconds” of being sworn in. CNN also reported the move, citing a Justice Department official familiar with the discussions.\n\nSmith's case involving classified documents Trump kept after leaving office was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida, but Smith's team has filed an appeal. In a case in Washington charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, Smith asked for and received a monthlong pause to the filing deadlines. The Justice Department is working to determine how to proceed in both cases, but department policy has been against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSome Republicans aren’t concerned about narrow House majority\n\nReps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY that they aren’t worried about a narrow GOP majority in the House as Trump taps GOP members for cabinet roles. Lawler acknowledged that the margin will be \"very tight\" until those moving into administration roles are replaced.\n\n“Ultimately, I think if we are focused on addressing the major issues, I would imagine there will also be Democrats voting in favor of legislation,\" Lawler said. \"It won't really be that much of an issue.\"\n\nHe added that Trump was picking “really solid members who will do a great job in the administration.”\n\nSome of Trump’s picks include Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as U.N. ambassador and Rep. Mike Walz, R-Fla., as national security advisor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is also expected to be named secretary of state, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times.\n\nStefanik and Walz's House seats will have to be filled by holding special elections, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would decide who gets the Senate seat if Rubio is chosen.\n\nRoy also said he isn’t too worried and is waiting to see what happens in the House special elections. As for Rubio’s spot, he’s optimistic.\n\n“The Senate, of course, they can do an immediate appointment, so that's not as big of a deal,” Roy said. “Absolutely, that'll be immediately filled. So as long as you fill it with a good person, which in this case, I know Governor DeSantis will pick somebody awesome for the Senate.”\n\nMelania Trump won't visit White House with Donald Trump\n\nMelania Trump is skipping the tea. A day after it became clear that Donald Trump would return as president after his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden invited the president-elect and his wife to the White House.\n\nDonald Trump accepted the invitation the same day, saying through his spokesperson that he \"looked forward to the meeting.\" Melania Trump remained silent. On Wednesday, she announced she won’t be taking tea with Jill Biden.\n\n“Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,” Melania Trump's office said in a statement on X.\n\nMelania Trump declines:White House invitation. No tea with Jill Biden\n\nTrump to meet with Speaker Johnson, other top GOP lawmakers\n\nDonald Trump on Wednesday plans to make his first visit to Capitol Hill since winning the White House for a meeting with congressional GOP leaders who will be tasked with advancing the incoming administration's agenda in 2025, according to Johnson. Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the meeting with Trump to take place Wednesday morning before the president-elect goes to the White House for an 11 a.m. sit-down with Joe Biden.\n\n\"That will be a great meeting and a moment for all of us,\" Johnson told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol. \"There's a lot of excitement, a lot of energy here. We're really grateful for President Trump leaving it all on the field to get elected.\"\n\nKristi Noem tapped to run Homeland Security\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump picked South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be his secretary of Homeland Security, selecting another loyalist to lead an agency central to his efforts to crack down on the number of immigrants who enter the country without permission. In a statement late Tuesday, Trump heralded Noem for deploying her state's National Guard to the southern border. He said that she would work closely with his newly appointed \"border czar\" to secure the United States' southern border.\n\nNoem said in a statement she was \"honored and humbled\" by the appointment, which will require Senate confirmation. \"I look forward to working with Border Czar Tom Homan to make America SAFE again,\" she said. \"With Donald Trump, we will secure the Border, and restore safety to American communities so that families will again have the opportunity to pursue The American Dream.”\n\n− Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump taps South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noemto head Homeland Security Department\n\nFox TV personality picked to run Pentagon\n\nTrump nominated Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth to lead the nation’s military as the next Defense secretary, a surprise move that elevates an unorthodox candidate to one of the most prominent positions in American government. The position requires Senate confirmation, not likely to be a problem with a GOP majority.\n\n\"With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\" Trump said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nTrump taps conservative media punditPete Hegseth as Defense Secretary\n\nMusk, Ramaswamy to lead 'efficiency' department\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday he's tapped Musk, the world's wealthiest person, and former Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new \"Department of Government Efficiency\" that will work to slash federal government spending, waste and regulations. Trump said the commission will \"provide advice and guidance from outside of government,\" partnering with the White House and Office of Management and Budget \"to drive large-scale structural reform\" throughout the federal government. He said the team's work will conclude no later than July 4, 2026.\n\nTrump taps Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamyto lead new 'Department of Government Efficiency'\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies − Essential to the 'Save America' movement,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\n− Joey Garrison, Josh Meyer, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/20/trump-administration-oz-gaetz-kennedy-terrible/76410528007/", "title": "Trump hopes you cave. With climate, Gaza at stake, we can't | Opinion", "text": "It’s been two weeks since Donald Trump won his reelection bid, and the president-elect's appointments keep coming. Each announcement feels like the punchline of a morbid joke, culminating in a lineup of people who would do the president’s bidding.\n\nBetween the incoming administration and the Republican majority in both chambers of Congress, things are looking grim.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump picked television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz for administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. He's also chosen Project 2025 contributor Brendan Carr to lead the Federal Communications Commission, not the first Trump nominee with ties to the Heritage Foundation agenda.\n\nCarr’s plans for the FEC include tackling the “censorship cartel,” the alleged anti-conservative bias of social media sites. He isn’t even the most concerning pick.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaxxer who thinks chemicals in the water could be making children gay or transgender, was nominated to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Matt Gaetz, a former Florida congressman perhaps best known for allegations of sexual misconduct, was nominated to be attorney general. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped to lead the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" a new Trump creation.\n\nAs someone who wants to see our country move forward, I’ve struggled to feel hopeful in the wake of the Democrats failing this election cycle. But now is not the time to lose hope or check out. We must continue to organize ahead of the 2026 midterm elections – in fact, we will need it if we want to survive another Trump presidency.\n\nHere are some of the appointments that concern me the most.\n\nTrump's pro-Israel government will care less about Palestinians\n\nFor the people concerned about U.S. involvement in Gaza, things are going to get a lot worse. Trump has already said that he wants to be a “protector” of Israel. His picks show that he has no concern for the more than 43,800 Palestinians who have died as a result of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is a Trump loyalist from New York. She went viral last year for her questioning of university leaders at a congressional hearing, when she asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews would lead to disciplinary action by the schools.\n\nTrump also chose former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who opposes a cease-fire deal and doesn’t believe in a two-state solution, to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nOpinion:Gen Z voters were the biggest disappointment of the election. Why did we fail?\n\nMy hope is that the pro-Palestinian protests on our college campuses didn’t end in the spring; I want to see young people continue to protest U.S. compliance in the massacre of Palestinians.\n\nAfter all, they continued to protest the Harris campaign up until the final days of the election. Vice President Kamala Harris lost a lot of votes because of her stance on what's happening in Gaza. I hope that a more conservative government does not scare people away from speaking up against what they believe is wrong. Because what they care about is about to get much worse.\n\nTrump's mass deportations will be reason enough to not give up\n\nIn the first Trump administration, people on the left were outraged by the family separation policy at the border and subhuman treatment of immigrants. That energy needs to continue into the next Trump presidency – especially because the person who oversaw those plans is returning.\n\nTrump has tapped Tom Homan, the former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another Project 2025 contributor, to be his “border czar.”\n\nAt the National Conservatism Conference in July, according to David Weigel of Semafor, Homan said on a panel that he'll run “the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen.”\n\nOpinion:Voters rejected the qualified candidate. Can we ever have a woman president?\n\nEarlier this week, Trump also threatened to declare a national emergency and use the military to enforce his mass deportation plans, something he talked about repeatedly on the campaign trail.\n\nThis is the America nearly 77 million of Americans voted for, and we must live with that. But for the next two years, I hope progressives refuse to stop talking about the ways Trump has and will continue to harm immigrants.\n\nWhat climate crisis? Climate change denial will escalate.\n\nFor many of us, the ongoing climate crisis is a major concern. For Trump, that concern doesn’t exist. Perhaps that’s why he selected Lee Zeldin, a former U.S. congressman from New York, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Zeldin consistently voted against environmental rights groups as a member of Congress. He vows to “restore US energy dominance” in his new role.\n\nTrump has also selected oil industry executive Chris Wright to lead the Department of Energy. Last year, Wright posted a video to LinkedIn denying the existence of climate change and stating that the United States is “not in the midst of an energy transition, either.” It’s safe to say that the Green New Deal isn’t happening soon.\n\nNonetheless, we can’t give up hope. The midterm elections are just two years away. If Democrats can address the issues in their last election campaign and continue organizing through those two years, it’s possible that we can keep the United States from total right-wing dominance.\n\nRight now everyone – but especially Generation Z, ages 12 to 27 – needs to remember that this fight for our future isn't over. If we want to see the things we care about come to fruition, we have to mobilize. We can't let the extremists win.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter:@sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/11/14/late-night-hosts-trump-cabinet-picks/76296467007/", "title": "Trump's Cabinet picks: Jimmy Kimmel, more late-night hosts react", "text": "The era of late-night jokes about the Trump administration has officially returned.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers on Wednesday had a field day with President-elect Donald Trump's latest picks for his Cabinet. Some of the incoming president's selections announced in recent days have been unexpected and controversial, including former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general (he's facing a House ethics investigation over sexual misconduct allegations).\n\nIn another surprise pick, Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his Defense secretary.\n\n\"You will not believe some of the people (Trump) wants to hire,\" Kimmel told viewers. \"We thought it would be crazy. It is so much crazier than anyone ever imagined.\"\n\nThe comedian, who previously held back tears in his monologue after Trump's election win, mocked the idea of Hegseth serving as Defense secretary.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"There's nothing more intimidating than a morning talk-show host,\" he said sarcastically. \"It's why Regis (Philbin) was so valuable to JFK during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\"\n\nKimmel also joked that former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard becoming Trump's director of national intelligence \"could interfere with her other job working for Russian national intelligence.\" But these \"wild\" picks seem \"reasonable\" compared to Trump's selection of Gaetz for attorney general, he argued.\n\n\"In a lot of jobs, being investigated for sex trafficking underage girls would hurt your chance for advancement, but in the Trump administration, you can list it on your resume under special skills.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmelfights back tears discussing Trump's election win: 'It was a terrible night'\n\nStephen Colbert 'shocked' by Matt Gaetz AG pick, calls Hegseth nom 'stupefying'\n\nStephen Colbert wasn't any less dismayed about the way the second Trump administration is taking shape.\n\nDeclaring that Trump's second term is \"already way worse\" than his first before it even begins, the \"Late Show\" host was aghast by the \"horrifying\" idea of Gaetz becoming attorney general.\n\n\"During the campaign, I thought if Trump won, he would do the worst things I could imagine. Turns out, I don't have much of an imagination. There is not enough botox in the world to hide how shocked I am. There's also not enough botox in the world because Matt Gaetz used all of it.\"\n\nColbert wasn't happy with Gabbard becoming director of national intelligence, either.\n\nNoting that she was once a guest on his show, he quipped, \"When I think Tulsi Gabbard, the word 'intelligence' is not the first one that comes to mind — or the second.\"\n\nDick Van Dykesays he 'fortunately' won't be around for Trump's second presidency\n\nBut the comic said that before these nominations, he was expecting to lead with the \"outrageous\" and \"stupefying\" news that Hegseth was picked to be Trump's Defense secretary.\n\nIn reference to Hegseth's job as co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend, he joked, \"If we have a war on a weekday, he won't know what to do!\"\n\nSeth Meyers derides Trump's Cabinet of 'goblins and weirdos'\n\nMeanwhile, Seth Meyers panned Trump's \"Cabinet of crazy people\" in a \"Closer Look\" segment, also describing it as a group of \"goblins and weirdos.\"\n\nIn particular, Meyers dismissed Hegseth as an \"insane choice\" for Defense secretary and suggested he needed \"unearned confidence\" to say yes to the job \"with zero government experience.\"\n\nIn addition to his job on Fox, Hegseth is also a military veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMeyers also listed off a series of TV characters or personalities who he joked could be added to the administration next, including Lionel Hutz from \"The Simpsons\" as attorney general and \"Cash Cab\" host Ben Bailey as secretary of transportation.\n\nCardi B, Joe Rogan,Stephen King and more stars react to Trump election win: 'America is done'\n\nStriking a more serious tone, the \"Late Night\" host concluded, \"One thing is clear from these appointments: Trump will not feel restrained in his second term. He's hiring oligarchs and TV personalities for powerful government positions.\"\n\nAll major late-night hosts shared their initial reactions to Trump's election win last Wednesday, with Kimmel saying his kids were \"very upset\" by the results.\n\nColbert also said it was \"really hard to see a bright side,\" and Meyers told his audience, \"We're about to step over the precipice into truly uncharted territory.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/20/prosecutors-ask-to-delay-trump-hush-money-sentencing-the-excerpt/76449042007/", "title": "Prosecutors ask to delay Trump hush money sentencing | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/03/election-2024-live-updates-harris-and-trump-make-final-campaign-push/76009369007/", "title": "Election 2024 live updates: Harris and Trump battle in swing states", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Sunday, Nov. 3.

You watch. It’s going to be so good.

Other supporters of Harris soon held similar calls.\n\nShe asked them to mobilize their Facebook Groups and family group chats to vote for her.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump in Georgia: `Kamala broke it and I will fix it'\n\nAt a Sunday night rally in Macon, Georgia, former President Donal Trump said the election is a choice between “four more years in gross incompetence and failure” and the “four greatest years in the history of our country.”\n\n“This is really all you need to know,” Trump said. “Kamala broke it, and I will fix it.”\n\nIn 2020, Trump narrowly lost Georgia, one of seven states expected to decide this year’s presidential election.\n\nTrump said the race is “on the 5-yard line, maybe even the 1-yard line.”\n\n“We’re going to close this thing out,” he said, “and it’s going to be party time.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nHarris to Gen Z in Michigan: 'I see your power'\n\nDuring a rally at Michigan State University, Vice President Kamala Harris told young voters that she recognizes the power they hold.\n\nYoung voters are leading the charge to shield the environment from the effects of climate change and protect America’s schools from active shooters, she said, bringing up the Supreme Court’s rollback of reproductive rights.\n\n“None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all, this is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I am so proud of you,” she said to loud cheers.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris begins Michigan State rally with an appeal to Arab Americans\n\nVice President Kamala Harris started her final Michigan rally with an appeal to the state’s large Arab American population.\n\nAt the start of her remarks at a Sunday evening rally in East Lansing, Michigan, Harris acknowledged the presence of leaders of the Arab American community, which has “deep and proud roots” in the state.\n\n“And I want to say, this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating,” Harris said. “And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.”\n\nShe was stopped mid-sentence by loud cheering. Continuing, she said she’d work to “bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination.”\n\nThe Biden administration is still working on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border, she said, to “protect civilians and provide lasting stability.\n\n“And as president, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people,” she pledged, before delivering her regular stump speech.\n\nHarris has been interrupted at her rallies over the past several weeks in Michigan and elsewhere by pro-Palestinian protesters who are unhappy about the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. She stressed her support from Arab American leaders earlier on Sunday after she was asked about her closing message to the community.\n\nTrump met with Arab American supporters of his campaign on Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, which has a high concentration of Lebanese Americans.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris rally in Georgia a family affair with Doug Emhoff and Maya Harris\n\nA Harris rally in Atlanta on Sunday was a family affair featuring the vice president’s sister, Maya Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nEmhoff, sporting a black Harris-Walz cap, said he was proud to see his wife address tens of thousands of people at the Eclipse in Washington, D.C.\n\n“My wife is such a badass,’’ he told a packed ballroom. “We saw a president on that stage. We saw a leader.’’\n\nEvery speaker that took the microphone Sunday, including Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat from Georgia, urged the crowd to vote and take others to the polls on Election Day.\n\n“Georgia you can decide this election,” Maya Harris told the crowd, praising people across the country canvassing for the campaign.\n\nGeorgians need to continue showing up in record numbers “so you leave no doubt where you stand,” she said.\n\nEmhoff said it’s the first campaign rally he and Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, have done together. Walz said that unlike Trump, Harris would not go into the White House with an enemy list but with a to-do list.\n\nGeorgia, Walz said, could help Harris win. “Momentum is on our side, but we’re not taking anything for granted,\" he said.\n\n“If we win by one vote it will be Jimmy Carter’s vote,’’ he said to rousing applause.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nKevin McCarthy calls on Donald Trump to campaign with Nikki Haley\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told USA TODAY Sunday that he believes Donald Trump has the “advantage” in the presidential race as it nears its conclusion, but said the former president could be doing more to close the deal.\n\n“You could’ve been more uniting, you know, if you put the Nikki Haleys, others, in there,” said the former congressman from California. “You’re running a general election, not a primary.”\n\nTrump’s former United Nations Ambassador, Haley ran against the former president in the GOP primary and drew support from moderate Republicans, a group Kamala Harris has courted with endorsements from Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney. Haley endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, but hasn’t been on the campaign trail with him.\n\n“To me, it’s all about addition not subtraction,” McCarthy said. “So where am I weak? I bring Nikki Haley in.”\n\nYet McCarthy also believes Trump has “reached out” beyond his base by incorporating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat, into his campaign.\n\nKennedy, who Trump has promised to give a big role on health issues in a future administration, has been campaigning heavily for the former president in the closing stretch. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine advocate whose public comments on health care have drawn widespread backlash.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris stops by chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit\n\nAfter attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.\n\nThe crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.\n\nSpotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nNo word on what the vice president picked up for lunch.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nOprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga to appear at Harris’ final campaign rally Monday night\n\nOprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.\n\nWinfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.\n\nHarris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry, and Andra Day are slated to perform. Later in Philadelphia, Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, and Adam Blackstone.\n\nThe Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nHarris addresses death toll in Israel-Hamas war\n\nWith just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAsked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.\n\n“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.\n\nHarris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nSupporters gather for Atlanta Harris-Walz rally\n\nThe line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris-Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.”\n\nRenee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia, was among the first to enter the ballroom.\n\n“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’\n\nIt was Cobbs’ second Harris-Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.\n\nCobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped-up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nHarris votes by mail-in ballot\n\nKamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.\n\nHarris, who served as a U.S. Senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.\n\n“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.\n\nHarris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.\n\n“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nRFK Jr: Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.\n\nThe American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevent at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\nWhen reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has \"received a variety of policy ideas\" but \"is focused on Tuesday’s election.\"\n\nBut in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said \"Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,\" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump says he 'shouldn't have left' White House\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.\n\nAs Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd: \"We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.\"\n\nTrump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAllan Lichtman vs. Nate Silver: Who will accurately predict the 2024 election?\n\nAs voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.\n\nLichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSilver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his \"gut\" tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance's final pitch to Arizona voters ties economic woes to illegal immigration\n\nVisiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale, Arizona, by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.\n\nVance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.\n\n“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.\n\nMore:JD Vance's final pitch to Arizona voters ties economic woes to illegal immigration\n\n− Laura Gersony\n\nHarris says election offers opportunity for 'freedom, justice and compassion'\n\nKamala Harris followed her guest appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.\n\nHarris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”\n\nAmericans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”\n\nThe country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5: “We are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”\n\n“Morning is on its way,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nElise Stefanik addresses gender gap between Kamala Harris, Donald Trump supporters\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.\n\nFor example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris' 17-point advantage among women.\n\nStefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”\n\nShe also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better off under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, child care was affordable,” Stefanik said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.\n\n– Cy Neff\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward news media\n\nTalking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n\"I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?\" Trump said to laughs from the crowd.\n\n“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump criticizes polls after surprising Iowa survey\n\nThe former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.\n\n\"The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,\" Donald Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.\n\nTrump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.\n\n\"We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,\" Trump said. \"And fake polls.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump says elections should be 'one day' and on 'paper ballots'\n\nAt a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, on Sunday morning, former President Donald Trump repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”\n\n“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.\n\nA judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from getting their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.\n\nIn Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump campaign adviser dismisses Iowa poll as 'outlier'\n\nTop Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.\n\nTrump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa, pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.\n\nIt’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning female voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\n'It doesn't make you a man': John Fetterman hits Donald Trump comments on transgender right\n\nSen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans' rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”\n\nFetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.\n\n“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDoug Burgum addresses Iowa poll showing Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.\n\nA Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nIn an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.\n\n“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”\n\nThe Republican governor remained optimistic about his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: \"It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Des Moines Register Iowa poll\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.\n\n\"No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. \"In fact, it’s not even close!\"\n\nEven so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nA loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigned in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nHarrison Ford, aka Indiana Jones, endorses Kamala Harris\n\nIndiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.\n\nActor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIn the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”\n\nFord concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorgia Sen. Raphael Warnock pressed on Joe Biden's 'garbage' comment\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock made an appearance Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage.\"\n\nThe president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.\n\n\"As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,\" Warnock said, adding that he believes \"That's what Kamala Harris is doing.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCould Iowa be shifting back to a presidential swing state? What new poll shows\n\nCould red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?\n\nThe new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.\n\nYet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\n– Des Moines Register staff\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nIt's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFCC commissioner criticizes Harris' 'SNL' appearance\n\nBrendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broken the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.\n\nCarr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a \"clear and blatant effort to evade\" the commission's rules unless NBC offered former President Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.\n\n“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nCarr, appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.\n\n– Karissa Waddick", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/21/trump-cabinet-nominee-sexual-misconduct-allegations/76406952007/", "title": "Some Trump cabinet picks show we're in a new era of American ...", "text": "(This story has been updated to reflect that former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his bid for attorney general.)\n\nWASHINGTON − There was a time in American politics when allegations of sexual misconduct would end a political career.\n\nBut accusations of sexual misdeeds are not a roadblock to landing a high-powered job in Donald Trump's new administration.\n\nA woman who worked as a live-in nanny for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , has accused him of groping her when she was 23. Kennedy, a member of one of America’s most storied political dynasties, said he had no memory of the alleged assault but apologized to the woman “for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable.”\n\nKennedy’s accuser, Eliza Cooney, said his apology wasn’t really an apology at all. “I don’t know if it’s an apology if you say, ‘I don’t remember,’” she said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:Exclusive: Former babysitter to RFK Jr.'s kids speaks about sexual assault allegation\n\nThree other men who Trump has nominated for prominent positions in his incoming administration also have faced sexual misconduct accusations, raising questions about their past and complicating their pathway to government service.\n\nPete Hegseth, Trump’s choice for defense secretary, paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of sexual assault, his attorney acknowledged this week. Hegseth denied the allegation and was never charged. His attorney said the Army National Guard veteran paid the woman because he feared losing his job as a commentator on Fox News.\n\nMatt Gaetz, a former Florida congressman who Trump has tapped as attorney general, has been under investigation for three years by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who denies the allegations, resigned from his House seat shortly after Trump nominated him to become the nation’s top law-enforcement officer – just days before the Ethics Committee was to release its investigative report. On Thursday, he withdrew his nomination, saying it had become a distraction for Trump's transition team.\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man who Trump has asked to help spearhead a new initiative on government efficiency, was sued in June by eight former employees of his aerospace company, SpaceX, a major federal contractor. The suit alleges that Musk and his company treated women “as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size” and described an “Animal House” workplace environment in which lewd sexual banter was common and those who complained were told to look for a job elsewhere.\n\nBy giving jobs in his incoming administration to other men accused of sexual misconduct, Trump is “kind of putting up his middle finger to everyone who has talked about his own behavior with women,” said Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University and author of the book, \"The Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\"\n\nTrump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump himself is no stranger to allegations of sexual impropriety. Nineteen women have accused him of sexual misconduct going back as far as the 1970s. Last year, a federal jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of author E. Jean Carroll, who said Trump sexually assaulted her in a New York department store nearly three decades ago. Trump denied the allegations, but the jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages. He has appealed the award.\n\nThe verdict was a rare rebuke of Trump, who has managed to confound his accusers at almost every turn. Trump's appeals against the Carroll verdicts are ongoing and it's unclear if and how his presidential election might affect them.\n\nIn 2016, Trump successfully used his career as a New York businessman and reality TV star as a springboard to the presidency, even with the sexual misconduct allegations hanging over him. Just weeks before the election, an Access Hollywood videotape surfaced in which he made of boast about grabbing women by their genitals. He won anyway, defeating the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in a stunning upset.\n\nTrump’s decision to put four men accused of sexual misconduct in prominent government positions is \"just the president-elect saying one more time he will do what he wants to do,” Zelizer said. “He doesn’t care about convention. He doesn’t care about perceptions and norms. This is him asserting himself, as he does all the time.”\n\nMore:Who has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far? Dr. Mehmet Oz among latest picks\n\nA national conversation about sexual harassment and abuse\n\nTrump is not the first public figure to face public accusations of sexual misconduct and survive. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas won Senate confirmation in 1991 despite allegations by one of his advisers, attorney Anita Hill, that he had sexually harassed her. Thomas’ confirmation hearing triggered a national conversation about harassment of women in the workplace and served as a precursor to the “#MeToo” movement that would focus even more attention on the issue.\n\nTwenty-seven years after Thomas’ hearing mesmerized the nation, one of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, would be confronted during his confirmation hearing with allegations that he had sexually assaulted a woman in the early 1980s. Like Thomas, Kavanaugh denied the allegations and won Senate confirmation.\n\nOther prominent figures in entertainment and politics have lost their jobs or were forced to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct. The fallen include governors (New York’s Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey’s Jim McGreevey), senators (Bob Packwood of Oregon, Larry Craig of Idaho and Al Franken of Minnesota) and congressmen (Anthony Weiner of New York, Mark Foley of Florida and Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina).\n\nEven the mere suggestion of sexual mischief was once enough to subject a politician to public ridicule. Devout Christian Jimmy Carter confessed to Playboy magazine during his 1976 presidential campaign that he had lusted in his heart after women who were not his wife. A political cartoonist responded with a drawing showing Carter lasciviously leering at the Statue of Liberty. Carter said the fallout nearly cost him the election.\n\nThe allegations against Trump’s four nominees are far more serious than unrequited lust.\n\nEver since Trump announced that he had picked Gaetz to serve as his attorney general, new details have emerged daily about allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use against the former congressman.\n\nFlorida Attorney Joel Leppard told ABC News he represents two women who testified to the House Ethics Committee that Gaetz paid them for sex through Venmo. One witness said she saw Gaetz having sex with her then 17-year-old friend at an Orlando house party in July 2017.\n\nCourt documents in a spin-off defamation lawsuit reference sealed testimony that refers to Gaetz at the same party where there was “alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, also known as molly, and marijuana.” Those documents could also become public after they were reportedly snatched by a hacker.\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the allegations against Gaetz but declined to bring any charges against him, which Gaetz says shows they are false. But the Ethics Committee report or damaging witness testimony that could be leaked had the potential to derail Gaetz’s nomination.\n\n“Paying for sex is concerning, providing drugs to a minor is problematic and having sex with a minor is disqualifying for a potential attorney general of the United States,” a source close to the House Ethics and a separate Department of Justice investigation said. “We don’t think of our attorney general as participating in those kinds of activities.”\n\nMore:House Ethics Committee doesn't agree to release highly anticipated Matt Gaetz report after investigation\n\nIn the case of the allegations against Hegseth, city officials in Monterey, California, confirmed last week that Trump’s nominee to lead the nation’s fighting forces was involved in an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017.\n\nA woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by Hegseth told police she remembered him preventing her from leaving a room at the Hyatt Hotel and that he was on top of her, according to newly released documents obtained late Wednesday by USA TODAY.\n\nThe woman recounted her hazy memories of the encounter but told police she said “no” a lot and that Hegseth swiped away her phone and blocked the door with his body, according to the documents from the Monterey Police Department. The 30-year-old woman, identified only as Jane Doe, told police she had been drinking Champagne and believed someone may have slipped something into her drink.\n\nNo charges were filed against Hegseth. His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the police investigation showed that Hegseth’s accuser was the aggressor but that he paid her an undisclosed sum as part of a settlement agreement after she threatened litigation in 2020.\n\nAs for Musk, the lawsuit filed by the former SpaceX employees carried a 31-page attachment that included dozens of pages of the billionaire businessman’s posts on the social media platform X, which he also owns. The lawsuit, a copy of which was reviewed by USA TODAY, said the posts inappropriately targeted groups of people and individuals.\n\nIn one post, for example, Musk announced his idea to create a Texas university similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) but noted his institution would be called “TITS” and that “Ds (women’s bra size) would get degrees,” the lawsuit said. Another post was accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis. Other posts included sexual innuendo, references to male genitals and comments about transgender people’s use of pronouns.\n\nAt least four other private lawsuits have been brought against SpaceX in California alleging sexual harassment or discrimination. In one case, filed in March, a woman alleged that her supervisor (not Musk) began a forced sexual relationship with her in 2019 that resulted in a child. The suit said SpaceX attempted to help the former supervisor avoid paying child support even after leaving the company in 2022.\n\nThe news website Business Insider reported that same year that it had documents relating to accusations that Musk propositioned a massage therapist for sex and exposed himself to her. Musk denied the allegations, telling the publication, “If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.”\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment.\n\n'My favorite president':Donald Trump and the art of rekindling world leader bromances\n\n'An inflection point'\n\nCooney, the former babysitter who said Kennedy groped her, said she feels a sense of responsibility to share her story so people can make whatever decision they want to make about the nominee. She's not trying to derail his nomination, she said. She just wants to give women courage to share their own experiences with other men.\n\n“I know that there are hardworking people who don’t have skeletons in their closet,” she said. “And I wish we were electing people with fewer skeletons in their closet.”\n\nJuliet Williams, professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the allegations against the four accused nominees should disqualify them from serving in Trump’s administration.\n\n“This tells us that a prime target in the Trump culture war is going to be people who stand up against sexual abuse and sexual violence,” she said. “And, to me, that is disgraceful that any major political party, let alone the president of the United States, would make that the centerpiece of his agenda.”\n\nWilliams and Lorraine Bayard de Volo, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, see Trump’s willingness to nominate men accused of sexual misconduct as part of a larger backlash against the “#MeToo” movement. \"#MeToo\" gained widespread attention in 2017 and caused many powerful men to lose their jobs and, in some cases, go to jail. Critics argue the movement went too far and sullied the reputations of men for sexual overtures that don’t amount to assault.\n\nBayard de Volo said she fears Trump’s nominations could discourage women from reporting sexual harassment or abuse. Already, most women who face sexual harassment or assault don’t report the abuse, she said, because they don’t trust the justice system to punish their assailants. With Trump’s nominees, “the message trickled down will be one that kind of confirms those fears,” she said.\n\nWilliams said she has been struck by how many of her students – young women in their late teens and early 20s – are shocked that a majority of Americans would elect a president with Trump’s record of sexual misconduct accusations. To them, she said, it was “like a gut punch” to realize how far away they remain from a world where women have a right to dignity, respect and safety.\n\nFor this generation of young women, “this will be, for their entire lives, an inflection point,” Williams said. “I just hope it’s not one that is deflating. I hope it’s one that’s clarifying.”\n\nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler of USA TODAY and Jim Little, Pensacola News Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/13/donald-trump-grew-closer-with-marco-rubio-after-snubbing-him-for-vp/76220668007/", "title": "Donald Trump grew closer with Marco Rubio after snubbing him for VP", "text": "The snub ultimately brought Donald Trump and Marco Rubio closer together.\n\nWhen Trump passed over Rubio to be his running mate in July, the Florida senator didn’t pull back from the 2024 campaign. Instead, he doubled down and spent even more time traveling with Trump and acting as a surrogate on television.\n\nThe men deepened a relationship that got off to a rocky start when they faced off during the 2016 presidential campaign. The relationship progressed through Trump's first White House stint and comeback bid to become a mutually beneficial alliance. Rubio provided substantive foreign policy input in Oval Office meetings, said former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton, without being overly ingratiating, as many are with the incoming president.\n\nThey worked amicably on shared policy goals during the first Trump administration, but grew closer as the 2024 campaign came to a close. They spent more time together, joking, bantering about sports and political gossip and developing more of a personal connection that went beyond their political careers, according to a close ally of both men.\n\n“They never really got to know one another really, really that well, and the odd part is after VP they did,” the source said, adding that they connected while traveling.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump tapped Rubio to be his pick for secretary of state this week, putting him fourth in line to the presidency. It caps an eight-year overhaul of their relationship, which famously bottomed out during the 2016 primary with Trump mocking the senator as “Little Marco” and Rubio firing back that Trump has “small hands” and implying another part of his anatomy is small.\n\nThey've come a long way from that nasty primary contest, cementing a personal rapport in the closing months of the 2024 campaign, when Rubio was stumping with the incoming president through his final day of rallies. They bonded despite very different backgrounds, observers say.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and a maid, Rubio had a modest upbringing in West Miami and has been in politics nearly his entire adult life, first on the West Miami City Commission, then the Florida House and eventually the U.S. Senate. Trump, meanwhile, is a business tycoon who entered politics late in life after years as a celebrity developer and television personality.\n\nThere are similarities in their personalities, though. Both are jocular, outgoing and prone to wisecracks.\n\n“They’re both guys, guys,” the source said. “They both like sports… they both like to joke” and when they interacted on the campaign trail it wasn’t “hey let’s just talk about immigration policy.”\n\nThe final stretch of the campaign not only showed they enjoyed each other’s company, but Rubio also proved he was a loyal Trump defender during difficult moments.\n\nDuring one of Trump’s toughest stretches in the campaign's closing days, after a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and Trump faced a wave of recrimination from Hispanic leaders, Rubio appeared at Trump’s next rally - his third in five days - in the heavily Puerto Rican community of Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nRubio spoke to the crowd in Spanish, joking to those who didn't understand that \"basically what I said is I saved a lot of money by switching to GEICO.” He said Trump has the most \"fascinating, most diverse coalition of Americans from every race, every ethnicity, every walk of life in modern American political history.\"\n\n\"It reminds us too that American... has never been a skin color, American has never been where your parents are born... American is anyone who is here, who wants to move this country forward and believes that our rights come from God, family's more important than government and this is the greatest country in the history of the world,\" Rubio said in a nod to the country's immigrant roots.\n\nAs the nation's most prominent Hispanic elected official, Rubio’s presence provided a vivid counter to the criticism Trump faced that he was anti-Hispanic.\n\nWhen \"the fire was hottest\" Rubio \"stood up and defended the campaign, defended President Trump in a way that a few others could,\" said the source close to both men.\n\nNow Rubio will be a leading figure in Trump's Cabinet and a potential heir to his MAGA movement, keeping himself in the mix despite losing the veepstakes to incoming Vice President JD Vance, who may be the best positioned to take Trump's mantle in four years but could face competition from Rubio and others. It's an incredible turnaround from 2016, one that revives Rubio's status as a top presidential contender even as some still question if he abandoned his principles.\n\nReconciling after a tough campaign\n\nMany Republicans have come around to Trump after initial skepticism.\n\nThe rift between Rubio and Trump was among the deepest, though, and most public.\n\nRubio at the time called Trump a “con artist” who couldn’t be trusted with the nuclear codes. Trump mocked Rubio relentlessly.\n\nYet after Trump knocked Rubio out of the 2016 presidential contest with a decisive primary victory in his home state of Florida, the senator immediately began working to align himself with the GOP's new figurehead.\n\n\"After a long and spirited primary, the time for fighting each other is over. It's time to come together and fight for a new direction for America,\" Rubio said in a video message at the 2016 Republican National Convention that praised Trump's approach to the military, taxes and appointing conservative judges.\n\nAfter Trump won, Rubio dined with the new president and his wife at the White House.\n\nRubio became an influential foreign policy figure during Trump's first presidency. He has been described as Trump's shadow secretary of state for Latin America, pushing tough policies against socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. He emerged as one of the biggest China critics, so much that he was sanctioned twice by Beijing.\n\nBolton, Trump's former national security adviser, was in Oval Office meetings that Rubio attended and noticed how Trump respected what Rubio had to say on the Americas.\n\n\"Rubio and Trump seemed to have a good personal relationship and Marco just made the case very calmly and persuasively,\" Bolton recalled to USA TODAY. \"I think it did have an effect on Trump.\"\n\nWhile many who worked with Trump have spoken about the president-elect's weakness for flattery, Bolton said he did not see Rubio employ that tactic in his dealings with the president.\n\n\"Marco's approach was always to argue the substance of the policy, the issue, and I thought he was very persuasive with Trump,\" said Bolton, a Trump critic since leaving the White House.\n\nMarc Short, who served as former Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff during the first Trump administration, said both the incoming president and Rubio seemed to move on from their contentious primary long ago.\n\nTrump \"always embraces converts\" and Rubio \"was somebody who was always eager to work with the administration,\" Short said.\n\n\"My sense was it was probably more utilitarian, in the sense of it being beneficial to both sides,\" Short said of the interactions between the two men during Trump's first administration.\n\nRubio still had differences with Trump, rebuking his comments about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. He voted to certify the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claimed was stolen. He supported aid to Ukraine.\n\nHe now is fully aligned with Trump's agenda, though, voting against the most recent round of Ukraine aid.\n\nRubio's evolution on Trump has left him with fans and critics at both ends of the GOP spectrum. Some MAGA diehards are still wary of his hawkish, interventionist past, while there are establishment Republicans who view him as a sellout. Yet he also bridges these worlds like few other Republican figures and has enough goodwill in the Senate to easily win confirmation, with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, calling him a \"strong choice\" on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rubio is \"the right guy\" for secretary of state and should have \"broad support across the spectrum.\"\n\nAmerica's face abroad\n\nAs Trump's secretary of state, Rubio will represent America abroad. He is uniquely suited for the role as a gifted communicator with extensive foreign policy experience in the Senate.\n\n\"He’d be a great face and a great voice for America,” Rounds said.\n\nRubio is \"very qualified\" for the top diplomat post, Bolton said, noting the Florida senator is \"very knowledgeable about international affairs around the world.\"\n\nRubio's skills as an orator marked him as a rising star early in his political career, propelling him to Florida House speaker at 35 and then U.S. senator by the time he was 39. Now 53, he has 14 years of experience in the Senate, where he sits on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees.\n\nMore:MAGA makeover for Marco Rubio as he evolves from Bush protégé to Trump loyalist\n\nSignificantly for Trump, who values people who can deliver his message on television, Rubio has been a ubiquitous presence on cable TV for years. According to the left wing group Media Matters for America, Rubio has appeared on conservative cable channel Fox News' weekday programing 263 times since August 2017, including 70 times since January 2023.\n\n\"I think it's been clear over the years, the president likes someone who can get on TV and speak in a way that resonates with Americans and shows the ability, shows the strength of America,\" said the source close to both men.\n\n\"Marco's got a long, very successful career in front of the camera, and I think that's that's one of the things the president saw and appreciates in him,\" the person added.\n\nRubio's new status as the chief advocate of Trump's foreign policy abroad has eased concerns among some traditional conservatives about how the next administration could play out.\n\nShort called him a \"terrific pick.\"\n\n\"I think there’s a lot of encouragement for conservatives with that pick,\" he said.\n\nRubio's evolution on Ukraine to match Trump's position against more aid has draw criticism from both the right and left. Short and Bolton support helping Ukraine in the country's fight against Russia.\n\n\"The only area I'd be concerned about is Ukraine, where he has voiced opinions closer to Trump,\" Bolton said. \"But, again, Trump is the problem on Ukraine, not Rubio.\"\n\nRiley Beggin contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}]}

In the past that was interpreted to mean a nuclear attack or, say, a conventional offensive that threatened Moscow.\n\nPutin, however, seems to have lowered the threshold to cover any loss of territory, and to have put parts of Ukraine under this nuclear umbrella. His army appears unable, though, to hold this territory against the Ukrainians, and its chaotic attempts at mass mobilisation seem unlikely to change that.\n\nIf Putin feels that his invasion of Ukraine is likely to fail entirely, and that as a result his regime’s survival is threatened, he may be more likely to reach for extreme solutions.\n\nWhat kind of nuclear attack are we talking about?\n\nMilitary planners have discussed several scenarios, ranging from a mere “demonstration strike” over the Black Sea or against a largely symbolic target there such as Snake Island, to a “decapitation strike” against Ukraine’s leadership in Kyiv; from a limited nuclear assault on Ukrainian military targets to the worst-case scenario – the destruction of a Ukrainian city, designed to cause mass civilian casualties and bring about a swift surrender, as at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHowever, most Western analysts think that the most likely is the use of “tactical”, or battlefield, nuclear weapons, which have a much smaller explosive yield than the city-flattening warheads used in “strategic” weapons.\n\nRussia has more of these than any other nation and on 1 October, the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key Putin ally, called for the use of “low-yield nuclear weapons” in Ukraine.\n\nHow effective would that be?\n\nThe idea is that tactical nuclear weapons would stop the Ukrainian advance, and signal the Russian leadership’s resolve, so as to scare Kyiv and the international community into acceding to Putin’s land-grab.\n\nHowever, it is questionable whether any of that would work. In practical terms, the Ukrainians present few targets: their troops and tanks are highly dispersed. “Putin would likely need to use multiple tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve his desired operational effect,” reports the Institute for the Study of War, a respected think tank. And that would need to outweigh the “potentially very high costs of possible Nato retaliation”.\n\nWhat sort of retaliation is likely?\n\nThe US hasn’t publicly specified, but Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, spoke on 25 September of “catastrophic consequences” for Russia, and made it clear that the White House has spelled them out to the Kremlin.\n\nA retaliatory nuclear strike isn’t likely, but the US has plenty of other options, including vast, crippling cyberattacks. The former CIA director General David Petraeus said that the US and its allies could take out every Russian conventional force that they can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine, and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea. It could also enforce a no-fly zone over the country.\n\nThe likely result would be terminal damage to Russia’s war effort. The Ukrainians have been clear, too, about their response: they would carry on fighting.\n\nBut how would Russia respond to the retaliation?\n\nThis is the truly terrifying part. If Putin were prepared to use nuclear weapons against a Ukrainian advance, then presumably he might also do so against a Nato assault. So there’s a clear possibility that the Third World War could result.\n\nIn 2017, Princeton University’s Program on Science & Global Security ran a simulation, which found that a limited tactical nuclear exchange between Russia and Nato would escalate to the point where Russia and Nato would target the 30 biggest cities of the other side, using five to ten nuclear warheads per city. It posited that more than 90 million people would die within the first few hours.\n\nIn 2019, the US Defence Threat Reduction Agency ran war games on how the US should respond if Russia were to invade Ukraine and use a nuclear weapon. The results are classified, but one participant reported: “There were no happy outcomes.”\n\nHow likely is any of this?\n\nAt present, we seem to be some distance from the brink. If the Russian military were to take a tactical weapon out of storage, US intelligence would likely spot it, and global publicity and intense diplomatic activity would follow. Russia’s last major allies, China and India, would be deeply opposed to nuclear war. Putin would also have to convince the Russian General Staff to execute his order, which isn’t a given.\n\nOverall, the US and its allies are doing everything they can to convince Putin of the sky-high potential costs and the limited potential benefits. Going nuclear would seem, the military historian Lawrence Freedman put it, “a very odd thing to do”.\n\nOn the other hand, as Fiona Hill, a leading Russia expert, recently mused: “Every time you think, ‘No, he wouldn’t, would he?’, the answer seems to be: ‘Well, yes, he would.’”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Peter Weber", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Rebekah Evans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/us-russia-nuclear-weapon-intelligence/index.html", "title": "US officials divided over new intelligence suggesting Russian ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRussian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it.\n\nThe assessment, drafted by the National Intelligence Council, is not a high confidence product and is not raw intelligence but rather analysis, multiple people who have read it told CNN. For that reason, some officials believe the conversations reflected in the document may have been taken out of context, and do not necessarily indicate that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe US has still not seen any signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to take the drastic step of using one, officials said, and Putin is not believed to have been involved in the discussions described in the NIC product.\n\nBut others within the administration who have viewed the document have reacted with concern, because it provides a rare window into conversations between senior Russian generals and reveals their intensifying frustration about Russia’s losses on the battlefield in Ukraine. That frustration could turn into desperation, some officials fear. There are also questions about whether Russia’s self-declared annexation of eastern Ukraine earlier this year means Russia is willing to take more extreme measures to protect that territory.\n\nThe US has also been watching Russia’s actions around the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces are trying to take back from Russian forces in a counteroffensive. In recent weeks, Russian officials have ordered the city to be evacuated, and the US is concerned that if Ukraine drives the Russians out in a humiliating defeat, it could be the kind of trigger that would lead Putin to resort to tactical nukes. It’s among the scenarios envisioned by the intelligence assessment, although officials emphasized that Kherson is not the sole focus of the product.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on the intelligence assessment. But the internal divisions over the quality of the intelligence and how to interpret it has not been previously reported.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are sometimes described as “small nukes,” because they are typically smaller nuclear warheads that are intended for use in a limited strike on a battlefield. They have explosive yields of 10 to 100 kilotons of dynamite, whereas “strategic” nuclear weapons have explosive yields of 500 to 800 kilotons and are designed to destroy entire cities. But tactical nuclear weapons can still be unimaginably deadly: the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945 were the equivalent of about 15 to 21 kilotons, respectively.\n\nCNN has previously reported that US officials believe that the likelihood Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine is perhaps the highest it has been since Russia invaded in February – but is still not probable.\n\nAny use of nuclear weapons would generate international outrage and would put pressure on the US and NATO to take retaliatory action.\n\n“I don’t have any comment on the particulars of this reporting,” National Security Council official John Kirby said in a statement. “We’ve been clear from the outset that Russia’s comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and we take them seriously. We continue to monitor this as best we can, and we see no indications that Russia is making preparations for such use.”\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday wrote in a statement on its website that its nuclear doctrine will only permit the use of atomic weapons in a way that is defensive in nature and that the strict guidelines “pursue solely defensive goals.” It added that Russia would only “hypothetically resort to nuclear weapons exclusively in response to an aggression involving the use of weapons of mass destruction or an aggression with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.”\n\nThe assessment is not a raw intelligence product and the sourcing for it is not robust, sources told CNN. But the internal jockeying over how to interpret the assessment reflects the broader difficulty the US has had in confidently determining whether Putin would actually go as far as using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Only Putin can know what is in his own head, officials have emphasized.\n\nConcerns escalated after Putin warned in a speech in September that “In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff.”\n\nAnd last week, Russian officials began alleging that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb“– an allegation the US worried was simply a pretext for Russia to use one itself.\n\n“The reason this particular allegation gives us some concern is because Russia has a track record of projecting, which is to say, accusing others of doing something that they themselves have done or are thinking about doing,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a Bloomberg event last week. Blinken noted that the US had “communicated directly and very clearly to the Russians, President Putin about the consequences” if he does use a nuclear weapon.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Katie Bo Lillis Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Zachary Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961332/active-nonalignment-the-global-souths-new-foreign-policy-in-face-of-ukraine", "title": "Active nonalignment: the Global South's new foreign policy in face of ...", "text": "Boston University’s Jorge Heine explains why the Global South is seeking to maintain good relations with both the United States and China.\n\nWhat does the Ukraine war have to do with Brazil? On the face of it, perhaps not much.\n\nYet, in his first six months in office, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – now in his third nonconsecutive term – has expended much effort trying to bring peace to the conflict in Eastern Europe. This has included conversations with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington, Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and in a teleconference call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It has also seen “shuttle diplomacy” by Lula’s chief foreign policy adviser – and former foreign minister – Celso Amorim, who has visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and welcomed his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Brasília.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

In so doing, Brazil is engaging in what my colleagues Carlos Fortin and Carlos Ominami and I have called “active nonalignment.” By this we mean a foreign policy approach in which countries from the Global South – Africa, Asia and Latin America – refuse to take sides in conflicts between the great powers and focus strictly on their own interests. It is an approach that The Economist has characterized as “how to survive a superpower split.”\n\nThe difference between this new “nonalignment” and a similar approach adopted by nations in decades past is that it is happening in an era in which developing nations are in a much stronger position than they once were, with rising powers emerging among them. For example, the gross domestic product in regard to purchasing power of the five BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – has overtaken that of the G7 group of advanced economic nations. This growing economic power gives active nonaligned nations more international clout, allowing them to forge new initiatives and diplomatic coalition-building in a manner that would have been unthinkable before. Would, for example, João Goulart, who served as Brazil’s president from 1961 to 1964, have attempted to mediate in the Vietnam War, in the same way that Lula is doing with Ukraine? I believe to ask the question is to answer it.\n\nNeither neutral nor disinterested\n\nThe growth of active nonalignment has been fueled by the increased competition and what I see as a budding second Cold War between the United States and China. For many countries in the Global South, maintaining good relations with both Washington and Beijing has been crucial for economic development, as well as trade and investment flows.\n\nIt is simply not in their interest to take sides in this growing conflict. At the same time, active nonalignment is not to be confused with neutrality – a legal position under international law that entails certain duties and obligations. Being neutral means not taking a stance, which is not the case in active nonalignment.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNor is active nonalignment about remaining equidistant, politically, from the great powers. On some issues – say, on democracy and human rights – it is perfectly possible for an active nonaligned policy to take a position closer to the United States. While on others – say, international trade – the country may side more with China.\n\nThis form of nonalignment requires a highly fine-tuned diplomacy, one that examines each issue on its merits and makes choices steeped in statecraft.\n\nOpting out across the world\n\nAs far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, it means not supporting either Russia or Nato. And Brazil isn’t the only country in the Global South taking that position, although it was the first to attempt to broker a peace agreement.\n\nAcross Africa, Asia and Latin America, several key countries have refused to side with Nato. Most prominent among them has been India, which despite its closer ties with the United States in recent years and its joining the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – or the “Quad,” a group sometimes described as an “Asian Nato” – with the U.S., Japan and Australia, refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has significantly increased its imports of Russian oil.\n\nIndia’s nonalignment will presumably be on the agenda during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s talks with Biden in his upcoming visit to Washington.\n\nIndeed, the position of India, the world’s largest democracy, shows how the war in Ukraine, far from reflecting that the main geopolitical cleavage in the world today is between democracy and autocracy, as Biden has argued, reveals that the real divide is between the Global North and the Global South.\n\nSome of the most populous democracies in the world in addition to India – countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina – have refused to side with Nato. Almost no country in Africa, Asia and Latin America has supported the diplomatic and economic sanctions against Russia.\n\nAlthough many of these nations have voted to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the United Nations General Assembly, where 140-plus member states have repeatedly done so, none wants to make what they consider to be a European war into a global one.\n\nHow the ‘great powers’ are reacting\n\nWashington has seemingly been caught by surprise by this reaction, having portrayed the war in Ukraine as a choice between good and evil – one where the future of the “rules-based international order” is at stake. Similarly, during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles referred to nonalignment as “immoral.”\n\nRussia has seen the new nonaligned movement as an opening to bolster its own position, with Foreign Minister Lavrov crisscrossing Africa, Asia and Latin America to buttress Moscow’s opposition to sanctions. China, in turn, has ramped up its campaign to enhance the international role of the yuan, arguing that the weaponization of the U.S. dollar against Russia only confirms the dangers of relying on it as the main world currency.\n\nBut I would argue that active nonalignment depends as much on regional multilateralism and cooperation as it does on these high-profile meetings. A recent South American diplomatic summit in Brasília called by Lula – the first such meeting held in 10 years – reflects Brazil’s awareness of the need to work with neighbors to deploy its international initiatives.\n\nThink local, act global\n\nThis need to act jointly is also driven by the region’s economic crisis. In 2020, Latin America was hit by its worst economic downturn in 120 years, with regional GDP falling by an average of 6.6%. The region also suffered the highest COVID-19 death rate anywhere in the world, accounting for close to 30% of global fatalities from the pandemic despite comprising just over 8% of the world’s population. In this context, to be caught in the middle of a great power battle is unappealing, and active nonalignment has resonated.\n\nBeyond the incipient U.S.-China Cold War and the war in Ukraine, the resurrection of nonalignment in its new “active” incarnation reflects a widespread disenchantment in the Global South with what has been known as the “Liberal International Order” in existence since World War II.\n\nThis order is seen as increasingly frayed and unresponsive to the needs of developing countries on issues ranging from international indebtedness and food security to migration and climate change. To many nations in the Global South, calls to uphold the “rules-based order” appear to serve only the foreign policy interests of the great powers, rather than the global public good. In such a context, it is perhaps not surprising that so many nations are actively refusing to be caught in an “us versus them” dynamic.\n\nJorge Heine, Interim Director of the Frederick S.

Read the latest developments here.\n\nFacing stronger-than-expected resistance from Ukrainians, Russia is also seeing intensified isolation from much of the rest of the world:\n\nBut Putin’s rhetoric has also intensified to include direct reference to his nation’s vast nuclear stockpile, placing the country on its highest state of alert and forcing an appraisal of the equilibrium that keeps nuclear-armed countries from destroying themselves and the world.\n\nWhat did Putin say?\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials on Sunday.\n\nRussia’s nuclear weapons are a part of its “deterrence” strategy. Russia took control of arms from other former Soviet republics, including Ukraine and Belarus, in the 1990s.\n\nNow Russia has invaded Ukraine – and Belarus, which is allied with Moscow, plans torenounce its non-nuclear status and could theoreticallyallow Russia to bring nuclear weapons back into the country.\n\nShould people be worried?\n\nPresident Joe Biden had a simple answer on Monday when asked by reporters if Americans should be concerned about the prospect of nuclear war.\n\n“No,” he said.\n\nIs this an unprecedented nuclear threat?\n\nThe threat isn’t unprecedented. I talked to Matthew Fuhrmann, who along with Todd Sechser, wrote the 2017 book, “Nuclear Weapons and Coercive Diplomacy.”\n\nThey documented 19 instances of nuclear threats and coercive language in the post-World War II era. These include Soviet leaders like Nikita Khrushchev telling the then-US ambassador in 1959, “The West seems to forget that a few Russian missiles could destroy all of Europe.”\n\nThey also include former President Richard Nixon, employing his madman theory of foreign policy, wanting the North Vietnamese to be told his aides believed, “We can’t restrain him when he’s angry – and he has his hand on the nuclear button.”\n\nWill Putin’s threats work now?\n\n“The track record for nuclear blackmail is not great,” said Fuhrmann in an email. “In many cases, attempts to bully other countries by raising the specter of nuclear war plainly failed, like in Khrushchev’s threats over Berlin. In other cases, like the crises between the US and China over Taiwan in the 1950s, a country got its way after making nuclear threats but it wasn’t clear that those threats played a decisive role.”\n\nThat said, the US is certainly not entering the war Russia has waged on Ukraine,and it is not creating a no-fly zone.\n\nPutin must realize that using nuclear weapons will bring them upon him and his people.\n\n“To threaten nukes cost him nothing. To use them, that will cost him everything,” said the former commander of US Army forces inEurope, retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, appearing on CNN on Monday.\n\nWhat is Russia’s nuclear stockpile?\n\nRussia’s total nuclear stockpile is larger than the United States’, at around 6,250 total nuclear warheads, according to the Arms Control Association. The US has more than 5,500.\n\nMost of those warheads in both countries are not deployed on missiles or at bases. According to an assessment by the Arms Control Association, in terms of deployed nuclear warheads:\n\nRussia has 1,458 warheads on 527 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and bombers.\n\nThe US has 1,389 warheads on 665 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and bombers.\n\nNo other country known or thought to have nuclear weapons – the United Kingdom, France, Israel, Pakistan, India, China and North Korea – has anywhere near those numbers of warheads.\n\nDoes Putin understand the implications of nuclear war?\n\n“You kind of get the sense that either he doesn’t care or he’s not completely in touch with reality,” said Tom Collina, policy director at the Ploughshares Fund, which pushes for the elimination of dangers posed by nuclear weapons.\n\n“You know, does he fully understand the consequences of what he’s doing or has he become one of these autocrats that’s so sort of divorced from reality,” wondered Collina in a phone call when I asked him how Putin’s rhetoric has changed over the past week.\n\nSechser says Putin may not have thought it all through. “Russia has now played most of its escalatory cards, and doesn’t have many tools left for resolving this crisis in its favor. The nuclear alert seems like more an act of frustration than a calculated tactical move,” he said in an email.\n\n“If the nuclear alert was intended to coerce the United States and Europe into tempering economic sanctions or abandoning Ukraine, it failed. If anything, it has served to further inflame world opinion against Russia,” Sechser added.\n\nThe US has nuclear weapons in Europe\n\nWhat has long irked Putin is the US has around 100 nuclear weapons stored in Europe at NATO bases in Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands. He fears the US could place nuclear weapons in NATO countries farther east, closer to Russia.\n\nThe US weapons in Europe are not thought to be armed, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, but rather stored underground. They would need to be loaded onto fighter jets for use.\n\nA new version of the START Treaty first enacted in 2011 and extended in 2021caps the US and Russia at 1,550 deployed nuclearwarheads each. There are thousands of additional warheads that could be called up.\n\nWhat is Russia’s policy on nuclear weapons?\n\nWhile during the Cold War, Russia employed a “no-first-use” policy toward nuclear weapons, a series of published policy positions on the issue have, since the 1990s, suggested the country could use nuclear weapons in a localized war or if it felt its sovereignty or national integrity were threatened.\n\nPutin endorsed a new “deterrent” strategy in June 2020 that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack on Russia that threatened its existence.\n\nIt’s notable that Russia has, in the view of the US, lied about threats posed to it by Ukraine and the West.\n\nWhat is the Biden administration saying?\n\nThe Biden administration is being very careful to support Ukraine without becoming directly involved in the military fight. And it is making very clear the US has not changed its own nuclear threat level.\n\nEverything the administration says is focused on pushing Russia to retreat without using the US military.\n\nThat’s why the US has rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s plea to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\n“What we want to do right now is reduce the rhetoric and de-escalate,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday.\n\nWhat is the US policy on using nuclear weapons?\n\nThe US also does not have a “no-first-use” policy and allows for the “sole authority” of the President to use nuclear weapons, and most presidents have said the “sole purpose” would be nuclear deterrence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump seemed to expand the universe of possible nuclear scenarios to include “significant non-nuclear strategic attacks.”\n\nYou’ve probably read about the nuclear football that is carried near the President at all times. If you haven’t, you should.\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to complete its own broad Nuclear Posture Review, traditionally done by new presidents, early this year. The review lays out an administration’s approach to nuclear weapons policy. These reviews are often largely classified. As a candidate, Biden suggested he would pursue a “sole purpose” nuclear strategy, which means the nuclear force can only be used to deter or retaliate for a nuclear attack against the US and its allies.\n\nJust before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, experts were not expecting a major departure from the policies of previous presidents.\n\nThere is no room for error\n\nCollina says that his fear is a nuclear war started by accident.\n\n“My concern is that as they increase the alert level, or the readiness level of their nuclear forces, if they are, then that makes it easier to stumble into nuclear war by mistake,” he said, pointing out that it has been 77 years since the US was the first and last country to detonate an atomic bomb. A nuclear weapon detonated during a war now would cause a reevaluation by the powers that have a stockpile.\n\n“It would be just a devastating catastrophic event on the ground for those people there, but also for the world going forward,” he said.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The fuel could help Iran power its nuclear reactors and could potentially further shorten Iran’s so-called “breakout time” to create a nuclear weapon.\n\nExperts emphasized to CNN, however, that the nuclear proliferation risk varies depending on which reactor the fuel is used for. And it is also not clear whether Russia has agreed to help – the Kremlin has long been outwardly opposed to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nBut the Iranian proposal has come amid an expanding partnership between Iran and Russia that in recent months has included Iran sending drones and other equipment to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine, and Moscow potentially advising Tehran on how to suppress a protest movement sweeping Iran, US officials said.\n\nIran has said its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it formally halted its weapons program, but US officials have stated that Iran’s uranium enrichment activities have gone far beyond the parameters of the 2015 nuclear deal and that the amount of time it would take for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon has shortened to just months.\n\nIn June US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned lawmakers that Iran’s nuclear “program is galloping forward … The longer this goes on, the more the breakout time gets down … it’s now down, by public reports, to a few months at best. And if this continues, it will get down to a matter of weeks.”\n\nThe Biden administration is watching any new areas of cooperation between Iran and Russia with concern. Any covert Russian assistance to Iran that could boost Iranian efforts to produce a nuclear weapon would also mark a significant shift in Russian policy, given Russia’s membership of the P5+1 group of countries that have been part of the negotiations to stymie Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“As we have said, the JCPOA is not on the agenda,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN, referring to the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “We have been working with partners to expose the growing ties between Iran and Russia – and hold them accountable. We will be firm in countering any cooperation that would be counter to our non-proliferation goals.”\n\nThe Iranian Mission to the UN and the Russian Foreign Ministry did not return requests for comment.\n\nUkraine alleged Iran is seeking help from Russia\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested last week that Iran was looking to Russia for help with its nuclear program in exchange for the military assistance it has given to Moscow, but the intelligence obtained by the US does not indicate the existence of an explicit quid-pro-quo, sources said.\n\nInstead, Iran’s overtures to Russia appear at least partly motivated by a belief among senior Iranian officials that a new nuclear deal either won’t be revived or, if it is, won’t last.\n\nSources briefed on the intelligence told CNN that Iran’s concerns appeared most acute over the summer, as it appeared to be closing in on a new nuclear deal with the US and other world powers known as the P5+1—a group that includes Russia. Iran’s fear was that a future administration might pull out of a deal, as the Trump administration did in 2018, so it sought a side deal with Russia that would allow it to reconstitute its nuclear program quickly if necessary.\n\nCNN has previously reported that Iran sought guarantees from the US that a future administration would not renege on the deal—a promise the US said it could not make.\n\nAsked whether the growing Iran-Russia partnership was a factor in the nuclear deal talks getting derailed, a senior administration official told CNN, “Obviously, side deals between Russia that fundamentally undermined the structure of the 2015 agreement would be a serious concern and further reduce the possibility of a return to the agreement.” The official declined to comment specifically on intelligence assessments.\n\nJames Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he does not believe Iran necessarily needs the help—but that they do have an incentive, namely to produce the fuel more quickly, cheaply, and on a shorter timeline.\n\n“They do have clear incentives to ask for help, particularly on the fuel side,” Acton said.\n\n“Three to four years ago, when US-Russia relations were bad, but not catastrophic, I would be pretty skeptical that Russia would provide Iran with help,” Acton added. “But under today’s conditions, under which US-Russia relations are extremely bad and Russian-Iranian relations are getting better, I think the equation looks quite different for Russia.”\n\nThe US withdrawal from the JCPOA also likely increased Russia’s willingness to help Iran in this respect, Acton noted – and especially now that a new deal appears out of reach.\n\nRussia played a key role throughout 2021 in the nuclear deal talks and even mediated some deals that allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency to move forward with inspections at Iranian nuclear sites, effectively keeping the negotiations on track.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, however, Russian officials appeared less invested in the deal. In June, Russia rejected a resolution proposed by the IAEA that criticized Iran for failing to cooperate with inspections of uranium traces found at some undeclared nuclear sites in the country, a critical sticking point that contributed to talks being derailed. That same month, a Russian delegation began making visits to an airfield in Iran to examine weapons-capable drones—which Russia has now purchased and used in Ukraine by the hundreds.\n\nUS officials have emphasized in recent days and weeks that nuclear deal negotiations are all but dead, at least for now. The Iranian regime’s brutal and violent crackdown on protesters and support for Russian military operations in Ukraine has made it increasingly difficult for senior Biden administration officials to envision striking a deal with Tehran that would provide it with a financial windfall in the form of sanctions relief.\n\nThe US Special Envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, said on Monday that while the United States remains committed to diplomacy to constrain Iran’s nuclear program, US officials are not going to “waste our time” on the nuclear deal “if nothing’s going to happen.”\n\nInstead, the US is now focused on areas it can be “useful,” Malley said, like supporting protesters in Iran and looking for ways to stop Iranian weapons transfers to Russia. He noted that the US still has “a preference for diplomacy” in dealing with Iran. But, he added, “we will use other tools, and in last resort, a military option if necessary, to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify the description of Iran’s nuclear program.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/joe-biden-nuclear-message-putin-cnntv-analysis/index.html", "title": "Biden sends a careful but chilling new nuclear message to Putin in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s never going to feel normal to hear a president discussing the danger of “Armageddon” – especially now, on camera.\n\nBut Joe Biden used an exclusive CNN interview on Tuesday to send another careful, yet clear and chilling message to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the disastrous consequences of using nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe first president since the 1980s to really have to game out calculations about nuclear arsenals and deterrence, Biden was asked by Jake Tapper whether he thought that Putin – who has warned he is prepared to use every option in Russia’s arsenal – might consider detonating one of the world’s most heinous weapons as an act of desperation in a losing war.\n\nBiden replied: “I don’t think he will.”\n\nBut the President, who first touched on this subject at an off-camera fundraiser in New York last week, made crystal clear he was sending a public message to Putin about the dangers of thinking that using a lower yield, tactical nuclear bomb would be an isolated event.\n\n“What I am talking about, I am talking to Putin. He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do,” Biden said, before warning of dangerous consequences of such a move.\n\n“The mistakes get made, the miscalculation could occur, no one could be sure what would happen and it could end in Armageddon,” he said, again stressing that a nuclear blast that kills thousands of people could lead to events barreling way out of control.\n\nThe danger of escalation\n\nBiden is stating the fear of some strategists who warn about a ladder of escalation that could occur if a nuclear bomb is used and triggers reprisals by the West – even though any initial US response would certainly go no further than conventional military action.\n\nHe also appears to be trying to create a narrative of deterrence around the specific situation in Ukraine. The logic of the US and Russia’s long-range strategic nuclear arsenals is that the use of them is deterred because a conflict would be suicidal for both sides. That equation does not exist in Ukraine, since the country has no nuclear arsenal and it’s hard to conclude that it represents a vital national interest that would lead Washington to respond in kind to Putin going nuclear. By stressing that even a tactical device – which could be small enough to destroy an airbase or large enough to reduce a city to ruins – could lead to something worse, Biden seems to be almost seeking to create a new chain of calculations in Putin’s mind.\n\nTwo moments in Tapper’s interview brought home the burden now borne by the man who is followed everywhere he goes by a military officer carrying the nation’s nuclear codes.\n\nFirst the CNN anchor asked the President to state the US red line for the US and NATO in Ukraine and what Washington would do if Putin bombed a nuclear plant in Ukraine or set off a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\n“It would be irresponsible for me to talk about what we would or wouldn’t do,” Biden said.\n\nThen, Tapper prodded the President over whether the Pentagon had gamed out scenarios. Biden soberly replied: “The Pentagon didn’t have to be asked.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nExpert: nuclear use in Ukraine still ‘not a probable event’\n\nMost experts and strategists estimate that there are many reasons why Putin would stop short of using a nuclear weapon – among them the possible risk of radioactive fallout crossing into Russia or the fact that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon may not actually be a sensible strategic option in the war.\n\nBut the fact he’s pushed himself into a corner, along with his obliviousness to civilian loss of life underscored again by his callous assaults on Ukrainian cities this week, suggests that a humanitarian impulse is unlikely to be part of his calculation. And Biden himself said in the interview that while he believed Putin was a “rational actor,” he had made significant miscalculations and his objectives were not rational. That leaves open the possibility of even more decisions that appear irrational to the West but may seem reasonable in Putin’s warped logic.\n\nThat is why Biden and experts who have dedicated their careers to staving off a nuclear apocalypse say the possibility that Putin may go nuclear must be taken so seriously – even if the chances remain very low and the US would likely be able to detect well ahead of time if Russia’s atomic devices were on the move.\n\n“It’s not a probable event. It’s not even likely,” said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear non-proliferation expert and former president of the Plowshares Fund, said on CNN’s “Newsroom” on Tuesday.\n\n“But this is a low probability, high consequence event. If he uses even one nuclear weapon, he’s bringing us into a whole new world. He’s causing massive damage. And he’s running the risk of escalation with exchanges from the West that could lead to further exchanges, et cetera.”\n\nCirincione explained that even if Putin’s saber rattling represented a political threat designed to scare the West, it cannot be discounted.\n\n“He has the means. He has the doctrine that allows him to use it. And he has the motive. He is losing this war. He has to do something to try to turn the tide of battle in desperation. He might turn to a nuclear weapon.”\n\nWhile some critics have faulted the President for mentioning words like “Armageddon” and comparing his rhetoric to that of Putin, the motivations of the two men are very different. At a minimum, the Russian leader is boasting about nuclear weapons to scare the world. Biden is speaking publicly to stave off the possibility of disaster.\n\nBiden doesn’t rule out meeting Putin over basketball star\n\nOne reason the war in Ukraine is so dangerous is that nearly eight months in, there remains no prospect of any genuine diplomatic process that could defuse it. Ukraine’s forces, using US and allied weapons systems, are making remarkable progress on the battlefield and are determined to repel an unprovoked invasion that has caused carnage and extensive destruction. Putin has thrown so much personal prestige and Russian blood into the war he can hardly afford any outcome he cannot spin as a win, despite his autocratic grip on Russia.\n\nBiden signaled in the Tapper interview that he saw no real rationale to meet Putin when both leaders are expected to be at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month. But he did leave one intriguing door open to the Russian leader, saying he’d sit down with Putin if he were willing to discuss the fate of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced in August to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to drugs smuggling. The US says Griner and another American, former US Marine Paul Whelan, have been wrongfully detained. Washington has offered to swap jailed Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the two Americans.\n\n“Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, ‘I want to talk about the release of Griner,’ I would meet with him, but that would depend,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also downplayed the idea that more generally there was anything to talk about.\n\n“He’s acted brutally, I think he’s committed war crimes, and so I don’t… see any rationale to meet with him now.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/defence/960005/aukus-does-pact-herald-an-indo-pacific-nato", "title": "Aukus: does pact herald an Indo-Pacific Nato? | The Week", "text": "Rishi Sunak joined his US and Australian counterparts in San Diego today to set out how their three countries intend to work together to build the next generation of Australian nuclear submarines.\n\nSky News reported that UK ministers have “high hopes” that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will announce the purchase of a British-designed fleet of subs at the summit, which represents the next stage of the Aukus agreement.\n\n“A sprawling military pact”, first announced 18 months ago, Politico said Aukus “promises to bring seismic changes to how the world’s most secretive military technologies are shared among allies, with strategic implications on how the three longtime friends can band together to stare down China in the coming decades”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The purchase of at least three US-made Virginia-class attack subs will follow in the 2030s, with joint UK-Australia nuclear-powered submarines based on the British Astute-class boats expected to come into service in the late 2040s and 2050s.\n\n“However all of the details shake out in the end, the result will be a historic sharing of ultra-sensitive technology that could bulk up the three nations’ navies in Beijing’s backyard,” said the news site.\n\nYet the multi-decade project also “involves considerable risk”, especially for Australia, admitted John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies at the ANU’s Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, in The Guardian.\n\nAlbanese “is walking a foreign policy tightrope”, said The Washington Post: “pushing ahead with an Aukus agreement that deepens his nation’s dependence on the American military for decades to come, while also trying to thaw the chilly Australia-China relationship he inherited last year. On one side sits Australia’s greatest ally; on the other, its biggest trading partner.”\n\nThe big question, asked the South China Morning Post, is whether Australia is “becoming ‘more dependent’ on the United States following the signing of the Aukus pact, or will the alliance make the country a safer place?”.\n\nThe paper published a series of surveys about the trilateral partnership that “have revealed a complex set of sentiments among Australians about the country’s current geopolitical climate, as US-China tensions grow”.\n\nRejecting claims by some critics that the agreement will only exacerbate tensions further, Blaxland argued: “If handled with discretion and with neighbours treated respectfully and briefed in as best as possible, the new arrangements can be expected to bolster security and stability in the region, not undermine them,” adding: “Weakness invites adventurism, it is said. This high-stakes and high-risk plan is about reducing the prospects of adventurism.”\n\nWith China identified as the single biggest threat to geopolitical security, perhaps more importantly Aukus is “looking like the seed of a Nato-type organisation for the Pacific”, said Ross Clark in The Spectator, “with the aim of providing a united front against possible future Chinese aggression in the region, just as Nato is against Russian aggression in Europe”.\n\nWith Japan and Australia announcing a co-operation between air forces, which will see some Japanese fighter planes based in Australia and vice versa, “it is not hard to see these two initiatives evolving into a formal ‘POTO’ – a Pacific Ocean Treaty Organisation – which might also involve other Pacific rim countries which are not aligned to China”, he said. “With Xi Jinping still believed to have his eyes on Taiwan, the rise of a counter military allegiance in the Pacific couldn’t come at a more appropriate moment.”\n\nWhat next?\n\n“For Britain, there is the danger of being dragged into conflict on the opposite side of the world,” said Clark, “but Aukus is a sign of opportunities to come as Britain seeks to forge new relationships post-Brexit.”\n\nWhile in the US, Sunak is also set to unveil the new integrated review of UK defence and foreign policy, which has been updated in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. City A.M. reported that the prime minister “will also confirm a new long-term military spending ambition of 2.5% of GDP and say the UK will ramp up defence investment with a £5bn boost over the next two years”, funding that will bolster ammunition stocks, modernise the UK’s nuclear enterprise and fund the next phase of the AUKUS programme.\n\nFollowing decades of a “declinist fashion in British foreign and security policy” dating back to the 1960s, “the UK’s involvement in the Aukus project demonstrates in no uncertain terms that it is ready to reclaim its natural role East of Suez”, said The Telegraph. “It is the first really practical and substantial manifestation of the British tilt to Asia.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Elliott Goat", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/13"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960259/uks-green-day-is-net-zero-achievable", "title": "UK's 'green day': is net zero achievable? | The Week", "text": "The government has unveiled its “Powering up Britain” plan to increase the country’s energy security and deliver net zero by 2050.\n\nThe revised strategy, dubbed a “green industrial revolution” by ministers, includes dozens of measures, from increasing UK wind, solar and nuclear energy to investing in carbon capture and storage. Energy Secretary Grant Shapps also plans to extend the scheme to offer households £5,000 towards the cost of a new heat pump, insulate 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes and stand by the proposed 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.\n\nBut critics say the announcements are made up of rehashed policies and lack new funding.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

What was billed as the government’s “green day” turned out “to be a weak and feeble groundhog day of re-announcements, reheated policy and no new investment”, said shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband.\n\nOther “campaigners and critics suggested ministers had missed the chance to pursue a more radical green industrial strategy”, added the paper.\n\nUnder Theresa May, Britain became the first major economy to enshrine a net zero target in law, promising that by 2050 the amount of emissions produced by the country would be the same or less than the emissions removed.\n\nBut net zero “finds itself taking a back seat to Rishi Sunak’s tougher-sounding promise of ‘energy security’ for the nation”, said Politico. Sources say his newly created Department for Energy Security and Net Zero seems keen to emphasise the first half of its brief and “reluctant to trumpet the second, fearing a Tory backlash”, the news site said. “Former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, a perennial thorn in the Tory party’s side, is also campaigning against net zero.”\n\nAnd the reality is that today’s announcements were “forced, in part, by the government’s previous failure to hand in its homework”, said Politico. They were published in response to a High Court ruling last July that found the government’s original flagship climate plan was not detailed enough to show how net zero would be achieved.\n\nThe Climate Action Tracker, last updated in October, found that the UK would “remain off-track to meet its climate targets” unless it addressed key “policy gaps” such as improving energy efficiency in homes, reducing demand for the most polluting goods, increasing uptake of heat pumps and ending the development of new oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhat next?\n\nFriends of the Earth, which brought the legal challenge against the government in the High Court last summer, is “poring over” the new strategy “to see if it still fails to meet legal obligations to cut carbon emissions”, said Sky News. Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer with the environmental group, told the broadcaster that sufficient plans and policies to reach net zero were a legal obligation, not “some sort of wishy-washy requirement”.\n\nThe new plan comes in the wake of the European Commission’s Green Deal Industrial Plan and Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a $370bn green investment package that vows to subsidise domestic companies investing in net zero. As these two industrial giants engage in a “transatlantic arm-wrestle over the technology, investment and skills needed for net zero, the UK has effectively said it cannot compete”, said Sky’s business correspondent Paul Kelso.\n\nWriting in The Times today, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt acknowledged that the UK’s approach would be “different”, saying: “We are not going toe-to-toe with our friends and allies in some distortive global subsidy race.”\n\nBut his fellow Tory MP and former Cop26 president Alok Sharma told The Guardian that “what we still need to see is that big bazooka moment, commensurate with the scale of the challenge”.", "authors": ["Hollie Clemence", "The Week Uk", "Irenie Forshaw", "Marc Shoffman", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/30"}]}

It also firmly places bitcoin's market cap above $120 billion.\n\nHow on Earth has bitcoin become the top-performing and most talked about investment of 2017? It really has to do with four catalysts.\n\nBitcoin's amazing 2017, in a nutshell\n\nThe first is the excitement surrounding blockchain, which is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies most virtual currencies and records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. What makes blockchain so exciting is that it's usually an open-source network, meaning altering logged data without someone else findings out would be practically impossible. Blockchain could really shore up security in the financial services industry, as well as a variety of other sectors.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. dollar has been sinking pretty steadily over the past year. Recently hitting multi-year lows against the euro, the weaker dollar has left investors holding cash looking for ways to protect their wealth. Usually, when the dollar is sinking, investors will buy gold. This is because of the scarcity of gold and the proven fact that it's a store of value (it's been used as a form of currency for centuries). But bitcoin is being considered a scarce asset as well. Protocols limit the number of mined bitcoin to 21 million, which some investors believe makes bitcoin a proper store of value.\n\nThird, there's growing excitement surrounding bitcoin as a mode of payment. Five brand-name businesses have accepted bitcoin since 2014, and a host of smaller merchants have latched on since then. As a libertarians' dream currency, some investors are simply excited about the potential for merchant expansion.\n\nAnd lastly, emotions have played a key role in pushing bitcoin higher. Even though we're beginning to see a few institutional investors getting involved – Goldman Sachs is tinkering with the idea of opening trading operations in bitcoin — retail investors primarily control bitcoin's price movements. Since retail investors are far more susceptible to emotional trading than Wall Street institutions, it's led to a rush into bitcoin, with some folks not wanting to miss the boat.\n\nMore: Bitcoin's creator may be worth $6 billion — but people still don't know who it is\n\nMore: Amazon gets three cryptocurrency domain names\n\nMore: Bitcoin jumps $400 in one day and soars to a new record high\n\nThe costly mistake bitcoin investors are making\n\nWhile it's been an undeniably great year for bitcoin investors, I'd argue that many of these investors could be making a crucial mistake. Namely, placing too much emphasis on bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nThough long-term buy-and-hold investment mogul Warren Buffett has thus far been wrong about bitcoin, he did raise an important point back in 2014. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said:\n\nStay away from it. It's a mirage basically. It's a method of transmitting money. It's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money? Just because they can transmit money? I hope bitcoin becomes a better way to do it. But you can replicate it a bunch of different ways. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.\n\nIf you were to try to live off bitcoin, there's a really good chance you'd struggle to do so. Bitcoin's volatility, lengthy settlement times, and transaction fees work against the idea of recruiting more merchants to the virtual currency. Plus, there's really no floor beneath bitcoin without government backing or any concrete fundamental drivers.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the barrier to entry in the virtual currency space is pretty low. There are now nearly 1,200 global cryptocurrencies, and big businesses have in some cases banded together to create their own virtual currencies.\n\nOh yeah, one more thing...\n\nIt's also possible that investors are misplacing their faith in bitcoin's blockchain. Back in August, bitcoin forked into two separate virtual currencies — bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash — because the bitcoin community was at odds over how best to upgrade its blockchain. Those in Bitcoin Cash chose to expand capacity within the existing blockchain. As for bitcoin, the SegWit2x upgrade took some information off the blockchain to boost capacity, reduce transaction fees, and speed up settlement times. The move was clearly made to attract big business.\n\nHowever, bitcoin's blockchain may not be the preference of enterprises. There are currently more than 150 organizations testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in pilot and small-scale trials via the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Bitcoin's biggest rival, Ethereum, also has a valuable feature known as \"smart contracts\" built into its blockchain. Smart contracts are protocols that assist with facilitating, verifying, and enforcing the negotiation of a contract. Right now, Ethereum looks to be the preferred blockchain, which is where the tangible value of cryptocurrencies really lies.\n\nIt's quite possible that bitcoin investors are buying into the wrong catalysts, which could turn out to be bad news over the long run.\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Meanwhile, Thomson Reuters data showed Goldman Sachs had a value of $93.67 billion, and Apple's market cap was at $806.65 billion.\n\nWhen bitcoin was trading at $2,600 earlier this year, Moas predicted it would hit $5,000. The digital asset was trading at about $5,700 on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the cryptocurrency with no controlling body was an \"Enron in the making.\"\n\nPreviously, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called the cryptocurrency \"an index of money laundering,\" while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted if \"you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day.\"\n\nMoas said that the three prominent critics of bitcoin were \"heavily invested\" in publicly-traded U.S. banks that are currently being threatened by the cryptocurrency. \"I don't expect those people to come out and recommend ... to buy bitcoin. Because that hurts their business,\" he said.\n\nMore:Bitcoin hits record as it surges above $6,000\n\nMore:Black Monday: Can a 1987-style stock market crash happen again?\n\nMore:Retirement investing: Is a bitcoin IRA right for you?\n\nHe said he expects the price of bitcoin to jump to $50,000, possibly within a decade and the market value could cross a trillion dollars.\n\n\"You have a supply-demand equation here that is mindboggling to me,\" Moas said. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million tokens, which is expected to be reached only in the next century.\n\nBut Bitcoin's growing popularity and acceptance among users to carry out financial transactions could mean a wider adoption in the future — and greater demand for the cryptocurrency. According to Moas, in a few years, there could be about \"200 million people around the world trying to get their hands on a few million bitcoin.\" That, he said, would drive the price to $50,000 per token.\n\nOther cryptocurrency proponents have also said in the past they expect bitcoin to hit a market value of at least $1 trillion by 2025. Regulation may help lend more credibility to the cryptocurrency among investors.\n\nMoas added that out of the 1,000 or so cryptocurrencies that are currently in existence, he is focusing only on the top 20 names that account for more than 90 percent of the total market value. A majority of the rest are \"pump-and-dump scam operations,\" he said.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The \"memecoin\" became so popular that its market value rose to $45 billion in April 2021.\n\nMusk was one of the coin's biggest supporters, so much so that in 2023 he even temporarily changed the logo on X, formerly known as Twitter, to the Doge dog logo, triggering a spike in Dogecoin value.\n\nDoge memes could return in 2025 when President-elect Donald Trump takes office after he tapped Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nInvest wisely: Best online brokers\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,\" according to a statement by Trump shared on Musk's X page on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's announcement even led to a continued increase of Dogecoin's value on Tuesday night, with the cryptocurrency having risen more than 150% since Election Day.\n\nHere is what to know about Doge (the meme), Dogecoin (the cryptocurrency), and DOGE (the newly established department).\n\nDoge, the meme\n\nThe Doge meme became popular online in the early 2010s, according to Know Your Meme. Internet users circulated zoomed-in photos of the dog's face with his eyebrows raised.\n\nKabosu, the Japanese dog famously known as the subject of the meme, was a Shiba Inu who lived to 18 years old before his death earlier this year.\n\nKabosu:Memeified dog widely known as face of Dogecoin has died, owner says\n\nDoge, the coin\n\nCreated by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin became one of the most popular \"meme stocks\" amid a boom in retail trading during the COVID-19 pandemic. GameStop, AMC and other seemingly forgotten stocks rose around the same time Dogecoin gained steam.\n\nGameStop took Wall Street by storm in January 2021 after Roaring Kitty and other small-pocket investors on Reddit contributed to a historic short squeeze that drove stock prices high. Similarly to GameStop, Dogecoin's popularity stemmed from celebrity endorsements, memes and GIFs.\n\nSnoop Dogg, Mark Cuban and many others hopped on the Dogecoin bandwagon, but none of them compared to Musk's love for the cryptocurrency. Musk was even accused of insider trading by investors in June 2023 because of the series of stunts he pulled, including changing the logo of Twitter to Doge's logo and Tesla announcing that it would accept the currency as a means of payment for the company's merchandise, the Guardian previously reported.\n\nMusk and Tesla won the dismissal of the $258 billion federal lawsuit on this past August after the court deemed he did not defraud investors by hyping up Dogecoin or conduct insider trading, according to Reuters.\n\nDOGE, the newly formed 'Department of Government Efficiency'\n\nMusk is quoted in Trump's statement saying the Department of Government Efficiency will \"send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!\"\n\nAccording to Trump, DOGE will provide advice and guidance from outside of the government, and it will partner with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to \"drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.\"\n\nAdditionally, Musk and Ramaswamy will be in charge of driving out what Trump's statement calls \"massive waste and fraud\" from government spending. The billionaires' work is expected to conclude no later than July 4, 2026, according to the president-elect.\n\nIt is unclear if DOGE will exist within the federal government or outside because an official government agency cannot be created without an act of Congress. Trump's description seemingly suggests the department would operate as an advisory commission − not a formal federal agency − with no statutory authority.\n\nContributing: Taylor Ardrey, Joey Garrison, Josh Meyer, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, David Jackson, Jessica Menton, Craig Harris, Brett Molina, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2021/04/23/bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-biden-capital-gains-tax/7347445002/", "title": "Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ether tumble on concerns over capital-gains tax", "text": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether and Dogecoin took a beating Friday, extending a recent run of wild swings as President Joe Biden is expected to unveil a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans that would nearly double levies on investment gains.\n\nThe losses erased more than $200 billion of value from the cryptocurrency market, according to CNBC, citing data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nGiven Bitcoin's meteoric rise in recent years, it could push some investors to sell their positions in an effort to secure their profits at the current capital-gains tax rate.\n\nBitcoin, the world’s most popular digital coin, slumped 10% to below $50,000, just over a week after it eclipsed $64,000 for the first time.

It was viewed as a landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe sharp rise in the value of bitcoins recently has led to worries of a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency market, some analysts warn, with bitcoin at one point more than doubling since the start of 2021.\n\nThere have also been growing concerns about a regulatory crackdown on bitcoin.

Ether, the second-biggest digital currency by market value, fell 7%.\n\nLast week, bitcoin prices topped $64,000 as Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, made its public debut on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe Coinbase listing, which was viewed as a landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry, has attracted amateur traders.\n\nThe sharp rise in the value of bitcoins recently has led to worries of a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency market, some analysts warn, with bitcoin more than doubling since the start of 2021. About 74% of those surveyed in Bank of America's latest global fund managers report said the world’s most popular digital coin is a bubble.\n\nBitcoin has been highly volatile. In late 2017, the digital token rose to nearly $20,000, before crashing to almost $3,000 the following year.\n\nDogecoin, the cryptocurrency created as a spoof, hit a record Friday. Heading into the weekend, it had soared more than 400% in the past week and skyrocketed by more than 5,000% since the start of the year, further stoking concerns about a cryptocurrency bubble.\n\nRobinhood briefly suffered a “major outage” last week in the midst of Dogecoin’s rally, angering many retail investors.\n\nOver the weekend, Dogecoin fell from its record high after topping 44 cents on Friday to hit a low of 24 cents on Saturday, though has recovered some of its losses and is currently trading around 31 cents.\n\nBitcoin had already been under pressure in recent days. It fell more than 4% Friday after Turkey’s central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies from the end of April, saying crypto payments came with “significant risks.” India is also reportedly set to propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or holding such digital assets.\n\nTo be sure, more companies have started accepting the currency as an official payment option despite concerns about volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Investment banks like Morgan Stanley have offered some of the wealthiest clients access to Bitcoin funds.\n\nIn February, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car company would accept bitcoins as a form of payment for all models of its cars in the U.S. Online payments company PayPal has also begun to accept Bitcoin as payment.\n\nThe euphoria surrounding Coinbase’s trading debut could trigger a short-term “buy the rumor, sell the event” type of reaction for investors, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange trading service OANDA, said in a note.\n\n“Buy the rumor, sell the news,” is a market adage based on the belief that an asset may rise in anticipation of rumors, then stagnate or fall when investors take profits after the news is released.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/21/craziest-bitcoin-fact-of-the-year/108739116/", "title": "The Craziest Bitcoin Fact of the Year | The Motley Fool", "text": "Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWords can't accurately describe what an amazing year it's been for cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhereas the stock market has been shown to be the greatest creator of long-term wealth, with an average annual return of 7%, inclusive of dividend reinvestment and adjusted for inflation, virtual currencies have left them in the dust this year.\n\nBitcoin has become the face of the cryptocurrency revolution\n\nPerceived to be leading that charge is the world's most popular, most tradable, and most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin (CCY: BTCUSD). Having begun the year at just below $967 per coin, bitcoin is valued at over $16,500 per coin. That's a healthy return of better than 1,600% in just 11-1/2 months. In other words, we're talking about a lifetime's worth of gains for some folks in less than a year.\n\nThe catalysts behind bitcoin's ascent are aplenty. For instance, there's a lot of buzz surrounding the use of blockchain, which is the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records all transactions without the need for a third-party, like a bank. It's believed that blockchain could have the potential to lower transaction fees since there's no middleman, improve network security since it's decentralized, and quicken transaction settlement times since transactions are being proofed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Blockchain is particularly attractive to the financial services industry.\n\nBitcoin investors are also encouraged by the uptake of virtual currencies as a validated form of payment. After snagging five brand-name merchants in 2014, bitcoin has picked up a steady stream of new retailers with each passing year. Also, Japan began accepting bitcoin as a regulated legal form of tender earlier this year, while CBOE Global Markets launched bitcoin futures trading this month, further validating bitcoin's ascent to becoming a validated asset.\n\nOn a more fundamental basis, bitcoin has also benefited from a weaker dollar and low interest rates. When the dollar drops in value, those holding cash usually seek out investment opportunities that'll help preserve the value of their cash. In the past, gold has been the primary asset they'll turn to, since it's scarce and has been used as a currency for more than 2,700 years. However, bitcoin's protocol limit of 21 million mined coins also creates a sense that it's a scarce asset. Combined with low interest rates that are leading to minimal returns for bond and CD investors, bitcoin has looked pretty attractive.\n\nA truly crazy bitcoin fact\n\nYet there's a truth that bitcoin investors need to come to terms with in 2017: Bitcoin has actually underperformed its peers. I know that sounds crazy considering that bitcoin is up more than 1,600% year to date, but it's the truth.\n\nSince the year began, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, has increased from $17.7 billion in value to $517 billion in market cap as of Dec. 14. That's an increase of more than 2,800%. Now, if we remove bitcoin from the equation and just look at the aggregate market cap increase in all other cryptocurrencies since Dec. 31, 2016, they've grown from $2.24 billion to $238 billion – an increase of 10,500%!\n\nVirtual currencies that are currently trailing bitcoin in market value have really been the stars in 2017. Ethereum, which now sports a market cap of $66 billion, is up 8,500% through Dec. 14, while Ripple and Litecoin, which are respectively the third- and fifth-largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, are up a respective 12,600% and 6,300%.\n\nWhy has bitcoin underperformed its peers in 2017? It probably boils down to two factors.\n\nFirst, we have the rule of large numbers. With a market cap of $276 billion, it's perceived to be psychologically much harder for bitcoin to double in value from here than it would for, say, a virtual currency worth $500 million or $1 billion. This cash inflow into nascent virtual currencies is a big reason why the crypto-rally has really picked up in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe other reason bitcoin's peers have outperformed is that a lot of investors are eager to \"find the next bitcoin.\" Being the first mover does have its advantages, but in this instance investors seem to be more focused on finding the next virtual currency with payment facilitation or blockchain potential like bitcoin rather than buying bitcoin itself.\n\nIs this a bubble? Probably\n\nHowever, investors should also understand that while the cryptocurrency market hath giveth in a big way in 2017, it could just as easily taketh away next year.\n\nOne of the bigger reasons digital currencies have done so well is the lack of what I'd call a \"fair\" market. With institutional investors predominantly sticking to the sidelines, it's allowed retail investors to drive virtual currencies higher. But these investors are limited on cryptocurrency exchanges to just buy and sell orders. With traditional equities, investors have the option of short-selling or using futures to bet against an equity in order to make money (thus a \"fair\" market, where everyone can be a winner). As cryptocurrency trading becomes more mainstream, the trading options should open up, allowing skeptical investors a chance to voice their opinion, and put money behind that opinion.\n\nHistorically, we also have to take into account the fact that investors are notoriously bad at overestimating the adoption of new technology. For instance, 3D printing, human genome decoding, and internet business-to-business commerce are all successful technologies today that were hyped into a major bubble when first introduced. This leads me to believe that while blockchain technology and their tethered virtual currencies may have a role in the future, their immediate adoption by big business is unlikely.\n\nLong story short, don't expect the chatter that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in a bubble to die down in 2018. If anything, I'd expect it to accelerate.\n\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Cboe Global Markets.

Such thinking would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when the common consensus was that \"crypto winter\" would extend into much of 2023.\n\nBut are any cryptos really safe to buy right now? And, if so, which ones should investors be thinking about adding to their portfolios this month?\n\nBitcoin\n\nFirst up is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is regaining its status as \"digital gold\" in the minds of many investors due to all the uncertainty in the market today. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold has been surging in recent months, and the growing consensus is that Bitcoin is probably the safest crypto to invest in right now. Of course, \"safest\" is a relative term, because we all know how risky and volatile Bitcoin can be. Last year, for example, the value of Bitcoin plummeted by nearly 65%.\n\nDollar dollar bill, y'all:Gen Z is using cash more than ever in the face of inflation\n\nBut one factor in Bitcoin's favor is its long track record, which has made it a favorite of both retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin, which was created back in 2013, has survived several different market crashes over the past decade, and has emerged stronger each time. Bitcoin continues to offer tremendous upside potential, based on the pace of its international adoption as both a form of payment and a store of value.\n\nIn fact, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has modeled the long-term growth potential of this crypto and concluded that Bitcoin could soar past the $1.48 million price mark by 2030. Less aggressive estimates have Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024. Thus, from my perspective, Bitcoin offers the optimal blend of risk and reward of any top cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\n\nNext up is Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing only Bitcoin. Ethereum offers investors a well-diversified ecosystem, with exposure to every key segment of the blockchain and crypto world. This includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming. Thus, by holding Ethereum, you are diversifying away some of the risk of holding crypto in your portfolio.\n\nMost impressively, Ethereum continues to upgrade its blockchain, ensuring that it remains the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. Last year, for example, Ethereum completed The Merge. This technological upgrade helped to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more scalable. And it prepared Ethereum for the next wave of growth in the blockchain world. And then, in March of this year, Ethereum came through again with Shapella (also known as \"Shanghai\"), another major upgrade to secure its status as a premier blockchain.\n\nAnd Ethereum shows no signs of stopping with future updates. Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, has already given investors a detailed roadmap for what's coming next in 2023 and 2024. The goal is to make Ethereum the highest-throughput, fastest, and most scalable blockchain in the world.\n\nSolana\n\nFor the third pick, I would have to go with Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), an Ethereum competitor with an $8.15 billion market cap. This is one of the few blockchain projects with the potential to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum this year. Year to date, Solana is already up 107%, which is more than Bitcoin (65%) and Ethereum (53%).\n\nWhile some might argue that this remarkable rebound in Solana is nothing more than a dead cat bounce after the FTX (CRYPTO: FTT) meltdown last year, there are several key steps that Solana has taken in 2023 that have me very optimistic about its future. One of these is the recent launch of Saga, the first-ever mobile phone by a major blockchain network. The Android-powered Saga has been described as a \"crypto phone\" due to its integration of crypto-friendly features. This mobile phone could be the key to Solana gaining a key foothold in the Web3 market, where Solana is preparing other initiatives.\n\nWhich crypto to buy first?\n\nIf there's one cryptocurrency to buy first this month, it's Bitcoin. As noted above, this is the one crypto that offers the optimal blend of risk and reward. This is an especially important consideration, given the economic headwinds swirling around the market right now. Thus far, at least, Bitcoin has proven to be a safe haven asset worth holding at a time when America's regional banks seem to be failing on a frequent basis.\n\nBut if you're really looking to outperform the market, that's when it's time to explore the altcoins that are much smaller (and hence, much riskier) than either Bitcoin or Ethereum. My personal pick is Solana, which has already skyrocketed to triple-digit gains in 2023. Solana comes with its share of drawbacks -- such as continued concerns about network stability -- but is a blockchain that I think is building a long-term future in the crypto world.\n\nDominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

That approach would shield Detroit from the risk of wild fluctuations in the value of such digital currencies, city Treasurer Nikhil Patel said in a phone interview.\n\n\"So the market volatility risk will not be (borne), whatsoever, by the city. We will settle the payment in dollars,\" Patel said. “So let’s say you get on the platform, you make a crypto payment.

(Miami in 2021 introduced its own cryptocurrency, the MiamiCoin, in a marketing push to make the Florida city a cryptocurrency capital, but the city doesn't accept the digital coin for tax payments.)\n\nPatel said the idea to embrace cryptocurrency as a way to pay Detroit taxes and fees originated with Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\n\"His conception was to send a signal to the rest of the world, frankly, that Detroit is the place where we want to invite technologists to build, to create, to develop,\" Patel said. “And from my perspective as treasurer, my goal is to make it as easy as possible and as efficient as possible for people to make payments.\"\n\nThe specific cryptocurrencies that would be accepted through the PayPal platform the city will use include bitcoin, Ethereum, Lightcoin and PayPal's U.S. dollar-backed \"stable coin,\" Patel said.\n\nBitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has surged in value since Tuesday night — Election Day — when Donald Trump emerged as the likely winner of the presidential race. The value of 1 bitcoin was at an all-time high Thursday afternoon at over $76,500. Patel said that, aside from cryptocurrencies, Detroit is considering ways to expand tax and fee payment options for residents who may not have bank accounts, with more in-person payment locations and possibly accepting other digital options such as Venmo.\n\nContact JC Reindl: 313-378-5460 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

Here's why.", "text": "Cryptocurrencies gyrated sharply Tuesday, extending a recent run of wild swings.\n\nFor the first time since January, bitcoin — the world’s most popular digital coin — briefly dropped below $30,000, a key level that technical analysts monitor. It erased its gains for 2021 before recovering to trade at $32,481.93, according to CoinGecko, a crypto market data site.\n\nBitcoin at one point shed more than 10% to trade as low as $29,154.73, losing more than half its value since hitting a record high in April. That's after a tremendous performance in 2020, with the digital currency surging more than 300%.\n\nOther cryptos joined the sell-off before paring losses, with ethereum, the second-biggest digital currency by market value, slumping more than 5%. Now it's ticked up 0.7% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also spilled over to smaller coins like Dogecoin, a meme-inspired crypto that at one point tumbled more than 25% to erase all of its gains since April. It has since cut declines and is down 1% in the past day.\n\nHere’s what drove the latest sell-off:\n\nWill Dogecoin go up or bust?:Here are 700 million reasons its bubble will burst.\n\nBitcoin is up, then down:But exactly how does it work?\n\nWhy are cryptos falling?\n\nAfter topping $64,000 in April, bitcoin has struggled to reclaim its all-time highs since then following a series of events. It came under pressure in May after tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has driven traders into frenzies by mentioning cryptos at times, said Tesla will stop using Bitcoin as a form of payment over concerns of the cryptocurrency's impact on fossil fuels.\n\nSince then, cryptos have gyrated as coins such as ethereum typically to move in tandem with bitcoin.\n\nIn early June, bitcoin fell further amid concerns of its use in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.\n\nBitcoin, for instance, briefly touched $40,000 last week and fell again Monday after China's central bank deepened a crackdown on cryptocurrencies. China's central bank said it ordered some banks and payment firms, including China Construction Bank and Alipay, to crack down further on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nBitcoin shed more than 10% on Monday, its largest one-day drop in over a month.\n\nHow much have Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin lost in value?\n\nWith Tuesday’s losses, bitcoin has slid more than 50% from its all-time high above $64,000 in mid-April. To be sure, bitcoin is still up more than 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nEthereum has shed nearly 57% from its all time high of $4,356.99 in May while Dogecoin has shed more than 70% since it touched a record of about 73 cents last month, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIs more pain to come?\n\nCryptos could be poised for further declines based on a closely watched indicator, according to technical analysts.\n\nOver the weekend, bitcoin formed a death cross, a chart pattern that signals the potential for a major sell-off. Bitcoin’s average price over the past 50 days fell below its 200-day moving average, which means there could be more pressure on the digital coin.\n\n\"Long-term bitcoin bulls are getting nervous as a break of $30,000 could see a tremendous amount of momentum selling,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange trading service OANDA, said in a recent note. \"Many traders have waited for one more push lower, which could see crypto traders wait for a plunge towards the $20,000-$25,000 area.\"\n\nElon Musk, Snoops Dogg and Mark Cuban love Dogecoin. Should you?:How to stay safe when investing in cryptocurrency\n\nSome analysts think the May sell-off in bitcoin weakened institutional demand, which is likely to keep prices under pressure in the near term.\n\n\"There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report earlier this month.\n\nStill, some are using the recent decline in bitcoin as a buying opportunity. On Monday, MicroStrategy, enterprise software company, said it scooped up an additional $489 million worth of bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 105,085 bitcoins.\n\nAre cryptos right for you?\n\nFirst-time investors should proceed with caution. Piling all of your nest egg into something as volatile as cryptocurrencies poses big risks to your retirement, experts say. Wealth managers and finance experts have long been skeptical of these speculative investments for amateur investors due to their extreme swings.\n\nIn 2013, bitcoin began trading around $13 and spiked to more than $1,000 by December. In late 2017, the digital token surged to nearly $20,000, before crashing to almost $3,000 the following year. What followed was a dizzying rise to above $64,000 in April 2021.\n\nDogecoin has seen similar booms and swoons. It has ridden a similar Reddit-driven wave as stocks like GameStop and AMC in recent months, accelerated by a series of tweets by Musk, who was pumping the cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptos are now in 401(k)s:Are they the right investment for your nest egg?\n\nEven with the latest declines, the sharp rise in the value of bitcoin earlier this year has some analysts worried about a potential bubble in the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin's price – at one point – more than doubling since the start of 2021.\n\nAbout 81% of fund managers polled in a recent Bank of America survey in June said bitcoin was still a bubble. That’s up from about 75% of managers who said so in May.\n\n“While there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will recover this time, those who believe in its long-term future may well see this decline as an opportunity to invest more,” James Royal, analyst at Bankrate.com, said in a note.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency traders, especially individuals, need to know the risks of what they own,\" Royal added. \"In some cases, the risks could be a complete loss of their investment.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2017/10/30/bitcoin-just-split-into-2-separate-currencies-again/107106486/", "title": "Bitcoin Just Split Into 2 Separate Currencies... Again | The Motley Fool", "text": "Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAs we look back on the first 10 months of 2017, one thing is very clear to investors: It's belonged to cryptocurrencies. Since the year began, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies combined has grown from $17.65 billion to $167.88 billion as of Oct. 25, 2017. Just your run-of-the-mill 851% gain in 10 months! Comparatively, the stock market has taken decades to deliver the same magnitude of returns for investors.\n\nMaking sense of the hype surrounding bitcoin\n\nLeading the charge higher has been bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, and unquestionably the largest by market cap. Bitcoin's market cap of $94.3 billion on Oct. 25 makes up 56% of the aggregate market value of nearly 1,200 cryptocurrencies.\n\nEven though bitcoin hasn't been the top-performing cryptocurrency in 2017 on a percentage basis, its catalysts are, by far, some of the clearest in the space. Some investors remain excited about the payment-platform potential of bitcoin, while others have sought its safety as a store value amid a falling U.S. dollar. Since bitcoin's protocols limit the number of coins that can be mined, to 21 million, it's perceived to be a finite asset — just like gold.\n\nBut the wildcard catalyst of the bunch is the potential for blockchain, the underlying technology of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions without the need for a bank or financial intermediary. As open-source networks, blockchain makes it veritably impossible to alter logged data without being noticed, making it a potentially safer peer-to-peer and business-to-business transaction platform of the future.\n\nBitcoin just hard forked into two virtual currencies ... again\n\nThough blockchain is probably the most tangible and fundamental reason to invest in bitcoin, it's also arguably the greatest source of confusion. This past week saw bitcoin fork (i.e., split) into two separate currencies for the second time in three months as a result of a disagreement over the future of its blockchain from within the bitcoin community.\n\nAt the beginning of August, bitcoin hard forked into two separate currencies, bitcoin and bitcoin cash, after the community couldn't come to an appropriate consensus on what should be done to improve blockchain capacity and transaction settlement times. While roughly three-quarters of those involved believed bitcoin should market its blockchain to attract big business, a quarter of folks dissented and preferred that bitcoin remain a Libertarian's dream currency. This fell short of the required 80% consensus needed to avoid a fork into two separate currencies.\n\nThe result was a fork into bitcoin cash, which chose to simply upgrade within the existing framework of the blockchain, and bitcoin, which implemented the SegWit2x upgrade that took some info off of the blockchain in order to boost capacity, while simultaneously lowering transaction fees and speeding up settlement times.\n\nThis past Tuesday, Oct. 24, bitcoin forked, once again, into two separate currencies, bitcoin and bitcoin gold, as a result of the community being unable to decide on the future of its blockchain. In this instance, the community was divided over whether something should be done about just a small handful of miners having control of the high-end machinery needed to mine bitcoin.\n\nWhile original bitcoin continues to allow this small group of miners to remain in control, the hard fork created new protocol in bitcoin gold that allows people and organizations with less powerful machines to mine bitcoin gold. The fork further decentralizes bitcoin, which some pundits believe helps prevent it from a potentially crippling cyberattack.\n\nA hard fork isn't necessarily a good thing for bitcoin\n\nSome folks within the bitcoin community would suggest that a hard fork is a smart move by bitcoin. If there's disagreement over the future of bitcoin or its blockchain, the community gets to sound off, and changes are made so that everyone's happy. Plus, as noted, the fork into two (more) currencies provides further decentralization of the network, which could come in handy if cybercriminals wanted to pray on bitcoin.\n\nBut the second fork in three months for bitcoin may not necessarily be viewed as a good thing. For starters, it's really confusing for the layman investor. The concept of virtual currencies and blockchain can already be challenging enough for a new investor to understand, so adding in another dimension of virtual currencies spinning off new virtual currencies is just a recipe for confusion. There's already enough emotion-driven trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, and these forks are liable to create even more volatility.\n\nPerhaps the bigger issue is that these forks expose a fatal flaw in the \"finiteness\" argument of owning bitcoin. While it's true that protocols limit the number of mined bitcoin to 21 million, forking into separate currencies allows bitcoin to move beyond these limits by creating a new currency. Additionally, it's always possible the protocols in bitcoin could be rewritten to allow more mining, meaning it may not be as scarce as you realize.\n\nNew virtual currencies can also struggle to gain appeal, with bitcoin gold crashing as much as 66% following its debut. Few cryptocurrency exchange platforms have OK'd trading in bitcoin gold, and the website for the new currency has been overloaded with requests, crashing the server.\n\nThese risks, when coupled with regulatory concerns and a low barrier to entry in developing blockchain technology, could cause bitcoin to lose its luster. Despite bitcoin's hefty returns this year, I'd suggest keeping your distance from a situation that's looking more like a bubble with each passing day.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

GM will be the anchor tenant of the building and have a 15-year lease at the Hudson site.\n\nThe move is a major score for Gilbert, but leaves many unanswered questions over the future of the RenCen, which GM bought for pennies on the dollar in 1996 without needing a mortgage to do so. In moving, GM walks away from unneeded office space, but it takes on the cost of rent. GM did have operating costs, such as taxes, utilities and janitorial expenses at the RenCen.\n\nGM President Mark Reuss said GM would incur costs in the move, but declined to provide specifics or say how much rent GM will pay. GM owns five of the seven towers at the RenCen, and Barra assured the crowd that GM would work with developers on possible uses for the RenCen once GM vacates it, but she said the Hudson building is, \"a very historic site for Detroit and one that's very personal to me,\" adding it is a \"new city landmark.\"\n\nBuy that dream house: See the best mortgage lenders\n\n\"It's important to all of us at GM that we continue to call Detroit our home for a long time to come,\" Barra said.\n\nGM to move people from RenCen and Warren\n\nHudson's Detroit is the new 1.5 million-square-foot development by Bedrock, the real estate firm of Gilbert, chairman of mortgage lender Rocket Companies Inc. The project’s skyscraper topped out last week at just over 681 feet, making it the second-tallest building in Detroit, behind the central tower of the Renaissance Center.\n\nBut this move is a significant downsizing in the automaker's square footage. Reuss said GM will occupy the top two floors of the building, but commercial real estate brochures show each floor is just under 50,000 rentable square feet. At the RenCen, GM has access to 2.3 million square feet in office space.\n\n\"We don't know exactly how many people we're going to take from the RenCen, from Warren and populate this, because we're architecting the offices,\" Reuss said. He added that the GM corporate staff will be moving — top executives, along with finance, communications, legal staff and human resources.\n\nGM has had four different headquarters locations within Detroit in its 115-year history, and Barra said the Hudson building is \"a perfect fit.\"\n\n\"We'll be the signature tenant of this state-of-the-art building,\" Barra said. \"We'll have space to display our vehicles and host events with all the modern amenities you'd imagine from a developer like Bedrock.\"\n\nMore:Detroit's RenCen history dates back to 1977: Key facts about GM's downtown HQ\n\n'A new path forward'\n\nThe Hudson’s site consists of two side-by-side buildings: a 12-story “office block” with over 500,000 square feet of office, commercial and events space, and a 45-story skyscraper that is expected to house an ultraluxury Edition Hotel and about 100 condos and apartments. The Hudson’s site project broke ground in December 2017, and the buildings could be substantially completed by the end of this year.\n\nThe development is on the site of what was once the world's tallest department store, but Hudson's closed its downtown location in 1983, and the building was imploded in 1998, leaving a vacant surface lot until Gilbert started his project.\n\nGM will occupy the top two floors of the office building and have a publicly assessable showroom, Reuss said. He said GM does not anticipate receiving any tax incentives to make the move, but he did not rule out incentives connected to RenCen redevelopment.\n\nFormer Detroit Free Press business columnist and reporter John Gallagher has covered the city extensively and wrote the book, “Reimagining Detroit: Opportunities for Redefining an American City.” Gallagher called Monday’s news, “The major real estate story of the year.”\n\n“It’s great for Gilbert’s building. It immediately gives it that star billing,” Gallagher told the Free Press. “The question was: How are they going to fill that up? But by having GM world headquarters there, that makes it the most desirable building in Detroit.”\n\nGM’s move solidifies central downtown with “perhaps a few thousand” GM employees filling it and bringing added revenue to the businesses along Woodward, Gallagher said. The added foot traffic will help Midtown and Corktown liven up as places to live and recreate, he said.\n\nBut the home run for the Hudson leaves a big question about the future of the RenCen, he said.\n\n“What happens to the RenCen?” Gallagher asked. “GM still owns it, but I am not sure what happens to it. The waterfront itself is far enough along that this will not hurt the waterfront at all.”\n\nBarra promised that GM will partner with Bedrock, the city of Detroit and Wayne County to \"plot a new path forward\" for the RenCen over the next year or so.\n\nDuggan promises a future for RenCen\n\nGM has had its headquarters at the RenCen since 1996. That's when the automaker purchased five of the seven towers there for $73 million, according to the Detroit Historical Society. GM occupies four of the towers, with the Marriott in the fifth. Farmington Hills-based Friedman Real Estate said it bought the RenCen's 500 and 600 towers in December for an undisclosed price from a New Jersey utility company that had owned them for years.\n\n\"We'll explore new ideas for the complex, including the possibility for commercial, residential or mixed use, and we're grateful for collaboration with a visionary like Dan who has had such an impact on the resurgence of downtown Detroit in recent years,\" Barra said.\n\nBedrock has purchased around 100 downtown buildings, starting in about 2010. Gilbert moved his mortgage operations downtown and has set about renovating buildings, adding residences and curating retail operations in the city core.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan said that it was about six years ago when Gilbert first proposed pitching Barra on moving GM headquarters to the Hudson building.\n\nGilbert said, \"From the beginning, we understood the significance of Hudson's to our city, which is why we designed it to be more than just a building. We built these buildings to be a destination celebrating Detroit over the past century and strengthening that momentum for generations to come.\n\n\"Most importantly, we wanted to be a place that would attract the best companies and the best talent from all over the world. Who knew we would attract the one from around the corner here?\"\n\nHe added: “GM represents more than just a new office anchor, it solidifies the company’s commitment to the city they have called home for more than 100 years. The building will have it all: state of the art exhibition and meeting spaces, luxury hotel, living amenities, exciting restaurants and bars and destination shopping. Hudson’s is located right here in the heart of downtown sitting along iconic Woodward Avenue, America’s first paved road.”\n\nDuggan promised that the parties will find the right solution for the long-term use of the RenCen.\n\n\"We have the right leaders,\" Duggan said. \"It's gonna take some time, we're gonna get the right result. But we are going to make sure that as GM comes here for celebration, we also have cause for celebration at the Detroit Renaissance Center.\"\n\nGallagher said if Bedrock takes over the RenCen in some way, whether Bedrock buys it from GM at some point or takes over management, it may be good news for the iconic riverfront complex.\n\nGallagher said of Bedrock: “They’re pretty smart guys, so they might manage that building better than GM can. If you look at what they did downtown with all the shops and restaurants they curated up and down Woodward … if I was betting on the future of the RenCen, I’d bet on Bedrock more than GM.”\n\nSteve Morris, with Axis Partners in Farmington Hills, said apartments are probably not an option, given the high costs of adding plumbing to each unit. Further, demand for apartments in Detroit has slowed.\n\nOffice space is an option, but Detroit already has high vacancy rates and demand is low, Morris said.\n\nThe vacancy rate for office space in downtown Detroit was 19.4% in the first quarter of this year, up from just under 13% in late 2019, according to past market reports from the Newmark real estate firm.\n\nAccording to Axis, the city’s central business district has 232 million square feet of office space, but just over 4 million of that total is vacant, and another 334,000 is subleased space that is also available and less expensive.\n\nThe RenCen already has a hotel, but Morris said it’s possible to add another. Medical offices or facilities are another possible option, but would be expensive to build.\n\nMore:Hudson's site skyscraper reaches full height, is Detroit's 2nd tallest building\n\nGM's logo was a beacon reflecting the city\n\nThe RenCen is arguably Detroit’s most recognizable building, and GM’s brightly lit logo at its top serves as a beacon along the city's skyline, reflecting Detroit's spirit. When the logos went dark in November 2023, it sent social media into a frenzy with speculation that GM had abandoned the building. But as the Free Press reported, GM was replacing the lighting as part of routine maintenance at the time.\n\nGM has used the logos atop the RenCen to both celebrate and mourn with the city.\n\nIn August 2018, the automaker and its luxury brand Cadillac paid tribute to Motown legend Aretha Franklin after she died by lighting the top of the building pink with the word \"Respect.\" The pink referenced her hit song \"Pink Cadillac\" and \"Respect\" was the title of her classic 1967 hit. In 2011, GM saluted the Red Wings after they won a playoff game by changing the top of the RenCen to the red-and-white Wings' logo. That same year, an old English \"D\" topped the RenCen for the Tigers' Opening Day. After Prince died in 2016, GM lit the top of the RenCen purple to honor the musician.\n\nMost recently, GM animated the lights at the top of the building to include a lion's tail on it in support of the Detroit Lions' playoff run in January.\n\nGM's mandate was helping businesses at the RenCen\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily population of workers at the RenCen has been dwindling as many of GM's employees, who once occupied the offices there, worked from home. Earlier this year, GM mandated its workers come in on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week, which has helped boost foot traffic in the RenCen to help restaurants and other businesses that rely on office workers for daily business.\n\nSteve Ali, owner of Salsarita's Fresh Mexican Grill located in the RenCen’s food court on the lower level, said the reports Monday that GM planned to move from the RenCen was “a shock, to say the least.”\n\nLast month, Ali and other restaurant owners in the food court told the Free Press that business had slowly started to pick up with GM’s mandate that people work from the office three times a week.\n\n“I was hoping I’d see a gradual improvement over the year with the number of tenants in there,” Ali told the Free Press on Monday. “I didn’t see this one coming. This doesn’t put us in a very good position. This is very shocking and disappointing. I am not sure where it’s going to leave us — even if they redevelop it, it will be a very long time before it’s a viable four towers again.”\n\nBut closer to the new building, the news was met with enthusiasm. Mootz Pizzeria + Bar is a restaurant on Library Street behind the new Hudson’s tower. Walter Gregorio, Mootz’s director of operations, called GM’s move “fantastic.”\n\n“I think it’s fantastic for GM,” Gregorio said. “GM is getting a new spot and it is great for us.”\n\nTony Sacco, Mootz owner and partner, added that GM’s move is “going to help the core downtown.”\n\nReduced number of workers at the RenCen\n\nExactly how many GM employees are still assigned to work at the RenCen these days is unclear and GM is not saying. In October 2022, the Free Press reported that about 5,000 employees were assigned to work at the RenCen, even though many continued to work remotely.\n\nGM's website said in early March that 857 employees were working at the RenCen. At the time GM spokeswoman Tara Kuhnen said that number had not been updated to reflect increases since implementing the return-to-office policy in January, but she declined to provide an updated figure. According to a screenshot of GM's website dated Oct. 3, 2023, which was obtained by the Free Press, GM listed 1,320 employees assigned to the RenCen then.\n\nKuhnen confirmed a \"small number\" of employees have been transferred to other locations within southeast Michigan in recent years as the business and hybrid work arrangements evolved, but she declined to provide specific figures.\n\nMore:Detroit's RenCen is at a crossroads — and only GM knows what's next\n\nFree Press staff writers Jennifer Dixon and Susan Selasky contributed to this article.\n\nContact Jamie L.

It’s a huge win for the UAW that has major significance for the auto industry.\n\nThe vote happened at Ultium’s first-ever plant in Warren, Ohio, which started production of batteries for GM’s new line of electric vehicles in September. Early Friday morning the union announced 710 had voted in favor of the union and only 16 opposed, with about 900 workers eligible to vote in the election.\n\n“As the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, new workers entering the auto sector at plants like Ultium are thinking about their value and worth,” said UAW President Ray Curry. “This vote shows that they want to be a part of maintaining the high standards and wages that UAW members have built in the auto industry.”\n\nUltium released a short statement Friday: “We respect the decision of our Ohio workforce supporting representation by the UAW. We look forward to a positive working relationship with the UAW.”\n\nEV battery plants needed as the industry shifts\n\nTraditional automakers are rushing to build EV battery plants across the United States as they rush to meet ambitious goals to shift from vehicles powered by traditional internal combustion engines [ICE] to EVs.\n\nLike Ultium most of those battery plants are joint ventures with battery makers rather than wholly owned by the automakers themselves. That means the workers at those new plants will not be part of the UAW unless they vote to join.\n\nThe shift to EVs planned by the industry has huge implications for the industrial union, since it takes an estimated 30% to 40% less labor to assemble an EV than a traditional car, which has far more moving parts.\n\nMany of the jobs at automakers go into building engines and transmissions, which are replaced by small electric motors and large battery packs in EVs. So it’s crucial for the UAW to be able to organize these slew of joint venture battery plants popping up nationwide.\n\nWhile GM (GM) is not the sole owner of the plant, its executives welcomed the union in hopes it helps to maintain labor peace with contract talks looming next fall.\n\n“We’re a company that’s worked with unions around the world for many years, so we welcome Ultium having union representation,” said GM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday ahead of the vote in comments reported by the Detroit Free Press and confirmed by GM.\n\nGM, along with rivals Ford (F) and Stellantis face contract talks with the UAW in fall of 2023. GM suffered a nearly six-week strike, greatly focused on job security issues after the closing of the plants in Lordstown and elsewhere.\n\nIt makes sense for the company to not fight the unionization effort as have other companies facing union vote, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have done this year, said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\n“GM is going fully EV, and the last thing they want is to battle the UAW,” said Ives. “This sets a significant precedent on this first vote.”\n\nContracts\n\nNow comes the big question: What kind of contract the workers will get. Ultium said its workers an average of $18 an hour, while veteran hourly workers at GM get a top pay of $32.32 an hour. GM has indicated it can’t afford to pay Ultium workers anywhere near that much.\n\n“Ultium Cells is committed to providing competitive total compensation packages,” said Ultium in a statement. “Our wages and benefits are determined by the company through benchmarking competitors, market conditions and what it takes to attract and retain the talent we need to be successful.”\n\nTypically wages at auto suppliers are significantly below what is paid by the automakers. But it’s not clear if the union will see these jobs are more akin to supplier jobs or the jobs making engines or transmissions at automakers’ own plants as they set their bargaining goals.\n\nBarra said Thursday that GM is interested in Ultium reaching a first contract with the union “as soon as possible.”\n\n“We’ve got to be competitive to have a company and go forward,” she said. “We’ve had that conversation with employees on the floor and they get it.”\n\nThis year has seen a surge of union organizing votes, with a successful campaign to organize 270 Starbucks (SBUX) stores nationwide, an Amazon (AMZN) warehouse in Staten Island becoming the first Amazon (AMZN) facility to vote for union representation, along with two Apple (AAPL) stores becoming the first Apple (AAPL) locations to vote to join unions.\n\nBut among those high profile union votes, only the Amazon facility had more workers than the Ultium factory. Besides the Amazon facility, the only larger employers to have their workers vote to join a union so far this year were the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where 3,800 graduate students were in the group that voted nearly two-to-one in favor of union representation, along with hospitals in Pasedena and Palo Alto, California and Portland, Maine, where groups of nurses voted to join unions.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/10/13/sammy-hagar-ferrari-laferrari-sold-rock-hall-performance/75635212007/", "title": "Sammy Hagar is all smiles after selling his Ferrari: For how much?", "text": "Sammy Hagar just provided another example of how there's only one way to rock.\n\nHis recipe: Have a ball but keep to life's speed limit, easy on the drugs, heavy on the rock 'n' roll, and – above all – go all in on smart business decisions.\n\nHis latest score? Selling his prized 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari at auction Saturday at the fabled Barrett-Jackson gathering in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nHagar bought the supercar – customized in a rare creamy cappuccino color, among other things – new from the iconic Italian automaker for around the then-staggering MSRP of $1.4 million. He just passed the vehicle along to its next happy owner at a hammer price of $4.25 million. Not a bad gain. At press time, the buyer's name was not available, as is often the case with multi-million-dollar vehicle sales.\n\n\"Quite honestly, it was exhausting being part of the bidding war,\" Hagar told USA TODAY shortly after the auction concluded. \"I'm thinking the whole time, do I really want to do this? Seller's remorse and all. When that gavel came down and they said 'Sold!,' I wasn't sure if I was heartbroken or relieved. What an experience.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHagar had flown in for the showcase auction from his longtime escape pad and performance venue, the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. And he promptly hopped back on his jet, painted in the same color scheme as his (former) LaFerrari, after the sale closed in order to be back in Cabo for his annual birthday bash party. Hagar turned 77 Oct. 13.\n\nBut the trek to Arizona was more than worth it despite his busy travel schedule of late, he said.\n\n\"I was so happy after I met the person that bought my car,\" Hagar said. \"He was so cool, he sees the car the way I always saw the car. Which is that we're just being caretakers of something special, and then you pass it on to another caretaker. So you're just looking in each case for someone who will preserve and take care of the legacy of a car that has this level of perfection.\"\n\nCraig Jackson, CEO of Barrett-Jackson, said he was “honored and excited to have sold my friend Sammy Hagar's stunning LaFerrari. We had no doubt we’d find it a good home. Sammy and the new owner connected after the sale and it felt right. We found the LaFerrari a good home.”\n\nSammy Hagar's Ferrari LaFerrari has broken a sales record for its model year, auction house says\n\nHagar's car, one of a dozen or so exotics the \"I Can't Drive 55\" singer has collected, was supposed to go up for sale in January earlier this year. But the temperamental stallion ― its 950-hp hybrid engine can rocket the car to 60 miles an hour in 2.5 seconds ― needed a replacement for its specialized battery.\n\nThe LaFerrari features not only a rip-roaring a V12 gas-powered engine, but also (in a first for the Maranello factory) powerful electric motors. The battery helping keep the car in top shape carries a five-figure price tag and had to be sourced from Ferrari, which only made the LaFerrari model for a few years a decade ago.\n\nHagar's LaFerrari far outpaced the sales price of other cars up for sale at Barrett-Jackson Saturday. Those included a 2019 Ford GT for $880,000, a 1971 Ferrari GTB/4 Daytona Coupe for $506,000 and a 2023 Rolls Royce Cullinan Mansory Edition SUV for $396,000.\n\nA quick search for other LaFerraris up for sale this year includes scant information about sale prices, making Hagar's sale a new benchmark of sorts. According to Barrett-Jackson officials, prior to Hagar's sale the highest price paid for a 2015 Ferrari LaFerrari was $3,910,000 in August 2022 at Broad Arrow Group Auctions.\n\nIn recent months, another major auction house, RM Sotheby's, had two LaFerrari models on the block in both Monterey, California, and Paris, with, respectively, a 2015 black version selling \"after auction\" for an undisclosed sum, and a white LaFerrari not selling. It had an estimate of between $4 million and $5 million and it's likely the bidding simply didn't meet the buyer's reserve price.\n\nFellow Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Rod Stewart connected with Hagar recently over their shared passion for cars, especially Ferraris. Stewart was on the hunt for his own unique-spec LaFerrari, and wound up buying one very similar to Hagar's, although in white and not cream.\n\nSammy Hagar says his Ferrari LaFerrari 'is a Libra'\n\nMost Ferraris are red, or rosso Ferrari. Yet this model's unique color scheme was inspired by Hagar's jet. When he and wife Kari traveled to the fabled factory in Maranello, Italy, to design their custom LaFerrari, that jet took center stage.\n\nHagar's car is truly personalized in other ways. Beyond his cappuccino-vibe color scheme, the carbon fiber steering wheel features his initials as well as his birth date. A longtime fan of numerological alignment, Hagar was giddy about how things were lining up for the sale.\n\n\"I received the car on my birthday, on Oct. 13, 2016, and on the steering wheel is a small silver plaque that says 'SH1013.' After the sale, I'll be celebrating my birthday, knowing that just as happy will be the lucky person that lands this, the most beautiful LaFerrari of them all,\" he says. \"Oh, P.S., it's a Libra.\"\n\nWhile those millions on the LaFerrari are impressive, they actually pale when compared to some of Hagar's other savvy business decisions made over a lifetime of wheeling and dealing. His top score to date has to be his $100-million sale of Cabo Wabo tequila to Gruppo Campari a decade ago. And Hagar's never looked back, starting another liquor business, Santo Tequila with celebrity chef Guy Fieri, followed more recently by the Red Rocker Brewing Company.\n\nNo telling what Hagar will do with his new found lucre. But the rocker recently made some interesting noise while receiving the key to city of Las Vegas.\n\n“I’ve got plans. The Cabo Wabo Resort and Casino,” Hagar said while in Sin City for the honor and a concert (Hagar's Cabo Wabo Cantina has been a fixture on the Strip for many years). “I really still plan on doing it, and this is the town I want to do it in. If not here, I’ll find another one. Folks, embrace me on this!”\n\nHagar and his band the Circle have been on road much of the summer, and Hagar is poised to appear solo at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

Tuesday: The EV age and climate change\n\nWednesday: Consumers and automakers embrace EVs\n\nThursday: Charging stations and other EV challenges\n\nSales data is driving Hyundai's interest in producing more EVs. The automaker's sales of EVs were up 64% in the first half of 2022.\n\nHyundai and its sister brands Kia and Genesis will boast a combined 30 EV models by 2030, a daring plan that will set them apart from most automakers. But they will have fierce competition from Toyota, which will more than double Hyundai’s number of models globally by 2025.\n\nFord, General Motors and Nissan have an impressive lineup of EVs and will be major players too.\n\nIt’s not easy being green\n\nEVs currently make up 9% of new car purchases globally, and less than 10% of those are sold in the U.S.\n\nWhile those numbers are fairly low, automakers think offering more models will catch the attention of consumers who bat their eyes at EVs. Car manufacturers are making a big push for carbon neutrality, trailblazing a path for cleaner air and saving consumers thousands of dollars at the pump and on maintenance repairs.\n\nCase in point: Richmond Hill's Maxim Milchman. He could not wait to get his hands on the Tesla 3. He was intrigued by the technology and the aesthetics of the car. It was love at first sight, and he purchased a Model 3 in October 2020.\n\nBut after several rides, Milchman said his experience was not what he expected it to be.\n\nSeveral months later, he sold it.\n\n“Imagine you are driving a sedan, but the experience is like a convertible,” said Milchman. “It makes all kinds of noises. The quality is very poor.”\n\nDetermined to find his dream EV, Milchman did some research and came across the Hyundai IONIQ 5. He was skeptical at first, thinking it could not outperform Tesla.\n\nBut it did.\n\nHyundai Motor Group: Savannah, Chatham leaders celebrate new auto plant in Bryan County\n\nHyundai is coming to Bryan County. Here's how the region prepares for state's largest project.\n\nCity Talk: Hyundai plant presents many economic opportunities, development challenges\n\n“I was extremely surprised,” said Milchman. “I didn’t expect it to be that good. It is high quality and has very good suspension. It’s almost like you are driving a Rolls Royce. You don’t feel anything when you are driving.”\n\nLast September, he ordered the Tesla Y hoping he could own at least one vehicle within the Tesla family. But he was surprised to learn that model did not have noise-cancellation built in either.\n\n\"The suspension is not as good,\" said Milchman. \"The Tesla is much faster right? But I'm not driving on a track, so I don't care about that. It is much better than the Tesla 3, but it is still noisy. Tesla is not as good as Hyundai. With the Hyundai, the noise cancellation is much better. There are no squeaks, no nothing. The overall experience in the Hyundai is much better.”\n\nMilchman had the luxury of purchasing three EVs in a short amount of time. But most Americans cannot afford to buy one. Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motors, is on a mission to change that through its “progress for humanity” campaign. Its lowest-priced EV, the Kia Kona, lists for $34,000.\n\nEven moderately priced EVs such as the Nissan LEAF ($27,800) are out of reach for some buyers.\n\nPrice points for a Tesla Model 3 and the Mustang MACH-E — arguably the most talked-about EVs available today — are $40,000 and $43,900 respectfully. Milchman paid around $53,000 for his Hyundai IONIQ.\n\nGabriel said higher sales will lead to lower cost EVs over time.\n\n“There are many factors involved with the pricing of eco-friendly vehicles, including economy of scale,” said Gabriel. “Large-scale production of battery electric vehicles allows for economies of scale with pricing, and we expect fuel cell technology to be a cost-competitive renewable energy source as well once it achieves economy of scale.”\n\nFor now, though, that does not lessen the blow when it comes to the car payment, and replacement batteries for EVs can cost anywhere between $5,000 and $15,000.\n\nAlthough EVs are environmentally friendly, drivers say it all comes down to how much they are saving at the pump. With gas prices rising, Milchman refused to buy a non-EV. He said it is an expense that cannot be avoided and one he wanted to axe from his budget.\n\n“I don’t like to pay for gas,” said Milchman. “It doesn’t make sense. The car is expensive. It’s an everyday spending thing and something I don’t like.”\n\nBut the caveat for EV buyers is to be mindful about where charging stations are located and having an alternative vehicle for emergency trips such as evacuations or a long-term power outage.\n\n“I don’t mind the look and for a daily commute they might be a good alternative,” said Sandra Marston of Richmond Hill. “But I definitely wouldn’t want to go on a longer road trip in an EV. Also friends of mine in Louisiana were out of power for two months after a hurricane, so there is that.\"\n\nWho will become the biggest EV giant?\n\nWith Hyundai and Toyota becoming major players in the EV industry, Ford's Emma Bergg said the American automaker had to \"swing for the fences\" to ensure its lineup of EVs would compete with the others on the market.\n\nRather than break into the field with new-to-the-market EV models, Ford decided to electrify two of its most iconic model brands: the sporty Mustang and the F-10 pickup truck.\n\n\"This was a pivotal question for Ford’s future. And we had to match the moment with a bold decision,\" Bergg said.\n\nHyundai will also face stiff competition from Toyota. By 2025, Toyota plans to have 70 EV models globally, including 15 all-electric vehicles.\n\n“Toyota has always embraced electrification of vehicles from the start of electric powertrain vehicles in 1997 in Japan with the hybrid Prius and understands their importance in meeting customer wants and needs,” said a spokesperson for the company.\n\nThe EV age has also spawned startup automakers, and not just Tesla. As of June 30, Rivian has produced nearly 8,000 vehicles. Models include the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV, which will be built at a new plant located in Rutledge, a small town 70 miles east of Atlanta, announced late last year.\n\nEach automaker brings something unique to the table, so the climb to the top of the EV mountain will be arduous. The rapid production and number of new models in coming years mean EV buyers will have a host to choose from. Only time will tell as to who will be at the forefront of the EV evolution.\n\nLatrice Williams is a general assignment reporter covering Bryan and Effingham County.

Fields said the automaker will add about 200 jobs at its plant in Hermosillo, Mexico to make the Focus but did not say how much it would invest.\n\n\"The reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars,\" Fields said.\n\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford called Trump this morning to inform the president-elect of the decision, and Fields called incoming Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"They were very pleased that we are investing here in the United States,\" Fields said.\n\nTrump tweeted a link to a Fox News story and quoted a headline from the story that said, \"Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan; CEO cites Trump policies.\"\n\nFields also said officials in Mexico were told this morning about plans to cancel the $1.6-billion plant. Last April, Ford said it would create 2,800 jobs in Mexico at the new plant.\n\n\"Obviously there is some disappointment,\" Fields said. \"We have been in Mexico for over 90 years, and we are going to be moving our Focus down to our plant in Hermosillo, so we are going to be safeguarding the 2,900 jobs that are there, plus we are going to be adding about 200 jobs.\"\n\nMore Ford news:\n\nFord F-series Super Duty is the 2017 Free Press Truck of the Year\n\nFord leads automakers in patents for 2016\n\nWho needs humans?

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Pine Knob action will resume May 22 with Neil Young, part of a five-month season scheduled to wrap up Sept. 28 with WRIF-FM’s Riff Fest, headlined by the veteran hard rock band Godsmack.\n\nThe 2024 season doesn’t wield quite the firepower that ruled in 2023, when Detroit’s summer calendar was loaded with mega draws such as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Morgan Wallen, Drake and Ed Sheeran. Ford Field, the region’s largest venue, hosted nine shows and more than half a million concertgoers for the busiest stretch of music in the stadium’s 22-year history.\n\nIndeed, last year was the biggest ever for the North American concert business, as the live-events industry continued to revel in a post-pandemic rebound: The top 100 tours alone generated $6.63 billion in grosses, according to data collected by the trade magazine Pollstar, with at least $1 billion of that coming from Swift’s Eras Tour.\n\nThis summer is teeming with hot shows, and here we break out some highlights for what's coming through October.

It's part of a fast, remarkable rise for the Oklahoma artist and U.S. Navy veteran, whose only Detroit show until now was a Majestic Theatre gig in 2021.\n\nHe'll be followed at the downtown stadium by George Strait (July 13) and Kenny Chesney with the Zac Brown Band (Aug. 10).\n\nFor Chesney, this will be the 12th headlining performance in the Lions’ den, the most for any artist since the stadium's 2002 opening. His August visit with Zac Brown will feature Detroit’s Uncle Kracker in the opening slot.\n\nAt Comerica Park, there are two shows on the docket: Def Leppard and Journey will serve up rock hits July 18, while Green Day will bring its Savior Tour with guests Smashing Pumpkins and Rancid on Sept. 4.\n\nWelcome back\n\nThe summer schedule includes a handful of folks we haven’t seen in a while, including the reunited rock band Creed, which will play Pine Knob on July 31 before returning Nov. 20 for a night at LCA. Those will be the first Creed shows here in 12 years for Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti and company.\n\nSmooth-singing George Strait, a pioneer of country music stadium concerts, will make his first Michigan appearance since his avowed retirement tour in 2014. Strait is now firmly back in the saddle and headed to Ford Field on July 13 with Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town in support.\n\nHip-hop veteran and freshly minted Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Missy Elliott, meanwhile, will play the first Detroit headlining show of her career when she hits LCA on Aug. 15 with Busta Rhymes and Ciara. Her last major Motor City performance came as part of Eminem's Ford Field stand in 2003.\n\nNeil Young has been no stranger to Michigan venues in recent years, but his May 22 Pine Knob visit will be the first with his band Crazy Horse since 2004.\n\nFestival feats\n\nThe Movement festival will hold down its traditional Memorial Day weekend spot on Detroit’s riverfront as the much-loved techno event returns to Hart Plaza, May 25-27. Performers on six stages will include headliners Fatboy Slim, Richie Hawtin and Solomun, part a lineup of international acts and Detroit veterans — including hometown musical pioneer Kevin Saunderson in a set with actor-DJ Idris Elba.\n\nOn Michigan’s west side, Electric Forest will kick into action June 20-23, presenting another sprawling lineup of electronic artists and jam bands, with headliners to include Pretty Lights, String Cheese Incident, Disco Biscuits, Charlotte de Witte and more.\n\nFaster Horses, July 19-21 at Michigan International Speedway, will reassert its status as one of the biggest country music events in the U.S., this time with a country-rock crossover bill led by Hardy, Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson.\n\nConcert of Colors, set for Midtown Detroit, July 15-21, will unveil full details this week, including the fest's artist lineup, an expanded venue list and a new series of neighborhood events happening throughout the summer.\n\nFor Labor Day weekend, a pair of local traditions will return: The Detroit Jazz Festival will take over downtown with a four-day lineup led by drummer great Brian Blade, the 2024 artist-in-residence.

Other biggies at the amphitheater include Maroon 5 (June 21), Janet Jackson (July 2), Imagine Dragons (Aug. 12) and Glass Animals (Aug. 24).\n\nLCA will also welcome brotherly trio AJR on June 30 and Jennifer Lopez on July 31. Billie Eilish, fresh off another round of Grammy and Oscar wins, will arrive Oct. 7 for the second Detroit arena performance of her career, while Pink will serve up a twofer there Oct. 14-15.\n\nMeghan Trainor, playing metro Detroit for the first time in eight years, will wrap up Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre's season when she performs Sept. 30.\n\nR&B treasure trove\n\nThe Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre will fill Detroit’s riverfront with soulful sounds and smooth jazz, kicking off its season June 5 with Lalah Hathaway and a summer of Motor City favorites including the Isley Brothers (June 16), Kem (Aug. 2) and Sheila E (Aug. 14). More shows at the Aretha will be announced in coming weeks.\n\nFollowing his big comeback moment at the Super Bowl halftime show, Usher is headed to Little Caesars Arena for a Sept. 12-13 doubleheader on his Past Present Future hits tour.\n\nAlso at LCA, Jhené Aiko will bring her Magic Hour Tour on June 19, Xscape and SWV will summon ’90s energy Aug. 9, and Maxwell will serenade audiences Oct. 11.\n\nA Latin phenomenon\n\nLast month, Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny notched a milestone show at a sold-out Little Caesars Arena, drawing 16,000-plus for a night of all-Spanish-language pop music. There's some broader context to that Detroit breakthrough: The Recording Industry Association of America, which tracks streaming stats and album sales, recently reported that Latin music revenues in the U.S. hit $1.4 billion last year, up 16% from 2022.\n\nNow, less than a year after his own local sellout at Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre, Mexican singer Peso Pluma is poised to headline LCA on June 1 as Latin music’s growth accelerates in Detroit. Following the summer concert season, Colombia's Shakira will play the same downtown arena Dec. 15 as part of her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran world tour.\n\nHomegrown hot nights\n\nBeyond the array of local talent you’ll find nightly across metro Detroit’s clubs and bars, there are some notable homecoming performances in store: Gladwin-bred rapper NF will play the biggest Michigan show of his career with a May 14 visit to LCA, while Detroit metalcore quintet I Prevail is set for a July 13 headlining spot at Pine Knob.\n\nMotown mainstay Kem will light up the Aretha amphitheater on Aug. 2, and there’s an exciting new jazz project from some well-pedigreed local veterans: Don Was, Dave McMurray and Luis Resto will make their Motor City debut as the Pan-Detroit Ensemble on May 24 at Orchestra Hall.\n\nA swan song\n\nThere’s always an end of the road, and this summer’s most notable goodbye will come from Jeff Lynne’s ELO, whose Over and Out Tour plays LCA on Oct. 9, putting a bow on a 54-year run for the adventurous pop-rock project once known as Electric Light Orchestra.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2023/10/05/power-trip-festival-2023-live-updates/71073635007/", "title": "Power Trip live: AC/DC wows with stellar comeback, Metallica delivers", "text": "For those about to rock, we salute you.

But while Tool sounded crisp and loud, and thousands appeared to enjoy the band's set at the festival, it inevitably felt like a let down after AC/DC, and as festivalgoers were gearing up for a highly anticipated show from Metallica.\n\nMetallica, on the other hand, understood their assignment. Closing out a once-in-a-lifetime festival such as Power Trip is no easy task, and the California rockers didn't disappoint on Sunday night,\n\nRead our full Tool review here.\n\nRead our full Metallica review here.\n\n—Brian Blueskye and Andrew John\n\nPower Trip proves itself to be an international affair\n\nWhat’s the furthest someone traveled to Power Trip? It’s hard to say, but Indio resident Leonard Ortiz has something that provides answers. Since Friday, Ortiz has collected signatures from attendees and their origins on a California state flag. Some of the attendees who signed included residents of Australia, Nepal, Austria, and Colombia. Ortiz said there was also “a lot of Mexico on there.”\n\nOrtiz said he got the idea to track signatures at Power Trip from attending Metallica concerts and seeing fans with flags from their home states doing the same.\n\n“I just thought it would be cool to do (at Power Trip),” because I knew that AC/DC and Iron Maiden have a following from all over the world, and I want to put it (the flag) up in my mancave. People are really digging it, and I’ve only had one person tell me no when I’ve asked them to sign for whatever reason,” Ortiz said.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nThe most rockstar-worthy burger at Power Trip comes from Grill 'Em All\n\nThere’s one food vendor in the South Lounge area of the festival that gets our unofficial award for Most Clever Play on Words: the metal-inspired and Alhambra-based burger restaurant Grill ‘Em All, which is a take on Metallica’s 1983 debut album “Kill ‘Em All.”\n\nDesert Sun reporter Andrew John tried the AC/DC burger and enthusiastically said “It’s good!” after taking his first bite.\n\nThe restaurant is known for showing pro wrestling and a selection of burgers named after metal icons such as Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica and more.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nHoly Dive Bar provides sports fans and non-sports fans alike a shaded place to kick back, grab a drink\n\nRob Vollgraf traveled to Power Trip from Northern California with the understanding that he’d be able to watch his Las Vegas Raiders at the Holy Dive Bar. He'd heard about the setup inside Empire Polo Club, but was skeptical about whether it would be anything substantial.\n\nOn Sunday, the festivalgoer admitted he was pleasantly surprised.\n\n“They’ve done an outstanding job here,” said Vollgraf, wearing a black Raiders shirt. “This blew away my expectations.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nTool brings fans from around the world to the polo grounds\n\nWhen Alejandro Grijalva Duran saw the lineup announcement in March for Power Trip and noticed the band Tool was part of it, he immediately contacted his son, Juan Pablo Grijalva Saenz. The two purchased tickets and made travel arrangements to Indio from Chihuahua, Mexico.\n\nOn Sunday, the father and son had just waited in line at Tool’s merchandise booth and was taking pictures with a poster they'd purchased. Power Trip is the first time the two will see the band perform.\n\n“(Tool) is a unique band,” Grijalva Saenz said. “You see the lineup and all the classic rock bands, having Tool in the lineup at this festival is mind-blowing. Their concept in music is different than other bands like Judas Priest, AC/DC and Iron Maiden, so it’s a unique occasion to see Tool at this festival and venue.”\n\nGrijalva Duran is a longtime fan, and said there are limited opportunities to see Tool in Mexico, who typically perform in cities such as Monterrey or Guadalajara.\n\n“I like a lot of Tool’s music and have been a fan since the beginning,” said Grijalva Duran.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nReal metal fans take their grandkids to Power Trip\n\nBrooklyn Harper and Illy Pirylis of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, both 17, have been enjoying Power Trip this weekend with their grandmother, 59-year-old Kerri Yingst of Hobe Sound, Florida. But it's not the first time they've rocked out at a concert together.\n\nIt's the third festival the trio have attended together since the 2022 Welcome to Rockville festival in Daytona Beach.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, all three were excited to see the first performance by AC/DC in seven years and spent over an hour standing in line at the band's merchandise tent after the gates opened. Yingst referred to her granddaughters as her \"concert buddies\"\n\n“I didn’t know they liked my music,” Yingst said. “I was (in New Jersey) visiting and I heard Black Sabbath coming from the bedroom, and I’m like ‘Wait a minute, maybe they’re just on YouTube.’ I go about my business and go back upstairs, and I asked them, ‘Do you like that?’ and they said ‘Yeah!’ That’s when we found Welcome to Rockville and started going to festivals together.”\n\nTo read the full story, click here.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nAC/DC starts out strong despite seven-year performance hiatus\n\nShortly after AC/DC performed “Shoot to Thrill” about an hour into their Saturday set at Power Trip, CNL Executive Transportation owner and operator Craig Blucher was heading towards the exit to give a client a ride.\n\nBut as he walked, the San Diego resident who has seen AC/DC seven times described the set as “epic.”\n\nBlucher’s first time seeing AC/DC was during the original lineup era featuring original frontman Bon Scott, who died in 1980. He also caught the band’s comeback tour that same year with current vocalist Brian Johnson.\n\nSince AC/DC released the album “Power Up” in 2020, the band hasn’t played together live, meaning Saturday’s performance was its first show in seven years.\n\nEven though AC/DC is celebrating 50 years, the band hasn't announced a new album or any plans to tour, leaving many to speculate whether Power Trip may be the group's last performance.\n\nWhen asked if he thinks it will be the last, Blucher said he hopes not.\n\n“They need to stay healthy and they’re getting old. These old timers don’t live forever,” Blucher said.\n\nCheck out AC/DC's setlist here.\n\nCheck out our full review of AC/DC's set here.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nJudas Priest announces new album, brings out Glenn Tipton\n\nJudas Priest replaced Ozzy Osbourne as the first band on the Power Trip Day 2 schedule, but they didn't act like anyone's second choice.\n\nAfter five decades, the English heavy metal group proved it still has plenty of gas in the tank, far exceeding expectations. The crowd cheered as Black Sabbath's \"War Pigs\" played as the intro, but was followed by a few moments of silence before a graphic showed on the video screens announcing Judas Priest's upcoming album, \"The Invincible Shield,\" which is due out March 8.\n\nPerhaps the best moment of the set was the encore, which featured guitarist Glenn Tipton, who retired from the band in 2018 due to Parkinson's disease. Tipton performed with the group during the last three songs of the set: classics \"Metal Gods,\" \"Breaking the Law\" and \"Living After Midnight.\"\n\nClick here to read the full Judas Priest setlist.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nCoachella has 'Spectra,' Power Trip has the rocker cactus\n\nWhile concertgoers are not allowed inside \"Spectra,\" the popular illuminated installation that features a winding ramp, right next to it is a new piece of art that has many lined up to take a selfie with.\n\nA blue devil-horned-shaped cactus has caught the attention of many here at Power Trip. It has provided a perfect photo-op for this metal festival, with Spectra, the ground’s iconic Ferris wheel and the mountains of La Quinta providing a cool backdrop.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nPower Trip's hottest accessory will cost you $20, and sellers prefer cash\n\nOne thing most festivalgoers probably didn't expect at Power Trip, which markets itself very openly as a cashless festival, is a vendor that asks for cash. That's exactly what fans are facing when they go to purchase light-up AC/DC devil horn headbands at one of the various vendor carts scattered across the festival grounds today.\n\nAlthough these vendors technically take credit cards (because they have to to be part of the festival), the signs on the carts read \"$ CASH IS KING !!!\"\n\nThe night's hottest accessory, which will set you back $20, is a nod to AC/DC co-founder, lead guitarist, songwriter, and only remaining founding member Angus Young, who popularized the devil horn symbol by using his two index fingers to form two horns above his head while he performs.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nJudas Priest proves to be the most punctual band of Power Trip thus far\n\nJudas Priest just took the stage, just a few minutes later than scheduled, unlike the Friday performers who were 20 minutes (Iron Maiden) and 40 minutes (Guns N' Roses) behind schedule. Now let's see if they can make Ozzy proud.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGroup of fans decide to push through the Power Trip gates early\n\nThose of us who entered Day 2 of Power Trip through the Red Path/camping area got a surprise Saturday when a group of rowdy festivalgoers decided they didn't want to wait any longer and pushed the gates open. Security nearby let it happen, seemingly because they were going to open the gates themselves a few minutes later, and because those who pushed through were hit by a wall of metal detectors and bag checkers on the other side of the gate.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGuns' N' Roses delivers the hits to close out the first day of Power Trip\n\nGuns N' Roses put on a phenomenal show of heavy rock 'n' roll hits and treated festivalgoers to highlights of the band's career, even paying tribute to Sir Paul McCartney's 50th anniversary of the James Bond anthem \"Live And Let Die.\" The two-hour set was full of stunning video production and lasers, but notably no pyrotechnics.\n\nEven though the band was 40 minutes late for its headlining performance, the crowd was calm and there were no signs of the old days when the band would appear hours late or not at all. When the festival went dark and the band's strange animated psychedelic visuals appeared, the crowd was on its feet, screaming in anticipation.\n\nStarting with \"It's So Easy,\" frontman Axl Rose appeared like a lightning rod and the rest of the band, which also features original members guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan, were precise in every note.\n\nClick here to read the band's complete Power Trip setlist.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nOur highs and lows of Power Trip Day 1: Where's the good food hiding?\n\nOK, so festival food is famously never great, but Coachella always includes some trendy (and mouthwatering) Asian food from LA and Stagecoach always has delicious BBQ (when Guy Fieri's involved, you know it's good), so what is Power Trip going to be notable for cuisine-wise? So far, crappy grilled cheese.\n\nThat might be on me for ordering something a bit odd, but I thought you couldn't mess up grilled cheese! It's so simple! Tomorrow I'll be going in a totally different direction and heading straight for the booth of a Palm Springs favorite: Sandfish.\n\nRead up on our other highs and lows from the first day of the festival here.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nParking causes headaches on Power Trip Day 1, leads some to leave early\n\nParking for those who tried to get in after 4:30 p.m. today was reportedly out-of-this-world difficult (our own photographer nearly ran out of gas in the middle of Miles Avenue because traffic controlers forced him to circle the venue so many times), which seems to be the reason why many people were seen leaving the festival after the first hour of Guns N' Roses' set.\n\nI can't blame them for wanting to beat the traffic, and I can't help but wonder how long it's going to take me to get out after Guns N' Roses is done playing ... moral of the story: get here as early as possible tomorrow, festivalgoers.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nIron Maiden delivers theatrical, energetic set to kick off the night\n\nAs Iron Maiden kicked off the first set of Power Trip performing \"Caught Somewhere In Time,\" frontman Bruce Dickinson appeared as if he stepped into the present day from a futuristic sci-fi film set.\n\nThat post-apocalyptic vibe continued throughout the stellar performance, which included stage visuals showing the flux capacitor from the 1985 time travel comedy film \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nWant to see the complete set list? Click here.\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Brian Blueskye\n\nMetal fans came from all over the world for this event\n\nAs the rumors began circulating about Power Trip in March, Rob Myers of Hershey, Pennsylvania created the Facebook community “Power Trip Festival Group,” which has over 10,000 members. On Friday afternoon, Myers met a fraction of the group in front of the Ferris wheel for a group photo. A group member brought a California state flag and is having members sign it as he meets them at the festival.\n\nMyers said he has created similar groups for festivals such as the Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival in Mansfield, Ohio and estimates 5,000 attendees from all around the world and demographics joined the Power Trip group during April.\n\n“People had interest in seeing six powerhouse acts all at once,” Myers said. “These bands have international recognition – Guns N’ Roses, Iron Maiden, Metallica – even in Europe, you don’t see all three of those bands at one festival. You may see one, but you’re not going to get all at once.”\n\nThe members of the group have posted invites for carpooling to the festival, social gatherings in the area and even shared travel tips for those new to the Coachella Valley. There’s a stronger sense of community among metal fans for this festival than the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach country music festival.\n\n“If you go to any metal festival, especially if you’re in camping, you’re never going to have an empty stomach, an empty cup or go without anything you need,” Myers said. “I have met grandmothers and mothers at metal festivals and they’re the ones helping those who say ‘Hey, I need this’ or ‘I ran out of this.’ Everybody just wants to take care of each other. With metal, there are different emotions, some of these people have been hurt and have a stronger sense of empathy. I’ve noticed people who have been through something, metal is their healing.\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nOur first impression of the festival: spacious\n\nAlthough it was crowded by the entrance, once the gates opened 18 minutes behind schedule, our first impression of the festival was that it's wonderfully spread out. Nobody's on top of each other, and even though the merch tents were Coachella-level busy less than 15 minutes into the start of the festival, the Iron Maiden-specific and Guns N' Roses-specific booths had shockingly small lines.\n\nThis is also a little nerdy of us to notice, but the famed Coachella/Stagecoach Ferris wheel (aka Le Grande Wheel) is back with new open-air cars (as opposed to the traditional enclosed cars we're used to at the other two festivals).\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nPower Trip: Gates are open and crowd has cool cross-generational vibe\n\nThe gates are open at Power Trip but the music has yet to start. The crowd so far consists of lots of big groups and families with adult children. \"How you holding up mom?\" was heard from a man who appeared to be in his late 30s or early 40s.\n\nThose who attended the original \"Trip\" ... Desert Trip in 2016 that featured the kings of classic rock ... will understand.\n\nAlso notable about the first hour on scene: It's hot. Overheard waiting to get through the gate: “I’m sweating so much I’m losing my buzz, it’s terrible!”\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Kate Franco\n\nHeaded to Power Trip but don't want to miss the game? You can experience both\n\nGoldevoice is typically all about the music. But this weekend at Power Trip, the promoter is offering a rare opportunity to watch live sports at one of its bar areas within the festival.\n\nAll weekend long, festivalgoers can head to the Holy Dive Bar to watch the following televised sports:\n\nThursday: NFL Chicago @ Washington\n\nFriday: MLB Playoffs\n\nSaturday: MLB Playoffs\n\nSaturday: NCAA Football\n\nSunday: NFL Football\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Andrew John\n\nPower Trip pre-game: Free tattoos at AC/DC-themed pop-up bar in Indio\n\nAC/DC will hit the stage for the first time in seven years during the second day of Power Trip, but you don't have to wait until Saturday to get in on the fun.\n\nClub 5 Bar in downtown Indio has officially opened as a pop-up fan experience called the AC/DC High Voltage Dive Bar, featuring collectible rock relics, unique Easter eggs, a beer garden food trucks and, perhaps most notably, free tattoos of the many different AC/DC logos over the band's 50-year history.\n\nIf you're looking for a place outside the festival grounds to honor the gods of rock, this is your spot.\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Brian Blueskye\n\nPower Trip special guests: Who we think might make a stage cameo\n\nWould it even be a Goldenvoice festival without surprise special guests? Here's a few we're hoping to see (and yes, some are far-fetched, but we can dream):\n\nWith Guns N' Roses:\n\nMisfits frontman Glenn Danzig (to sing \"Attitude\")\n\nBob Dylan (to sing that cover of \"Knockin' On Heavens Door\")\n\nWith AC/DC:\n\nAC/DC could quite possibly bring out any rockers, but ... wouldn't it be amazing if they brought out actor/singer Jack Black for the cover of \"It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\" from the movie \"School of Rock\"?\n\nWith Metallica:\n\nKing Diamond (to sing \"Mercyful Fate\")\n\nSt. Vincent, Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor, or another artist who performed on the \"The Metallica Blacklist\"\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Brian Blueskye\n\nPower Trip set times: When will Tool, Guns 'N Roses, Metallica take the stage?\n\nNeed some help planning your Power Trip? Here are the set times:\n\nFriday, Oct. 6: Iron Maiden at 6:45 p.m., Guns N' Roses at 9:25 p.m.\n\nIron Maiden at 6:45 p.m., Guns N' Roses at 9:25 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 7: Judas Priest at 6:45 p.m., AC/DC at 9:25 p.m.\n\nJudas Priest at 6:45 p.m., AC/DC at 9:25 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 8: Tool at 6:55 p.m., Metallica at 9:35 p.m.\n\n—Ema Sasic\n\nWhere is Power Trip festival 2023?\n\nPower Trip, which features six heavy metal bands from Friday, Oct. 6 to Sunday, Oct. 8, is being held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Music-lovers likely know (or know of) the venue as the home to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach country music festival, which are held on the lush grounds at 81-800 51st Ave. over three weekends in April.\n\nBut this isn't the first October \"Trip\" staged by Goldenvoice. Desert Trip, featuring Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Neil Young and Promise of the Real, Roger Waters and Paul McCartney, was held at the polo grounds over two October weekends in 2016. It was heralded as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see some of the biggest names in classic rock on one stage.\n\n—Kate Franco\n\nFrom the archive:When Desert Trip rocked the music world in 2016", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/11/14/phoenix-concert-news-listings-announcements/71580074007/", "title": "Phoenix concerts announced: Jelly Roll, Justin Timberlake, Deftones", "text": "Justin Timberlake, Deftones and Heart have announced new dates at Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix while the Coors Light Birds Nest has announced that Jelly Roll will join Luke Bryan as a headliner at the 2025 WM Phoenix Open.\n\nThat's the latest concert news for metro Phoenix, where other recent announcements include Thee Sacred Souls, Chief Keef and Becky G at Arizona Financial Theatre in Phoenix.\n\nYou’ll find details on how to get tickets, including presale information, in this running list of all the biggest tours headed our way, continually updated as concerts are announced to help you plan accordingly.\n\nIf you’re looking for something to do before those tours arrive in Arizona, you’ll want to check our monthly concert guide.\n\nDeftones at Footprint Center in Phoenix\n\nDeftones are bringing their 2025 North American Tour to Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix on March 9, 2025, with special guests the Mars Volta and Fleshwater.\n\nNeed a break?

The event appears to be focused on criticizing the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her ties to California.\n\n“Under Kamala Harris and her dangerous Democrat allies like Tim Walz, the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans,” states the campaign email announcing the event. “Californians are suffocating under rising prices for everything from groceries to housing, thanks to Kamalanomics.”\n\nThe event is public, and people who want to attend can register online.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump last visited Coachella Valley in 2020\n\nTrump is no stranger to the valley. While still in office in early 2020, Trump held a fundraiser at the Rancho Mirage estate of Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison. Trump’s visit brought dozens of supporters to greet him at Palm Springs International Airport, cheering him on with chants of “Four more years!”\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Trump’s opponents rallied near Ellison’s estate in Rancho Mirage with signs and a large balloon mocking the president. The counter-protest was organized by Courageous Resistance, a progressive local political group.\n\nUnlike the upcoming event, which has registration open for the public to get tickets, the 2020 event was private and cost a minimum of $100,000 per couple to attend, with a higher ticket price of $250,000 for those who wanted to participate in a policy roundtable with the president.\n\nThe full guest list for the Rancho Mirage fundraiser was not made public, but local gas station mogul Nachhattar Chandi was among those who said he was attending. The president’s arrival at the airport also drew some local political figures, such as Jeff Gonzalez, a Marine veteran and pastor who’s running as a Republican for a state Assembly seat this year; conservative radio talk show host Rich Gilgallon; and Joy Miedecke, president of the East Valley Republican Women Patriots club.\n\nMore: Donald Trump's past golf historyDonald Trump part of legacy of golf and the presidency in Coachella Valley\n\nWho owns ranch where Trump will hold rally?\n\nTrump's rally will be at a property owned by the Haagen Co., a firm connected to the family that founded the Empire Polo Club, home to the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals, in 1987.\n\nThe polo club's music festival history dates to 1993, when rock band Pearl Jam was looking for somewhere to play that didn't sell tickets through Ticketmaster.\n\nAlexander Haagen III's 110-acre club seemed perfect to Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett and his late partner, Rick Van Santen. The concert ended up drawing 25,000 Pearl Jam fans. In the next decade, Haagen went on to double the size of his property and create a landscape design unique in the polo world.\n\nIn 2022, the Indio City Council approved a request from Alexander Haagen IV to rename the Avenue 51 right-of-way stretch, half a mile west of Monroe Street, to Haagen Way. But ahead of the vote, a few residents spoke in opposition to the change, citing what they say are negative repercussions in the city from the festivals the Haagens host.\n\nThe Haagen Co. also has been involved with other business ventures in the Coachella Valley, including a since-scrapped plan to redevelop the mall long known as Indio Fashion Mall.\n\nThe land where Saturday's rally will be held is in unincorporated Riverside County, just west of Coachella city limits.\n\nWho will attend Trump rally in Coachella Valley?\n\nIt’s unclear which local elected officials and political candidates could appear on stage at Trump’s rally Saturday, but at least one statewide candidate — Steve Garvey, California’s Republican candidate for U.S. Senate — told The Desert Sun in a text that he won’t be there.\n\nInstead, Garvey will be out of the state accepting an award at the International Symposium on Women in Sports Media in Philadelphia. Garvey's daughter, Olivia, is a past sports anchor at NBC Palm Springs and is now a sports anchor at KNBC in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump has recently criticized Garvey, saying at an event in Rancho Palos Verdes earlier this month that the former Dodger “made a big mistake because he hasn’t reached out to MAGA, and if he doesn’t have MAGA he’s got no chance.”\n\nMiedecke, president of the East Valley Republican Women Patriots, told The Desert Sun on Monday that her club was aware of the rally before Monday's announcement, but she was unsure of who's joining Trump for the rally. She said her club members will be \"very involved\" with the event.\n\nCoachella mayor, U.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz oppose Trump rally\n\nSeveral elected officials in the eastern Coachella Valley condemned Trump’s rally following Monday’s announcement, with Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez saying Trump “wasn’t invited by the people who live here.”\n\n“The City of Coachella was proud to welcome Senator Bernie Sanders during the 2020 primary election, but news of former President Trump’s upcoming visit has been met very differently,” Hernandez said. \"Trump’s attacks on immigrants, women, the LQBTQ community and the most vulnerable among us don’t align with the values of our community.”\n\n“He has consistently expressed disdain for the type of diversity that helps define Coachella,” the mayor added. “We don’t know why Trump is visiting near Coachella, but we know he wasn’t invited by the people who live here. He ain’t like us.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Indio, echoed the sentiments, saying it’s “truly appalling — and yet another demonstration of his cluelessness and ignorance — that Donald Trump would stage a rally in Coachella” in a statement shared with The Desert Sun.\n\n“Under a second Trump administration, there is literally no place in America that would be harmed more than the Coachella Valley,” Ruiz said, referring to Trump’s tariff policies, his “hate-driven immigration policy” and his “ignorant opposition to clean energy.”\n\n“Donald Trump — and his policies — are an affront to everything that makes the Coachella Valley a vibrant community,” Ruiz added.\n\nCoachella City Councilmember Frank Figueroa and Indio City Councilmember Waymond Fermon also condemned the rally in prepared statements, with Fermon calling Trump “a threat to our needs and to democracy itself.”\n\nBeyond the event’s likely focus on Harris and her ties to Democrat-led California, it’s unclear why Trump’s campaign is holding the event near Coachella, where registered Democratic voters outnumber their Republican counterparts by a roughly 4-to-1 margin.\n\nCoachella’s population is also roughly 98% Latino, while about 41% of its residents were born outside of the United States. During his 2024 campaign, Trump has repeatedly used racist rhetoric to describe undocumented immigrants, calling them “animals” and “not human,” while saying people crossing the Mexican border are fueling violent crimes in the U.S.\n\nTrump has long history with Coachella Valley\n\nTrump’s history with the valley stretches back several decades.\n\nThe former president, known for his love of golf, plays regularly in Florida and along the East Coast and owns golf courses throughout the United States and in Scotland. But he has rarely played golf in the desert, most notably in the 1993 American Express tournament, known then as the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.\n\nThat tournament annually invited celebrities from entertainment and sports as well as politicians to play alongside PGA Tour pros. At the time, Trump was known for his books and television appearances but was still a decade away from hosting \"The Apprentice\" television show.\n\nYears later, in 2001, Trump had a big plan for a casino in Coachella. Despite its being the smallest casino in the Coachella Valley at the time, he invested in Spotlight 29, a bingo parlor operated by the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians, a tribe of just 12 members — recognizing its potential for profit.\n\nLeveraging his reputation, Trump raised funds for an extensive expansion that would introduce slot machines, table games, a stylish nightclub and a private lounge for high rollers. In return, the tribe appointed him as the casino's manager and rebranded the casino as Trump 29 in 2002.\n\nBut three years later, Trump’s multibillion-dollar resort company filed for bankruptcy and subsequently, the tribe terminated his management contract early, buying him out for a mere $6 million — less than than the contract had earned him in a single year. Trump’s name subsequently came off the building.\n\n“When Trump came in, we all thought, ‘Oh gosh, he is going to really run the tables on the tribe,’ and it was actually just the opposite that happened,” Victor Rocha, an Indian gaming advocate from Temecula, told The Desert Sun in 2016. “But it shouldn’t have been a surprise. If you look at anything that guy has done in this industry, he has a lead thumb — it’s the opposite of a golden touch.”\n\nTrump has mocked Palm Springs windmills for years\n\nA day after flying into Palm Springs for the 2020 fundraiser, Trump took shots at a familiar fixture of the desert landscape: the windmills that Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley are known for.\n\nDuring a campaign speech Colorado Springs, where he discussed energy independence, Trump reminded his audience about the \"rusty,\" \"rotting\" windmills made in \"China\" and \"Germany.\"\n\nHe told his audience: \"And they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs. ... They're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell.\"\n\nWindmills in the Palm Springs area date back about four decades, and in recent years, energy developers here have replaced some aging wind turbines with state-of-the-art models.\n\nIt wasn't the first time he tilted at the windmills.\n\nIn 2016, during Herman Cain's radio show, then-candidate Trump referred to Palm Springs as a \"poor man's version of Disneyland.\"\n\nHis disdain for windmills goes back to at least 2012, where he tweeted about how Palm Springs had been \"absolutely destroyed\" by \"the world's ugliest wind farm\" along Interstate 10.\n\nThe Desert Sun staff contributed to this report.\n\nTom Coulter covers the cities of Palm Desert, La Quinta, Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells.
