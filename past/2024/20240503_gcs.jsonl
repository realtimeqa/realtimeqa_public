By using it against members of the Oath Keepers the Justice Department is expressing that it sees the breach of the Capitol as a grave threat to the operation of the US government.\n\n“They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy,” prosecutor Jeffrey Nestler told jurors Monday morning as the trial began.\n\n“To charge someone with seditious conspiracy is to send a signal that not only have they done a bunch of bad stuff,” said Alan Rozenshtein, a former official in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, “but that they’ve done bad stuff that rises to the level where we as the government want to express that this is an attack on the basic functioning of a democratic system and is even more dangerous for that reason.”\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland balked at initial efforts to add the charge to Oath Keepers case, CNN previously reported, but as the case developed, investigators were able to build out the evidence with cooperators and internal communications. The charge was added in a superseding indictment unveiled in January.\n\nThat symbolic significance will be lingering over the trial happening in the DC federal courthouse – beginning with opening statements Monday – in the coming weeks. There, five alleged members of the Oath Keepers, including leader Stewart Rhodes, will face a jury considering whether to convict them of the charge and of other alleged crimes.\n\nThey’re accused of planning to use force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power, with the grand jury indictment alleging that they “coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes’s call to take up arms at Rhodes’s direction.” The defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nRELATED: DC residents say they can be impartial as potential jurors in Oath Keepers trial but emotions remain raw over Jan. 6 attack\n\nBefore the Justice Department unveiled the seditious conspiracy count against Rhodes and several other far-right activists, there had been significant handwringing among the legal observers about the absence of the charge that, by its name alone, carries palpable political weight.\n\n“I don’t believe that it was done without a lot of thought put into it. It has a shock value,” said Jeffrey Ian Ross, a criminologist at the University of Baltimore.\n\nThe bread and butter of the Capitol mob prosecutions so far has been an obstruction statute, commonly used for witness tampering, that has been used to accuse the rioters of interfering with an official proceeding. Misdemeanors for unlawfully parading in the Capitol and disorderly conduct have also been used as low-hanging fruit against January 6 defendants, and those who acted violently during the breach have faced assault charges and the like as well.\n\nSecuring a jury conviction of the seditious conspiracy charge could help justify how the Justice Department has conducted its January 6 investigation and rebut claims that the riot was merely a protest that got out of hand.\n\n“It does have this term ‘seditious conspiracy,’ and so that sort of brings to mind this broader issue of sedition: that you have somehow sort of betrayed the government in in some way,” said Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California at Davis and an expert in treason law.\n\nA charge sometimes viewed as risky\n\nThree Oath Keeper defendants have already pleaded guilty to the charge. It carries a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe history of the seditious conspiracy statute dates back to the start of the Civil War, when Congress made it a crime to conspire to overthrow the US government or to conspire to use force to “prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.”\n\nIn the infrequent cases that prosecutors have brought the charge, they have not always been successful securing a conviction.\n\nThe last time it was charged – against a Michigan militia accused of plotting an attack on law enforcement – the count was dismissed by a judge in 2012 who said the Justice Department failed to show that there was a “concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States government.”\n\nThe way allegations of seditious conspiracy may run into constitutionally protected free speech can pose a problem for prosecutors, according to Mark Satawa, one of the defense attorneys who represented the Michigan militia members.\n\n“The act of speaking, the act of talking about something – and that something may be the overthrow the United States government – but it’s still talking,” he told CNN. “And so the act itself runs afoul of these very deeply held beliefs that we have as a people, this idea that we should be able to bitch about our government.”\n\nIn the January 6 case, prosecutors are pointing to alleged statements from Rhodes calling for a “civil war” to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s win, as well as concrete steps the Oath Keepers are accused of taking to plan for a violent encounter.\n\nEfforts to undermine the legal case for seditious conspiracy\n\nMuch of the legal debate over the charge centers on what exactly the Oath Keepers were plotting to do, as the statute addresses conspiracies aimed at impeding the government’s ability to do its business. Because the charge is so rarely brought, there is little case law fleshing out the parameters of the crime.\n\nThe defense attorneys argued in pretrial proceedings that Congress’ Electoral College certification ceremony did not meet the statute’s standard for an execution of a law – an argument Judge Amit Mehta rejected in declining to dismiss the count.\n\nOutside experts see the legal case for this particular seditious conspiracy charge as especially on point, in part because of the nature of the government operation the defendants were allegedly seeking to disrupt.\n\nThe alleged conduct, Rozenshtein said, was not aimed at personally enriching the defendants.\n\n“It was more an ideological objection to the government doing not just any law, but one of the most foundational laws in American democracy, which is the peaceful transition of power.”\n\nThe Oath Keepers’ attorneys have signaled a defense that will argue that that the activists, in their preparations for January 6, were not intending to disrupt government operations, but were readying themselves to respond to any invocation by then-President Donald Trump of the Insurrection Act.\n\nMehta is allowing that defense to a limited extent, but ruled the Oath Keepers could not discuss the legality of or what’s required to invoke the law, which authorizes a president to deploy state militias to suppress rebellions against the government.\n\nEven if the Justice Department’s theory of the case meets the legal definitions of seditious conspiracy, getting a conviction also requires convincing the jury that there is evidence to back up the allegations.\n\nBecause of the reservations jurors may have about criminalizing political speech, prosecutors will need to go above and beyond with the evidence they present, according to Satawa.\n\n“I think they’re looking for pretty persuasive, maybe even overwhelming proof that this person truly intended to incite a rebellion or overthrow the government before they’re going to convict them of talking, and particularly convicted of committing a crime of an agreement to talk,” Satawa said.\n\nThere have been indications that the defense will argue that the Oath Keepers entered the Capitol not to disrupt the certification proceeding, but to aid law enforcement battling the mob.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, have previewed the use of communications between some of the defendants during the breach that the government says shows that the aim of their actions in the Capitol was to target lawmakers. They’ve signaled intentions to play for the jury video from the attack as well.\n\nThe indictment indicates investigators also obtained pre-January 6 encrypted text messages showing the alleged planning for the attack, as well as evidence around militia training sessions and the purchase of firearms and tactical gear ahead of January 6. Prosecutors are additionally expected to put on the witness stand Oath Keepers who pleaded guilty and are cooperating in the case.\n\nRozenshtein argued that the evidence the jury will be considering is straightforward and what makes the case feel novel is how rarely there is a circumstance that warrants bringing the charge.\n\n“It’s not that it’s hard to prove seditious conspiracy. It’s just a criminal charge, like anything else. If you have the facts, you can prove it,” he said. “It’s just that generally, we haven’t seen a lot of … forced ideological attempts to keep the government from doing its business, in a way that rises to the level of seriousness that DOJ thinks that it’s appropriate to bring.”", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/donald-trump-jr-meadows-text/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We control them all': Donald Trump Jr. texted ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, as votes were still being tallied, Donald Trump’s eldest son texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that “we have operational control” to ensure his father would get a second term, with Republican majorities in the US Senate and swing state legislatures, CNN has learned.\n\nIn the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/watchdog/2017/02/15/fethullah-gulen-charter-schools-islamic-cleric-new-jersey/94574618/", "title": "Investigation: Charter school leaders, founders linked to ...", "text": "Jean Rimbach, Jeff Pillets, and Hannan Adely\n\nNorthJersey\n\nA group of charter schools that arose from North Jersey’s Turkish community is rapidly growing in the state, with seven schools collecting more than $60 million in taxpayer money last year alone to fund their growth.\n\nNow, an investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com shows that some founders and leaders of the schools have close ties to the movement of Fethullah Gulen, the controversial Islamic cleric accused of working to overthrow the government in his native Turkey last summer. Gulen has denied the charge and is fighting extradition demands as he lives in a secluded compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, about 10 miles from the New Jersey border.\n\nThe 75-year-old Gulen, in his writings and public comments, espouses a modern Islamic society that embraces education, interfaith dialogue and tolerance. Sympathy for the movement is strong among key figures who pioneered the North Jersey charter schools.\n\nSome belong to Turkish émigré groups that tout the cleric's teachings. There are also political donors who collectively have furnished hundreds of thousands in donations to U.S. office holders while the North Jersey charter schools in general have been adept at wooing state and local government officials with trips to Turkey and, in some cases, jobs.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nRecords show the charter schools also have been a channel for state taxpayer money to private entities that serve the schools as landlords or vendors — in one case, a Wayne boarding school that is openly Gulen inspired.\n\nIn Turkey’s capital of Ankara, President Recep Erdogan (err-doe-wan) — some critics say in an effort to solidify his power and move toward authoritarianism — has purged thousands of suspected \"Gulenists\" from the government. He is also pressing the Trump administration to break with former President Barack Obama and immediately dislodge the cleric and send him home to stand trial as a domestic terrorist who they claim was behind the July 2016 coup attempt.\n\nOfficials in the turbulent Turkish republic have maintained Gulen is leveraging a network of more than 100 charter schools nationwide and U.S. tax dollars to support revolution back home that would put his followers in power.\n\n“It’s clear these schools were being used both to raise funds for Gulen and employ Gulen followers and teachers and basically have them tie a percent of their income back to Gulen,” said Robert Amsterdam, a London-based lawyer hired by the Turkish government who is investigating charter schools in the U.S. that he alleges are linked to Gulen.\n\nThe United States has not classified Gulen or his followers as a terrorist group, and some officials have characterized the cleric as an antidote to Islamic extremism. The Trump administration has not made an official policy statement about Gulen.\n\nGulen disavows any role in the Turkish coup or terror attacks there, and he has long denied a connection to the Turkish-led charter schools in the United States.\n\nLeaders of the New Jersey schools interviewed for this story say their charters, spread across a dozen locations stretching from Hackensack to Somerset County, have no formal link to the reclusive preacher. The schools exist solely to provide good secular education for the large numbers of public school families seeking better outcomes for their children, they say.\n\nAs the international controversy around Gulen swirls, the Turkish-led schools in New Jersey continue to collect tens of millions of dollars in state financing and local tax support, public records show.\n\nThe Record's review raises key questions about state oversight of the schools even as Governor Christie – who visited three of the North Jersey locations last year – pushes to rapidly expand the charter movement across the state:\n\nThe investigation found:\n\nA state-financed property deal involving the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology also benefited its landlord, a private group with close ties to the Gulen movement:\n\nThat group sold the property and used the proceeds to help open a new campus in Wayne for its private boarding school that caters largely to students from Turkey and hews so closely to Gulen's teachings that the Turkish government has closed down access to its web site and halted financial transactions involving the school.\n\nPublic money, in fees and rent that could amount to millions of dollars over time, continues to flow to the charter school's new landlord, a firm with multiple ties to Turkish charter schools in New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nConnections run deep among people involved with the schools, Gulenist groups and Turkish charter schools elsewhere in the U.S:\n\nTwo of the New Jersey schools, for example, have a founder who has served as a director at the New York-based Alliance for Shared Values, considered the voice of the Gulen movement in this country.\n\nThe CEO of iLearn Schools Inc. – an Elmwood Park-based non-profit that manages four of the local charter schools – comes from a charter network in Texas that the Turkish government claims is linked to the Gulen movement.\n\nThe schools and their vendors have successfully courted prominent public-school educators and political figures.\n\nThe state’s top charter school regulator, Harold Lee, left his post last summer for a job at iLearn.\n\nSecurity consulting contracts at four of the schools worth more than $90,000 a year are held by ex-Bergen County Sheriff Leo McGuire, who took a 10-day trip to Turkey before he left office in 2010 with his family and local Turkish nationals tied to the schools. It was paid for in part by a Gulenist group.\n\nMore than $30 million in long-term, low-interest loans have been granted by the state to benefit the Paterson science and technology charter despite its continuing financial and academic troubles:\n\nIn 2014, a Wall Street ratings agency downgraded the bonds issued for its expansion to junk status because the school’s revenues had fallen. Last year, Wall Street lowered its overall outlook on the bonds to “negative.”\n\nTracking tax dollars spent by the schools can be difficult because of loopholes in state law:\n\nILearn, which is set to add a fifth charter to its chain this year, declined to answer routine requests for information about its payroll, saying that as a private contractor it is not subject to the state Open Public Records law.\n\nState officials said it is unclear if such charter-management organizations fall under the law, even though charters draw their funding directly from the tax-funded budgets of regular public schools.\n\nGulen’s followers maintain the campaign against the American charters by the Turkish government is part of an attempt to smear and harass Gulen supporters wherever they live.\n\nThey dismiss the idea of a political or religious conspiracy operating through them and say Gulen’s movement is about hard work, peace and leading an ethical life. The movement’s Alliance for Shared Values maintains his devotees have simply been inspired to “promote education, particularly in math and science, by starting schools to serve disadvantaged communities.”\n\nIt is also clear, though, that local Turks sympathetic to Gulen have influence well beyond the charter schools and are skilled at building political capital. Civic and cultural organizations linked to Gulen are active in the community at large, holding academic competitions for students and interfaith and outreach events with politicians, law enforcement and the public.\n\nMembers of the organizations are vocal about issues that affect Turkey and have provided U.S. lawmakers and others like McGuire with trips to their homeland, including two Bergen County lawmakers, Sen. Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, financial disclosure forms show. Census figures show that Bergen and Passaic counties have the nation’s highest percentage of residents with Turkish ancestry among America's 3,000-plus counties. There are 5,200 in Bergen County alone.\n\nJohnson said he visited a Gulen university and met with a group of Gulenist educators. Weinberg recalled learning about the Gulen philosophy when she traveled to the republic with Johnson in 2011. Like the former sheriff, both legislators said they paid for airfare and the Peace Islands Institute, a U.S.-based group that considers Gulen its honorary president, picked up the costs for the 2011 trip. Johnson visited again in 2014 on a trip that was paid for, in part, by the Council of Turkic American Associations, which promotes Turkish culture.\n\nMcGuire said Gulen was not discussed on what he called a “spectacular trip” in 2008. But a brochure by the Turkish Cultural Center of New Jersey about the excursion quotes him as saying: “I now have many, many more Turkish friends. It is clear that those who have read the books of Fethullah Gulen have taken his message throughout Turkey and the world to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding.”\n\nChristie has repeatedly used the Turkish charter schools in New Jersey as a backdrop to his controversial push to expand the charter movement.\n\nIn June, as protesters gathered outside, he visited the high school campus of the Paterson science and technology charter and met with parents. In May, he stopped at the Hackensack location of the Bergen Arts and Science Charter School — an iLearn school — and traveled to the Thomas Edison EnergySmart Charter School in Somerset.\n\nIn a statement for The Record, the governor's office did not address specific issues with the Turkish schools but pointed out the popularity and success of charter schools overall.\n\n\"In general, qualified public charter schools are thriving and growing across New Jersey, because they have proven to be some of the most safe, successful, efficient and accountable educational environments,'' Christie spokesman Brian Murray said.\n\nA number of prominent Turkish nationals connected to the charters or their vendors have emerged as fundraisers and contributors to Hillary Clinton and Obama, among other political leaders. A former head of the Science and Technology charter in Paterson, Furkan Kosar, is the president of the Council of Turkic American Associations. Kosar raised more than $500,000 for Obama’s re-election bid in 2012. He did not return calls made to the council.\n\nCritics say the presence of big-money contributors connected to the schools in New Jersey and other states is evidence the cleric and his followers are advancing the Gulen movement at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.\n\n“They’re engaging in a series of activities that really don’t have anything to do with charter schools, and have much more to do with building political influence in the U.S. for his movement,” said Amsterdam, the lawyer for the Turkish government.\n\nAmong those critics is retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s recently ousted national security adviser who claimed American taxpayers “are helping finance Gulen’s 160 charter schools in the United States” in an op-ed piece written in November for The Hill, the congressional newspaper that assailed the Obama administration for allowing Gulen to remain in the United States.\n\nErcan Tozan, executive director of Peace Islands, dismissed the suggestion of the schools having any purpose beyond education.\n\nTozan said that the practice of hiring from the same pool of candidates – including Turks who worked in similar schools or who follow Gulen’s teachings – isn’t an issue. They may have shared connections, but they’re hired for their qualifications, he said.\n\n“Is it a problem to know each other and to know Mr. Gulen?” said Tozan, also a parent of a student at the Pioneer Academy, the Gulen-inspired private school in Wayne. “The Turkish community has really great connections.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Ercan Tozan as a board member of Pioneer Academy.\n\niLearn, the Elmwood Park-based nonprofit that manages four of the charter schools, hired Harold Lee last year as its chief strategy officer.\n\nThe job has duties that include seeking philanthropic funding and growing the firm in New York, officials said. ILearn Schools collects a steady and growing stream of tax money to manage charter schools in Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties. The firm is paid from 8 percent to 12 percent of the charters' annual operating budgets, and it plans to open a new school in Union County this year.\n\nWith Lee serving as New Jersey's lead charter school official for two years before iLearn recruited him, submissions from the company would likely have come before him. Both Lee and a spokesman for the state Education Department said he notified his superiors in May that he was in talks with iLearn and recused himself from matters affecting its schools. All charter-school applications are approved solely by the commissioner of education, the spokesman said.\n\nLee, in a written statement, said he decided to leave his state job because of iLearn's \"dynamic\" impact on public education in places that need it most.\n\n\"I came to iLearn Schools because I wanted to work for an organization that is truly making a difference in the lives of students and families each and every day,'' Lee said. \"This is a dynamic, innovative organization that is providing high-quality public education to students in areas that are in need of more quality educational options.\"\n\nNihat Guvercin, the chief executive of iLearn, declined to speak about Lee or release his salary, except to say it is in a range of $93,000 to $151,000. ILearn said it is not bound to release salary data or other detailed financial information about its operations because, as a private firm, it is not subject to the same open record laws that govern traditional public schools.\n\nIn a written response to questions, Guvercin said iLearn strictly adheres to all state laws, which he said are among the toughest in the nation on charter schools.\n\nA maze of connections links a group of charter schools rooted in New Jersey’s Turkish community with the movement of a reclusive Islamic cleric living in self-imposed exile in the Poconos, an investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com has found.\n\nA review of state records, websites, résumés and tax forms reveals how people involved with the schools are linked to groups that are viewed as sympathetic to Fethullah Gulen, the preacher accused of pushing for a revolution in his native Turkey.\n\nFor example, Nihat Guvercin, chief executive officer of iLearn, an Elmwood Park-based non-profit that manages four of the schools, is a former teacher and administrator at Harmony Science Academy in Dallas, one in an expansive network of charters targeted by the Turkish government as part of Gulen’s movement.\n\nGuvercin declined to be interviewed for this story, but he told The Record in 2013 that he admires Gulen – just as he admires India’s Mahatma Gandhi – but does not talk about his philosophy in class.\n\nMore recently, he emphasized in an email the schools are independent, with no religious or political affiliation. And he said questions about Gulen's philosophy and the backgrounds of school officials and contractors miss the point that schools provide good education to needy students.\n\n\"We have a waiting list in the thousands,'' he said. \"We provide quality, secular, public-school education in some of the most underserved urban communities in the state.\n\n“Rather than spending valuable time discussing global issues of no importance to the education of our students,” Guvercin added, “I commit myself both personally and professionally to the individual and collective success of our students, staff, and families.”\n\nOsman Oztoprak, a Clifton resident who most recent available tax records show has been a paid director at the Alliance for Shared Values – considered the voice of the Gulen movement in the United States – is a founder of the Bergen Arts and Science Charter School. It was the first school in what later became the iLearn chain.\n\nOztoprak, who declined to be interviewed through the Alliance, signed paperwork filed with the state in 2005 as the “charter school applicant representative.” The Record also submitted questions to Gulen through the Alliance, which they answered on his behalf.\n\nYears earlier, Oztoprak was among the founders of the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology, records show.\n\nThe Paterson charter has an additional connection to the Gulen movement. A founding partner of the school is the Milky Way Education Center, the non-profit that runs the private, Gulen-inspired Pioneer Academy in Wayne, documents show. Milky Way acquired a building, became the charter school’s landlord and loaned the school money.\n\nBut to the Turkish government, Pioneer Academy is much more.\n\nIn fact, the Turkish government so closely connects Pioneer to Gulen that since the attempted coup in 2016 – which it blames the cleric for – tuition payments from Turkish residents to Pioneer have been shut down and access to the school's website has been taken away in Turkey.\n\nPioneer’s leaders say they offer a secular curriculum and that the school incorporates Gulen’s view of education as a key to an ethical and service-driven life.\n\nOztoprak also was connected to Pioneer, serving as a principal and science teacher, and records also note he was one of its two founding teachers.\n\nAnother founder and former board president at the Paterson science and technology charter school, Candemir Toklu, went on to help found the Thomas Edison charter in Somerset, records show.\n\nToklu, who was identified as “lead founder” in the state application for Thomas Edison, also has served as Princeton area director of the Interfaith Dialog Center – now known as the Peace Islands Institute. The institute, which has an address in Hasbrouck Heights, on its website lists Gulen as its \"honorary president\" and provides an extensive biography of the cleric and his movement.\n\nToklu could not be reached for comment.\n\nOverlap also can be found between the people involved with the Gulen movement and vendors that serve some of the local charters.\n\nThe non-profit Apple Educational Services in Moonachie, for example, has been used by Pioneer and a number of the Turkish charters in New Jersey and other states. One of its corporate officers was an officer at the Interfaith Dialog Center, and at one point Apple and the center shared an address in Carlstadt, federal non-profit tax records show.\n\nThe name of Apple’s former treasurer also can be found on state paperwork as a vice president for Somerset-based EBRU TV – owned by the movement, according to an article posted on Gulen’s official website.\n\nOztoprak, meanwhile, was an education project manager at Apple.\n\nState documents show the company – whose services include database management, testing, tutoring and robotics training – serves about 30 schools in nine states in various ways; Apple’s executive director said it does not fund or support special-interest groups, Gulenist or otherwise.\n\nA subsidiary of Apple is the current landlord for the Paterson Charter for Science and Technology – the firm also has had stakes in land ownership for Turkish charter schools in Massachusetts and New York.\n\nJoshua Hendrick, a sociologist at Loyola University and an expert on the Gulen movement, said it was common for staff or board members to have worked at other Turkish-run charter schools across the country. They often use the same Turkish-owned firms for consulting, information technology, construction and other work, he said.\n\nAlp Aslandogan, president of the Alliance for Shared Values, said the hires are a result of networking and aren’t a problem.\n\n“People might come to know about other individuals through their social networks,” he said. “The important issue is if someone is hired by an agency, are they qualified to do the job?”\n\nPioneer Academy sits on 6.3 acres in Wayne. The marble-floored lobby and glass-walled rooms of the private, international school have a polished, modern look. Students put a finger on a scanner atop a turnstile to enter the spacious dining room in a building that is eight times the size of its old home in Clifton.\n\nThe $11 million property, a former corporate campus, was remodeled for the pricey boarding school, which caters to students from Turkey, charges more than $30,000 for tuition and boarding, and adheres to the teachings of Gulen.\n\nAn investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com found a state-financed sale of property rented by the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology helped to establish this sleek, new campus.\n\nThe sale netted millions for the group that runs Pioneer, which for years served as the charter school’s landlord.\n\nIt also put the charter's new landlord, a subsidiary of Apple Educational Services, a non-profit based in Moonachie, in line to collect taxpayer-funded rents and landlord fees indefinitely.\n\nThe bottom line: A private firm and not the public charter school owns the property and can choose to rent or sell it for a profit. And it began with funding from state taxpayers.\n\nIt’s the result of a complicated series of transactions that began in 2005 when, documents show, the non-profit behind Pioneer, the Milky Way Education Center, bought a building on Lehigh Avenue in Paterson for $2.75 million for the charter school’s use. The next year, the state Economic Development Authority stepped in with an aid package: $5.4 million in tax-free bonds to refinance loans Milky Way took out to buy and renovate the dilapidated industrial property on Lehigh Avenue.\n\nMilky Way collected rent serving as landlord to the Paterson charter – ultimately more than $1 million annually, contracts show.\n\nIn 2012, it sold the Paterson property to the Apple subsidiary for $10.5 million – part of a larger deal also financed by the state.\n\nMilky Way reported a net “gain” of $4.37 million on tax forms and the next year it moved Pioneer from Clifton to Wayne. Pioneer said funds acquired through the sale of the charter property in Paterson were used toward the new building for the private boarding school.\n\nPioneer Principal Tufan Aydin said in an email that Milky Way had invested millions of dollars to renovate the charter building and sold it to focus on its new boarding school, which required “a significant infusion of capital.” He said it approached Apple, which provides services to Pioneer, about purchasing the building.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded Paterson charter school, meanwhile, continues to pay rent on the same site – only now it pays the Apple subsidiary, instead of Milky Way.\n\nIn all, the Apple company received state financing of more than $30 million in 2012 to buy the property from Milky Way and an old mattress factory on West Railway Avenue that it renovated for the creation of the charter’s new high school.\n\nThe charter now pays more than $2.4 million annually to rent both properties – an amount that is more than $400,000 above the debt service on the bonds. Lease and state documents show the landlord can make annual fees amounting to at least 10 percent above the debt payments to bondholders. Over the life of the bonds, that would generate about $12 million.\n\nAn Apple official said in an email this is not all profit to his firm, noting the money goes to pay off other mandatory costs associated with the bonds and for other expenses. He did not provide a breakdown, but described the rent paid by the school as “certainly reasonable and within market pricing.”\n\nState law doesn’t allow charter schools to incur long-term debt, so it’s not uncommon for another entity to get involved. But there’s no limit on how long the charter can pay rent – and no provision in the current leases calling for the property to be transferred to the school once the bonds have been paid off.\n\nThe state Economic Development Authority said it’s not “in its purview” to assess the long-term impact on taxpayers of such deals – or to assure a charter school ends up owning its facility.\n\nBut critics say deals like this can end up hurting taxpayers.\n\nRutgers University Professor Bruce Baker, a nationally recognized expert on education financing, said charter-school economics in New Jersey could benefit outsiders at the expense of the public.\n\n\"In many ways, what we’re seeing is absurd and illogical,” Baker said.\n\nLong-term financing of school facilities made possible via state bonding not only stresses taxpayers but puts pressure on schools to meet annual financial goals amid continuing uncertainties about enrollment, state certification and the availability of qualified teachers, Baker said.\n\nSuch financing is also routinely used by third-party landlords to leverage private ventures, he said, effectively turning taxpayers into a bank for something other than public education. State officials say taxpayers are not exposed because bondholders assume the risk if the school fails.\n\nBut Baker said that does not factor in the millions in tax dollars spent on annual debt-service payments.\n\n”That money is basically pissed away,” he said. “When the bond is repaid and after taxpayers spend all that money, the public doesn’t own the facility.”\n\nApple faced scrutiny over a real-estate deal involving a charter school from government overseers in New York.\n\nIn a 2013 report, state auditors said there was evidence that a deal between the school’s board and Apple was not at arm's length and the firm stood to make to make a 200 percent profit on leasing the property to the school.\n\nAuditors estimated the company spent $1.9 million to purchase and renovate an old YWCA building and stood to net a return of $4.4 million over the life of a 15-year-lease with the charter. The audit did not identify the corporation by name, but online property records show Apple as the owner at that time.\n\nSchool officials disagreed with the findings, claiming the charter and landlord acted independently and had no relationship before the purchase. Contacted by The Record, an official with Apple declined to comment on the criticism leveled by New York.\n\nA loosely affiliated group of schools started largely by Turkish Americans is a growing player among publicly funded charter schools in New Jersey, with campuses at a dozen locations in the northern part of the state.\n\nBelow is a snapshot, taken from 2014-15, of the schools, showing who goes there, how much money they spend, and how they perform.\n\nAnother affiliated school is under development in Union County.\n\nSource: New Jersey 2014-15 School Performance Reports and the Taxpayers' Guide to Education Spending, except for Hudson, which comes from the school itself.\n\nNOTE: By way of comparison, the statewide pass rate on the grade 4 test was 52 percent in English and 42 percent in math.

Education officials ordered the school one year ago to develop a plan to improve diversity when he approved a renewal of the school’s charter agreement.\n\nBoth the Thomas Edison school and Central Jersey College Prep Charter School, also in Somerset, are the subject of a federal complaint filed this month. The complaint alleges that they discriminate in their enrollment, and that they educate fewer students who are low-income, who have disabilities and who are learning English.\n\nThe Latino Coalition of New Jersey and Franklin C.A.R.E.S., a parent advocacy group, are calling for a federal and state investigation.\n\nBoth schools have denied allegations of discrimination and said the complaint was part of an effort “to harass” and “to shut down” public charter schools.\n\nState test data show schools in Bergen and Somerset counties have performed better than statewide averages, as did middle school students at a charter in Passaic city. Schools in Paterson fell below – but they outperformed their home district.\n\nOne of the schools, the Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology, landed on probation for nearly a year in 2006 and 2007. Its continuing “weak academic performance” was cited by a Standard & Poor’s credit analyst in lowering the overall outlook on debt associated with the school’s facilities.\n\nThe school, which opened in 2003, had previously been investigated by the state and cited for staffing and financial issues, including hiring teachers without proper certification, possible no-show employees, tenure violations and improper payments of immigration fees.\n\nThe ratings agency downgraded the school's bonds in October 2014, citing both financial and academic issues, falling \"far below\" academic standards in some areas.\n\nA second action by the agency, in February 2016, revised the outlook on the bonds from \"stable\" to \"negative.'' A report at the time cited \"weakened\" cash levels that violated the terms of the school's bond agreement with the state and required the hiring of an outside financial consultant.\n\nA school official, responding to questions from The Record, blamed a drop in state aid and one-time expenses associated with opening a new school for the financial weaknesses. The official, Riza Gurcanli, said that the school continues to operate on a \"tight budget,\" and that the overall fund balance for the 2015-16 school year was positive.\n\nCritics claim the schools are part of a nationwide network of at least 100 charter schools that are tied to the Gulen movement.\n\nIn some states, so-called Gulen schools have been investigated for improper bidding practices that steer contracts to Turkish-owned companies, misuse of a visa program to bring teachers from Turkey, and improper use of a federal grant program. Charters in Ohio and Louisiana were raided by the FBI.\n\nThe growing New Jersey network, however, has received kudos from many parents and politicians.\n\nAssemblyman Gordon Johnson, who has visited two of the charter schools at their invitation, said they provide an alternative for families who may seek a small-school environment in a diverse setting.\n\n“It gives kids a chance in a school with different cultures and languages. They learn and respect each other’s customs,” he said.\n\n“If the students coming out of these schools are prepared to go on to the next state in their education, then that is a good service,” he added.\n\nHendrick, the assistant professor of sociology at Loyola University Maryland who wrote a book about the Gulen movement, said some of the schools have been under investigation over their operations and finances. But many of the schools, he said, are thriving.\n\n“For every one under investigation, there are 10 or 20 more that couldn't be more successful,” he said.\n\nTo his supporters, Fethullah Gulen is an enlightened leader – a modern Islamic visionary who champions education, interfaith dialogue and tolerance.\n\nTo the ruling party in his Turkish homeland, Gulen is a dangerous enemy – a traitor they accuse of plotting a failed coup last July and a terrorist whose followers were alleged to have been behind the assassination of a Russian envoy in Turkey late last year.\n\nThe sharply divergent views on the 75-year-old cleric have deeply divided Turkish society. Now they also are stirring tensions with the U.S. as Recep Erdogan, the Turkish president, has pressed for Gulen’s extradition and sharply criticized the Obama administration for failing to honor that request immediately.\n\nAnd the controversy over Gulen’s status could continue to roil American politics with early indications that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to Erdogan’s plea.\n\nTrump spoke with Erdogan by phone last week, but a release by the White House about the call did not mention Gulen, instead saying the two men discussed their shared commitment to fighting terrorism. Trump's CIA director flew to Ankara on Thursday, but Trump officials offered no comment about the visit.\n\nMeanwhile, Gulen, who first came to the U.S. in 1999, has remained holed up at his Poconos estate, rarely seen or heard from in public. For the most part, he has allowed a team of handlers to issue statements in his name in which he steadfastly denies involvement in the coup and any terror attacks.\n\nStill, he remains the influential leader of a social and religious movement — called Hizmet, a Turkish word meaning service — with millions of followers in Turkey and around the world who have built businesses, media outlets and schools, including charter schools in the U.S.\n\nThe coup attempt and Turkey's calls for the U.S. to extradite him have prompted closer scrutiny of the Islamic cleric and his movement, and deepened questions about his ultimate agenda.\n\nGulen insists he seeks social, not political, change – through a modern Muslim movement that promotes peace and enlightenment. But critics say he wants to topple the Turkish government so his followers can take power and convert secular Turkey into an Islamic republic.\n\nThey claim he is using a massive network of institutions, including the U.S. charter schools, to build up power and money to further his agenda and convert students to his way of thinking.\n\nAn investigation by The Record uncovered no direct evidence of Gulen’s involvement in the operation of charter schools in New Jersey. But it did reveal a web of connections among key people involved with the schools, the contractors they hire and established Gulenist groups, while it also raised questions about their use of taxpayer funds and state oversight.\n\nErdogan pushed hard for the Obama administration to hand over Gulen, saying the U.S. must choose between Turkey and FETO, an acronym for what he also calls the \"Gulen Terror Group.\" The Trump administration has not yet made any policy announcements on the issue.\n\n“This new generation of a terrorist organization is indeed a national security threat, not only for Turkey but also for all the 170 countries around the world where it is present,” Erdogan said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 13.\n\nThe U.S. State Department does not classify the organization as terrorist. In fact, Gulenist groups have courted American politicians, taking them on trips to Turkey, inviting them to their events, and contributing to their campaigns.\n\nAcademics who studied the movement said Gulen seeks social change and power; some say it’s by democratic means while others argue it is by less-open methods. But they are dismissive of the terrorist label, saying there was no evidence Gulen or his movement carried out bombings or assassinations.\n\n“It’s certainly not a terrorist organization in a conventional sense,” said Michael Reynolds, an assistant professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton. “In some ways it’s more dangerous because of ways they’ve been able to get inside the Turkish state.”\n\nGulen was embraced in the West after 9/11 as a sort of an antidote to Islamic extremism – a moderate leader who swiftly condemned the attacks, rebuked violence and promoted interfaith dialogue.\n\n“No terrorist can be a Muslim, and no true Muslim can be a terrorist,\" Gulen wrote in a statement published the day after the terrorist attacks. \"Islam demands peace, and the Qur’an demands that every true Muslim be a symbol of peace and work to support the maintenance of basic human rights.”\n\nAmerican authorities say Turkey’s extradition request is under review by federal officials, but the countries are bound by a treaty that requires a thorough, lengthy review with standards of evidence to be met.\n\n\"Under our laws, extradition requests must be assessed by an independent federal court, along with the evidence backing them up,\" said a State Department official, who according to agency policy declined to allow her name to be used. \"It always takes time to work through an extradition request, but we will continue to work closely with the Turkish government as this process moves forward.\"\n\nAllies, then a falling-out\n\nGulen was once an ally of Erdogan's and helped his rise to power, before a falling-out several years ago set the stage for a bitter rivalry.\n\nThe cleric, the son of an imam – a clergyman who presides over services at a mosque – was born in a small village near Turkey’s Erzurum province in 1941. He is said to have been inspired by the work of Said Nursi, a Turkish religious reformer who combined traditional Islamic learning with modern scientific knowledge.\n\nThe charismatic preacher rose to prominence starting in the late 1960s, when, as an imam himself, he captivated congregations with speeches on faith while also urging Turks to embrace capitalism, education and social activism. As he traveled and preached, his teachings gained a global following.\n\nIn Turkey, his followers opened businesses, charities and newspapers while also filling ranks in the military and in law enforcement. They are best known, though, for establishing hundreds of schools, first in Turkey, then across the world, that promote math, science and ethics.\n\nGulen supported Erdogan and his rise as prime minister in 2003, where he served for 11 years before his election as president. Both were devout Muslims who opposed the government-enforced secularism that had prevailed in Turkey. They wanted more religious freedom and a more religious society, said Reynolds, the Princeton historian.\n\nBut they had a falling-out in 2013 when officials linked to Gulen brought corruption charges against people close to Erdogan. A power struggle ensued. Erdogan struck back, dismissing police officials, prosecutors and judges believed to be aligned with Gulen.\n\nGulen had clashed with Turkish authorities before Erdogan was even elected to national office. In 1999, a leaked recording surfaced that was said to show Gulen suggesting that his followers infiltrate state institutions.\n\n\"You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the centers of power,\" Gulen said in the recording. “You must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power, until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey.”\n\nGulen said the quotations were taken out of context, but critics saw them as proof that he had been seeking to take power in Turkey. The year the recording was leaked, and shortly before he was charged with treason, Gulen came to the U.S for medical treatment and stayed, settling in a secluded compound in the Poconos community of Saylorsburg, about 10 miles from the New Jersey state line.\n\nOn July 15, a faction of the Turkish military attempted to topple the government, but failed. The violence left more than 260 people dead and many injured. Gulen has denied allegations that he was behind the coup.\n\n“I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey. Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force,” Gulen wrote in a July statement distributed by the Alliance for Shared Values, a U.S.-based organization that speaks for the movement.\n\nJoshua Hendrick, a sociology professor at Loyola University Maryland who has written about Gulen and his movement, said a coup would go against the goals that Gulenists claim to stand for, including peace and democracy.\n\n“In every which way, it contradicts their collective identity and their publicly stated aims,” said Hendrick, author of \"Gülen: The Ambiguous Politics of Market Islam in Turkey and the World.\"\n\nHendrick said that Turkey’s labeling of Gulen and his network as terrorists was intended to have a political impact.\n\n“To compare the Gulen community with armed insurrectionist groups has no historical precedent,” he said. “There is no noted history of violence within this organization, which is again what makes the events of July 15 so challenging for people such as myself to believe.”\n\nCrackdown on Gulen movement\n\nErdogan clamped down after the failed coup, shutting hundreds of schools, businesses and media organizations in Turkey. Thousands of police officers, soldiers, educators and judges tied to the movement also were arrested or thrown out of their jobs.\n\nThe clampdown extended even to the Gulen-inspired private school in Wayne, the Pioneer Academy, that had 178 international students in the last school year, mostly from Turkey. This year, there are just 60.\n\nTufan Aydin, Pioneer’s principal, said many families could not pay tuition because banks were ordered to stop payments to Gulen institutions. Others could not afford it because they or their families had their livelihoods cut short during an attempt by Erdogan, the Turkish president, to purge Gulenists from power and shut down their businesses.\n\n“Parents, they don’t want to have the pressure of sending kids to schools targeted by the prime minister or president,” Aydin said, adding that the schools’ website can no longer be accessed in Turkey.\n\nLast year, the Turkish government hired the London-based law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the global activities of the Gulen movement, including operations of alleged Gulen-linked charter schools in the U.S. Attorney Robert Amsterdam has claimed that the tax dollars that go to support the public schools are being used to raise funds for Gulen and the movement and to employ his followers.\n\nLeaders in those charters schools have said they are secular institutions, with no ties to Gulen and his movement, although some have said they themselves are inspired by the Gulenist commitment to modern education.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey in December, Erdogan alleged that the shooter – an off-duty police officer who said he was angry over Russian intervention in Syria – was linked to Gulen.\n\nA statement released by the Pennsylvania-based cleric said the shooting, which took place at an Ankara art gallery and was captured in a series of jarring photographs, had nothing to do with him or his movement. Rather, Gulen's supporters said, Erdogan was trying to divert attention from security lapses caused by his firing and imprisoning police and counter-terrorism officers for alleged connections to Gulen.\n\n\"While the assertion is wrong and irresponsible, it is not unexpected since Mr. Erdogan blames Mr. Gulen for any and all harm that besets Turkey,\" according to the statement released by the Alliance for Shared Values.\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden visited Ankara, the capital of Turkey, in August, Erdogan urged him to take swift action to hand over Gulen.\n\n\"In light of this extradition treaty, those individuals should be taken into pretrial detention, they should be arrested, and throughout the trial they need to remain in custody,\" Erdogan said, speaking about Gulen. \"This person, however, is currently managing and directing the terrorist organization where he lives\" in Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden responded by touting the U.S. democratic system.\n\n\"What possible motive could we have to, in fact, harbor a terrorist? Why would we do that?\" Biden said. \"It makes absolutely no sense. None whatsoever. We are bound by the law. The president is bound by the law. The court will decide.\"\n\nGulen supporters are concerned with what may happen with the change in administrations in Washington. Trump himself has not talked about Gulen, but in an op-ed piece that retired Gen. Michael Flynn wrote for the congressional newspaper The Hill in November, the ousted national security adviser said the U.S. should not offer Gulen \"a safe haven,\" and likened him to Ayatollah Khomeini, the radical cleric who was the leader of Iran’s Islamic revolution a generation ago.\n\nFlynn also called for the U.S. to strengthen its relationship with Turkey, which he described as “our strongest ally against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as well as a source of stability in the region.”\n\nHendrick, of Loyola University Maryland, said it was too soon to say whether Trump will seek warmer relations with Turkey, because many factors complicate the relationship.\n\nA law firm representing Gulen said in a statement that it hoped Flynn's op-ed was not a policy statement for Trump.\n\n“The extradition process is a serious one, governed by treaty with Turkey that is clear about the steps that need to be taken in such cases. It should not be a political matter,\" lawyers from the Washington, D.C.-based Steptoe & Johnson LLP said in a statement.\n\nFethullah Gulen quotes from his statements and writings:\n\n“Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. I pray to God for Turkey, for Turkish citizens, and for all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.”\n\n– July 15, 2016 statement about Turkey coup attempt\n\n“At a time when Western democracies are searching for moderate Muslim voices, I and my friends in the Hizmet movement have taken a clear stance against extremist violence, from the Sept. 11 attacks by Al Qaeda to brutal executions by the Islamic State to the kidnappings by Boko Haram.”\n\n— July 25, 2016 op-ed in the New York Times\n\n\"You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the centers of power. You must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power, until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey.”\n\n– Leaked sermon that aired in 1999 on Turkish television\n\n“With the endeavors of valued people, like yourselves, who have come together to establish a happy world built on universal values and to set up ‘peace islands’ of the future, I hope that this movement will spread and will carry us to the horizon where cultures and civilizations meet and reach a consensus.”\n\n– Message to Gulen followers at a conference on Nov. 11, 2005\n\n“All acts of terrorism are major blows dealt to peace and serenity. No matter what the motive behind it is, an act of terror can by no means be accepted or approved of. Major acts of terror in past years have not only impacted the geography where they were carried out, but have also damaged world peace.”\n\n– Jan. 29, 2011 statement after an attack at an airport in Moscow\n\nThis story was born in the wake of dramatic events last summer occurring half a world away from North Jersey. The Turkish government accused a 75-year-old Islamic cleric living in the Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains of fomenting a brief and bloody rebellion in his native land. The same man, Fethullah Gulen, they’ve long alleged was behind a network of taxpayer-funded charters schools in America.\n\nIn the wake of the failed coup, veteran investigative reporters Jean Rimbach, Jeff Pillets and Hannan Adely were asked to look into a group of taxpayer-funded charter schools in North Jersey that arose from the region’s Turkish community.\n\nThe assignment took The Record team into the murky world of global geo-politics, where the Ankara government’s stark accusations were met with firm denials from Gulen and his followers. But it also led the team's members to the more familiar turf of public education in New Jersey, where what they found had more immediate implications for our readers, raising questions about oversight of the schools and how tax dollars are being spent.\n\nOur reporting team interviewed people involved with the charter schools and Gulenist groups, education experts and the legal representative for the Turkish government, among others, for this story. The team reviewed tax forms, property records, and paperwork on file with the state’s Department of Education and Economic Development Authority, in addition to other sources.\n\nRimbach is an award-winning investigative reporter at The Record. She has covered an array of topics during her time, including criminal justice, child welfare and education.\n\nPillets has honed his skills as a keen government watchdog over a 20-year career, reporting on a variety of topics. Among the numerous honors he has won, he was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize about corruption in a failed development in the Meadowlands known as EnCap.\n\nAdely has been a reporter at The Record for six years and currently covers Muslim and Arab communities in New Jersey, as well as state education news.

And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about.\n\nDonald Trump supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.\n\nThey have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a “protest” against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nThey have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as “political prisoners.”\n\nHere is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were completely unarmed\n\nTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.\n\nIn a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a “completely unarmed protest.” Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, “One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don’t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed – and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far “over 75” people charged in connection to the attack “have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.”\n\nWe may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.\n\nMark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, “you’d be here for another reason.”\n\nGuy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt “specifically targeted at least two lawmakers – the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell – whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.” And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were merely protesting a ‘rigged’ election\n\nTrump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a “wild” protest against President Joe Biden’s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to “fight like hell.”\n\nAfter the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months – and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the “real insurrection” was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a “day of protesting.” (He also made similar claims later in the year.)\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn’t rigged and wasn’t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden’s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 – in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted – involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\n\n“This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: “The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.”\n\nLie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police\n\nA common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nTrump said in a book interview in March that “the Capitol Police were ushering people in” and “the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.” The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack “were invited in by Capitol Police.”\n\nFacts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.\n\nRioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThere are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building.\n\nSince we don’t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it’s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal “conduct unbecoming” that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations.\n\nBut no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it’s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: “The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.”\n\nLie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners\n\nOne of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become “political prisoners” while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.\n\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement “are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals” but are “political prisoners who are now being persecuted”; he suggested that there are “nearly 200” nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September’s “Justice for J6” rally said its event was meant “to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.”\n\nFacts First: This “political prisoners” narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups.\n\nIt’s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it’s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden’s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.\n\nA few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\n\nLie: January 6 was a false flag attack\n\nBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame – claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence.\n\nSuch “false flag” theories – that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump’s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad – never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.” Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): “It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.”\n\nAnd Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, “You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.”\n\nFacts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to “fight like hell” and to march to the Capitol. The rioters’ allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews.\n\nThough there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters – and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.\n\nCarlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI – The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant – the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated “false flag” operation.\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by “deep state” liberals trying to set up Trump supporters.\n\n“It’s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example. It’s un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies,” Cheney said.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Marshall Cohen", "Daniel Dale", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/politics/donald-trump-capitol-riot-pardons-2024-republicans/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump offers chilling glimpse into possible second ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump conjured a vision of a second term that would function as a tool of personal vengeance, and become even more authoritarian than his first, when he vowed to pardon US Capitol insurrectionists if he runs for the White House again and wins.\n\nHis pledge at a Texas rally Saturday was accompanied by a call for demonstrations if prosecutors in New York, who are probing Trump’s business practices, and those in Georgia, looking into his attempts to reverse his election loss in the state, do anything that he defined as wrong or illegal. The comments underscore Trump’s obsession with delusional lies that he won the 2020 election, and his determination to put that falsehood at the core of the Republican worldview. As was often the case during his four years in office, Trump’s pardons threat shows that he still makes no distinction between his personal goals and the national interest or rule of law.\n\nBut the former President’s new rhetorical outburst also at times hinted at concern with his own legal position, and comes at a moment when various criminal and congressional lines of investigation seem to be tightening around him. The House select committee probing the January 6, 2021, riot has now penetrated deep inside Trump’s West Wing inner circle, and he lost a Supreme Court bid to keep key documents secret. The likelihood of a damning accounting from the committee, bristling with new details about Trump’s attempt to destroy American democracy, is growing, though the GOP has sought to thwart it at every turn.\n\nAs well as further threatening US democracy on Saturday night, Trump was preoccupied with his personal legal exposure. He fired off a wild attack, which looked to be racially-motivated, on two Black New York prosecutors investigating whether his business empire deliberately falsified accounts to get preferential treatment on loans and income taxes. He also alluded to potential legal peril he’s facing in Fulton County, Georgia, where a Black district attorney has been granted a special grand jury to examine his attempt to steal President Joe Biden’s win in the state.\n\nIn a sign of the potential impact of Trump’s incitement, District Attorney Fani Willis wrote to the FBI on Sunday asking for an immediate risk assessment for the Fulton County Courthouse and government buildings. She said that “security concerns were escalated this weekend” by the former President’s speech and added that her office had already received “communications” from people unhappy with the investigation before Trump’s rally.\n\nTrump’s pressure on investigators prompted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who sits on the House committee probing the insurrection, to warn that the ex-President had issued a “call to arms.”\n\n“Calling out for demonstrations if, you know, anything adverse, legally, happens to him, is pretty extraordinary. And I think it’s important to think through what message is being sent,” the California Democrat told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Sunday.\n\nIn yet another sign of Trump’s incessantly consuming inability to accept his election loss, he issued a statement that same evening slamming former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing his demands to overturn the result of the democratic election in 2020, and falsely claimed that the then-vice president had the power to do so.\n\nWith Trump and his fans already referring to him as the 45th and the 47th President, his fixation with the 2020 election may also represent a growing problem for the Republican Party. In the midterm elections in November and beyond, the GOP wants to build a case that Biden is weak, flailing at home and abroad and has lost his grip on inflation. But Trump, who wants to use the elections to demonstrate his hold on the GOP grassroots, threatens to detract from that simple Republican message. While the ex-President remains wildly popular with the “Make America Great Again” crowd, his loss in 2020 poses the question of whether Republicans – and independents and suburban swing voters – want to get stuck forever in Trump’s unhinged 2020 feedback loop. Some other potential 2024 presidential candidates, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are meanwhile demonstrating that Trump’s populist nationalism and assault on what supporters view as liberal elites will be waged long after the 45th President has left the scene.\n\nDemocrats failed in their attempt to make Trump the bogeyman in last year’s Virginia gubernatorial election, when Republican Glenn Youngkin kept his distance from the ex-President and tapped into voter concerns about education, Covid exhaustion and rising prices. But it will be an easier case for Democrats to make when Trump is holding wild rallies in swing states and again makes himself the face of the party in 2022, spreading his lies, spewing increasingly racist rhetoric and behaving like an autocrat in waiting.\n\nTrump signals possible new abuse of power\n\nTrump’s latest comment on pardons was in line with his attempt to whitewash the truth of a day when his mob, incited at his Washington rally, invaded the Capitol to try and disrupt the certification of Biden’s win, beat up police officers and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Throughout his presidency, he used the chief executive’s pardon power to shield his political cronies.\n\n“If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,” Trump said on Saturday. “And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.”\n\nPeople dragged into the criminal justice system because they tried to stage a coup based on lies about a stolen election are not being treated unfairly. But it is characteristic of Trump’s democracy-threatening brand of politics to play up a sense of grievance and victimhood. He spent four years of his twice-impeached presidency sowing a narrative that opponents and subordinates who tried to check him were in fact the ones guilty of abusing power. And he repeatedly sought to force the Justice Department to embrace his anti-constitutional schemes.\n\nSeveral high-profile Republicans quickly dismissed Trump’s offer to help January 6 insurrectionists. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who disappointed the national party by passing on a Senate bid, said on Sunday that those responsible for the insurrection must be held accountable. Asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” about the possibility of a pardon for such Trump supporters, Sununu, who is emerging as a standard bearer for a possible post-Trump GOP, said: “Of course not. Oh my goodness, no.”\n\nOne of Trump’s closest enablers, Sen. Lindsey Graham, also dismissed Trump’s promise in an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I think it’s inappropriate. I don’t want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was okay. I don’t want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,” the South Carolina Republican said. His comments were notable since he has previously warned that the GOP needs to find a way to work with Trump if it wants to wield power. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also condemned Trump’s remarks. “I do not think … President Trump should have made that pledge to do pardons. We should let the judicial process proceed. January 6 was a dark day in our history,” said Collins, who just won reelection in 2020, speaking on ABC’s “This Week.” She also said it was “very unlikely” that she would support Trump if he does officially decide on a third presidential run.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the party’s most vocal critics of Trump and his hold on the Republican Party, tweeted Monday that “Trump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he’d pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. He’d do it all again if given the chance.”\n\nThis must have been a case of déjà vu for Republicans who often had their talking points overshadowed by the ex-President’s extremism when he was in power. But it is one thing for key Republicans to criticize the ex-President now. On every previous occasion when the GOP faced a choice between appeasing Trump to keep or win power and standing up for American democracy and the rule of law, it has chosen the first option. In a sense, Trump’s demagoguery this weekend was a fresh sign that he is convinced that his personality cult still holds his party in thrall.\n\nThe House Republican conference has already demonstrated that it would act as a vessel of Trump’s power and vengeance if it wins the majority in November. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has put the ex-President at the center of his efforts to become speaker of the House and has been put on notice by pro-Trump members like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that departures from the ex-President’s dogma could doom his hopes. And former Speaker Newt Gingrich encapsulated the extremism of the House GOP when he suggested last week that a new majority should throw members of the January 6 committee in jail.\n\nTrump fires off racist attack on New York prosecutors\n\nThe ex-President’s speech was also notable for an extraordinary assault on prosecutors in New York who are investigating allegations of fraud at his business empire. The ex-President called for “the biggest protests we have ever had” if the prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal.” New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. are both leading investigations into Trump’s business empire. And both are Black, a point that Trump hinted at in his complaints about his treatment.\n\n“These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They’re racists and they’re very sick – they’re mentally sick,” he said. “They’re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you,” he told his crowd.\n\nIt was the second recent occasion when Trump has sought to stir up racial hatred as part of his increasingly dangerous rhetoric. He claimed at a rally in Arizona two weeks ago that White people could not get Covid-19 treatment or vaccines in New York, grossly distorting a policy that says that race should be one factor in the use of limited therapies for a disease that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic populations.\n\nTrump’s speech once again presented a conundrum about how much attention should be paid to an ex-President who is using his high profile to stir division and outrage in order to stay politically relevant. Yet given his power in the Republican Party and the intensity of those who follow a once and possible future President who has already incited a coup to overthrow an election, it would be unwise to ignore the implications of his rage.\n\nEven out of office, Trump has convinced millions of Americans that the election was stolen and Biden is an illegitimate president. Multiple Republican-run states have passed laws that make it harder to vote and easier for political officials to interfere in election results rooted in his false claims of voter fraud. And Trump is touring the country inciting polarization and racial animus as the hot favorite for the GOP 2024 nomination.\n\nJohn Dean, a former White House counsel to President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, condemned Trump’s remarks on pardons in a chilling tweet.\n\n“This is beyond being a demagogue to the stuff of dictators. He is defying the rule of law. Failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behavior,” Dean wrote. “If thinking Americans don’t understand what Trump is doing and what the criminal justice system must do we are all in big trouble!”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/01/04/fact-check-roundup-many-false-narratives-jan-6-insurrection/9052900002/", "title": "Fact check roundup: Debunking false narratives about the Jan. 6 ...", "text": "It has been two years since a mob supporting former President Donald Trump – fueled by baseless voter fraud claims – violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe attack led to deaths, injuries and hundreds of arrests, and it temporarily halted Congress' certification of President Joe Biden’s Electoral College win.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said over the weekend that if she had led the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that “we would have won” and that people would have been “armed.”\n\n“I come to Washington, I swear in on January 3, I get accused of giving insurrection tours which I thought was hilarious because I couldn’t even find the bathroom in the Capitol. True story,” Greene, a Georgia Republican, said while speaking at an event by the New York Young Republican Club, according to video posted by the Twitter user @patriottakes. “Then January 6 happens, and next thing you know, I organized the whole thing along with Steve Bannon here. And I gotta tell you something: If Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, it would have been armed. Yeah. See, that’s the whole joke isn’t it?”\n\nGreene continued, “They say that whole thing was planned and I’m like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ A bunch of conservatives, Second Amendment supporters went in the Capitol without guns and they think we organized that? I don’t think so.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Monday, Greene said she was being sarcastic and, as she has done previously, denied any involvement in the January 6 riot.\n\n“My comments were making fun of Joe Biden and the Democrats, who have continuously made me a political target since January 6th,” she said.\n\nGreene, whose public image has been built largely on her willingness to make inflammatory statements and embrace fringe conspiracy theories, has previously tried to justify the deadly insurrection and downplayed it as “just a riot.” But many rioters who were at the US Capitol that day carried weapons such as bats and poles, and several carried guns, including one rioter who had two loaded handguns and was sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nGreene’s latest comments are also notable given the prospect that she will return to committee assignments in the Republican-controlled House next year, and former President Donald Trump’s determination to make the ideologies behind the Capitol riot a central theme of his new presidential campaign.\n\nBut although she has tried to publicly downplay the deadly insurrection, text messages from her to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows obtained by CNN that were handed over to the January 6 committee show her pleading for Trump to stop the violence that day.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol[.] Please tell the President to calm people[.] This isn’t the way to solve anything,” she texted.\n\nThe White House on Monday condemned Greene’s comments, calling it “violent rhetoric” and a “slap in the face” to law enforcement and families who lost loved ones defending the US Capitol that day.\n\n“It goes against our fundamental values as a country for a Member of Congress to wish that the carnage of January 6th had been even worse, and to boast that she would have succeeded in an armed insurrection against the United States government,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}]}

How these cases play out with other defendants\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSo far, that inquiry has included congressional testimony last week from two former Internal Revenue Service officials that investigated Hunter Biden. The investigators detailed to members of Congress how they felt authorities within the Department of Justice improperly interfered with their investigation and gave Hunter Biden preferential treatment.\n\nWeiss has refuted the allegations in a letter to lawmakers, according to reporting by the Associated Press.\n\nUSA TODAY Coverage: Hunter Biden goes to court as fight continues between GOP and White House\n\nWhat happened Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, the eve of the hearing in Hunter Biden's criminal case, a top Republican lawmaker sought to interject the IRS investigators' testimony into the judge's consideration over whether to accept Hunter Biden's plea deal.\n\nThe filing was submitted on behalf of U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican who chairs a congressional committee that hosted testimony from the IRS investigators last week.\n\nThe brief states that Hunter Biden \"appears to have benefited from political interference which calls into question the propriety of the investigation of the U.S. Attorney’s Office\" and that the court should consider the investigators' testimony when evaluating whether to accept the plea deal.\n\nPresiding Judge Maryellen Noreika will discuss the plea deal with Hunter Biden and prosecutors during the hearing, but it is rare for a judge to reject a negotiated plea agreement. In the letter, Theodore Kittila, a Wilmington, Delaware attorney representing Smith, excerpted portions of the IRS investigators' testimony and made a legal argument that Noreika can reject the plea deal.\n\nAlong with the brief, Kittila submitted to the court hundreds of pages of documents as exhibits that include the IRS investigators' testimony and other information gathered by congressional investigators.\n\nWhy are sanctions being discussed?\n\nThe last minute intervention by Smith led to a separate late-night drama involving claims that Hunter Biden's legal team lied to court officials to remove exhibits involving Hunter Biden's finances that were submitted by the attorney representing Smith.\n\nThe exhibits were posted Tuesday morning alongside the legal brief on a publicly-available docket for Hunter Biden's criminal case.\n\nShortly after, Hunter Biden's attorneys complained to Smith's attorneys that the filing contained sensitive information that violated court rules and demanded the documents be refiled, but sealed from public view. Smith's attorneys rejected this argument, stating the exhibits contained material that was already publicly available through relevant congressional committees, according to emails posted in court documents.\n\nThen, at some point Tuesday, an attorney employed by a firm that is part of Hunter Biden's legal team called the court and represented that she worked with Kittila, the attorney representing Smith, and requested the exhibits be taken down, according to a narrative of events outlined by Noreika on the court's docket.\n\nINVESTIGATION:How Hunter Biden played hand in bringing business to University of Delaware's STAR Campus\n\nThe documents were then taken down from public view.

Salerno, an attorney that is part of Hunter Biden's legal team, wrote to the court that another attorney from his office was responsible for the phone call, that the attorney in question properly identified themselves and the situation \"stems from an unfortunate and unintentional miscommunication between a staff member at our firm and employees of the court.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the issue will be addressed during Hunter Biden's hearing Wednesday morning.\n\nYET TO COME:Hunter Biden to appear in Delaware federal court Wednesday.

I love him' 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Washington have said that when they take over leadership of House committees they plan to conduct aggressive investigations of the Biden administration. That includes probes related to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, of Covid origins, and what they say were social media censorship of conservative views on Covid public-health restrictions.\n\nThose investigations likely are still months away from inception, and they likely face hurdles including executive privilege claims that would restrict access to internal White House documents.\n\nDoughty, however, does not have those restraints. His rulings to date in the alleged censorship lawsuit have opened the way for Republican officials to obtain Biden administration documents and even videotaped depositions of government officials.\n\nRepublicans in Washington and elsewhere have pursued claims that government officials were behind moves by social media companies to restrict discussion of Hunter Biden-related stories before the 2020 election. They cite the episode as one of several examples of “censorship” of conservative views by the private companies, which legally have a right to control content on their platforms.\n\nThe lawsuit by the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general represents a novel way to pursue those censorship claims by accusing the Biden administration of effectively censoring conservatives by leaning on the private social media companies. It also represents a way for Republicans to effectively practice oversight of the federal administration from outside Washington.\n\nThey’ve found a ready ear in Doughty. He has been open to Republican arguments that the FBI, under the Trump administration, effectively censored discussion of stories published by the New York Post about a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. The FBI and US intelligence officials had warned earlier that year that Russia and other countries were seeking to use disinformation to influence the US election.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in an August interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, appeared to link warnings from the FBI to Facebook’s decision to limit sharing of the New York Post article for several days while the company’s fact checker tried to assess it. In response, dozens of Republican lawmakers wrote Meta seeking communications about the Hunter Biden laptop.\n\nDoughty ordered the deposition of Elvis Chan, a San Francisco-based FBI assistant agent in charge for cybersecurity, even after Meta lawyers wrote to the Missouri solicitor general saying: “Mr. Chan at no point in time advised Meta to ‘suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story.’ Nor did any of his colleagues.”\n\nThe judge, in his ruling, said that “even if Chan played no role in the Hunter Biden laptop communication issue, he may have knowledge of who did and his deposition is nonetheless warranted.”\n\nThe FBI didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department and Fauci did not comment.\n\nDoughty has previously gained attention with rulings that blocked a Biden administration vaccine mandate and overturning a ban on federal oil and gas leases.\n\nJustice officials face tough odds to try to block Doughty’s orders, in part because their appeals would go the conservative-dominated 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which repeatedly has paved the way for Republican initiatives, including the Texas law that effectively banned abortion before the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights under Roe v. Wade.\n\nFacing those odds, the Justice Department is seeking block the public release of the video depositions ordered by Doughty. Government lawyers raised concerns about the privacy and safety of government officials, citing threats that Fauci has received threats over his role in nation’s Covid response. In August, a West Virginia man was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison for sending threatening messages to Fauci, including one saying Fauci and his family would be “dragged into the street, beaten to death, and set on fire.”\n\n“Civil servants do not volunteer to become public figures when they join the federal ranks; they do not expect to be dragged into the spotlight as a result of litigation,” the Justice Department argued in a court filing last week. “And, more specifically, they do not reasonably expect that they will be subjected to video-recorded, publicly disseminated cross-examination about the way that they carried out their job duties.”", "authors": ["Evan Perez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/21/fact-check-joe-biden-leveraged-ukraine-aid-oust-corrupt-prosecutor/5991434002/", "title": "Fact check: Joe Biden leveraged Ukraine aid to oust corrupt ...", "text": "The claim: Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine to assist his son, Hunter Biden\n\nWhile former Vice President Joe Biden oversaw foreign policy in Ukraine, his son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings, the largest gas company in the fledgling democracy.\n\nDespite a recently concluded investigation by Senate Republicans that found no wrongdoing by the Bidens, claims to the contrary have continued to circulate on social media.\n\n\"VP Biden threatened to withhold 1 billion dollars from Ukraine to save his son's job,\" reads a meme posted to Facebook by Secure America Now.

It was because Shokin wasn't pursuing corruption among the country's politicians.\n\nAs European and American diplomats pressed Ukraine to clean up its corruption, they focused on Shokin's leadership of the Prosecutor General's Office, which he took over in February 2015.\n\nMike Carpenter, who served as a foreign policy adviser to the then-vice president, told USA TODAY that Shokin \"never went after any corrupt individuals at all\" and \"never prosecuted any high-profile cases of corruption.\"\n\nFact check:Claims that Hunter Biden received $3.5M from Russia are unproven, lack context\n\nCharlie Kupchan, who was a special assistant to President Barack Obama and a senior director for European Affairs on the National Security Council, said anti-corruption efforts were \"a big part of our diplomacy\" with Ukraine, since \"it was that corruption that allowed Russia to manipulate the country politically and economically.\"\n\nAs a result, Biden leveraged $1 billion in aid as \"a stick to move Ukraine forward,\" Kupchan said. \"He was acting alongside our European allies. Everybody was of a single mind that this prosecutor was not the right guy for the job.\"\n\nDaria Kaleniuk, the co-founder and executive director of the Anti Corruption Action Centre in Kyiv, Ukraine, credited Biden, the International Monetary Fund — which threatened to delay $40 billion in aid for similar reasons — and others with the prosecutor's removal.\n\n\"Civil society organizations in Ukraine were pressing for his resignation,\" Kaleniuk said, \"but no one would have cared if there had not been voices from outside this country calling on him to go.\"\n\nAfter Shokin left the Prosecutor General's Office, Jan Tombinski, the ambassador from the European Union to Ukraine, called it \"an opportunity to make a fresh start.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" Tombinski said, \"that the new Prosecutor General will ensure that the Office of the Prosecutor General becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.\"\n\nFact check:Joe Biden never said he would have prevented all COVID-19 deaths\n\nProsecutor was not investigating Burisma at the time Joe Biden called for his removal\n\nBurisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden called for Shokin to be removed, per the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency that has worked closely with the FBI.\n\nIn 2014, Shokin had investigated Burisma for money laundering and tax irregularities, per USA TODAY.\n\nThe probe focused on 2010-12, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau.\n\nHunter Biden — who joined the board in 2014 and served on it until early 2019 — was not the subject of the investigation.\n\nMore:GOP-led Senate committees: Hunter Biden work in Ukraine a conflict of interest, impact 'unclear'\n\nThe case was settled in court in 2017.\n\nThe recent report by Senate Republicans also contained no evidence that Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor as a way to protect his son, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, also said any suggestion of impropriety is false.\n\n“Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing,” Bates told USA TODAY.\n\nFact check:In 1973, Biden said 'the two-party system' was 'good for the negro'\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, the claim that Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine to save his son's job is FALSE.

No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/tech/musk-twitter-hunter-biden/index.html", "title": "Hunter Biden: Released Twitter emails show how employees ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor days, Twitter owner Elon Musk had teased a massive bombshell disclosure based on internal company documents that he claimed would reveal “what really happened” inside Twitter when it decided to temporarily suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden and his laptop.\n\nBut on Friday, instead of releasing a trove of documents to the public, Musk’s big reveal pointed to a series of tweets by the journalist Matt Taibbi, who had been provided with emails that largely corroborated what was already known about the incident.\n\nAttracting thousands of retweets, Taibbi’s winding tweet thread reaffirmed how, in the initial hours after the Post story went live, Twitter employees grappled with fears that it could have been the result of a Russian hacking operation.\n\nIt showed employees on Twitter’s legal, policy and communications teams debating – and at times disagreeing – over whether to restrict the article under the company’s hacked materials policy, weeks before the 2020 election, where Joe Biden, Hunter Biden’s father, ran against then-President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile some questioned the basis for the decision and warned that Twitter would be inviting allegations of anti-conservative bias, others within the company, including senior officials, said the circumstances surrounding the Post story were unclear and recommended caution, according to screenshots of internal communications shared by Taibbi.\n\n(Then-CEO Jack Dorsey – whom Taibbi said was not involved in the decision – has told US lawmakers that in hindsight, suppressing the story was a mistake.)\n\nThe emails Taibbi obtained are consistent with what former Twitter site integrity head Yoel Roth told journalist Kara Swisher in an onstage interview earlier this week. During that interview, Roth said he felt at the time that the Post reporting bore the hallmarks of a Russian hack-and-leak operation, an assessment that was shared at the time by dozens of former US intelligence officials. Roth did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThe Taibbi posts undercut a top claim by Musk and Republicans, who have accused the FBI of leaning on social media companies to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop stories.\n\nMusk tweeted Friday night, amid the Taibbi posts, that Twitter had acted “under orders from the government.”\n\nTaibbi said in his series of tweets that “there is no evidence - that I’ve seen - of any government involvement in the laptop story.”\n\nLawyers for Facebook parent company Meta have made similar comments in recent weeks, disputing claims from Republicans that the FBI coerced Facebook to suppress the laptop stories.\n\nTaibbi said the material he reviewed referenced general FBI warnings about potential attempted Russian interference in the elections, which also dovetails with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s public account of Facebook’s handling of the New York Post story and affirms how Twitter was on high alert for possible foreign meddling.\n\nIn the wake of the article’s suppression, Taibbi said one Democratic congressman, California Rep. Ro Khanna, wrote to Twitter’s chief legal officer suggesting it was a bad look and a departure from First Amendment ideals to suppress a news report containing details that affect a presidential candidate. Khanna noted in the email he was saying this even though he was a “total Biden partisan.” Khanna did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tweet thread also highlighted how officials from both political parties routinely wrote to Twitter asking for specific tweets to be removed. Taibbi included a screenshot of an email from the “Biden team” asking to delete tweets. A CNN review of those tweets on an archive site showed some purported photos of Hunter Biden, including nudity, that may have violated Twitter policy.\n\nTaibbi said the contact from political parties happened more frequently from Democrats, but provided no internal documents to back up his assertion. He also did not say that Democrats requested that Twitter suppress the Post story, and his account did not suggest that the US government had ever pressured Twitter to suppress the story.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/03/what-really-happened-when-biden-forced-out-ukraines-top-prosecutor/3785620002/", "title": "What really happened when Biden forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor", "text": "WASHINGTON – A whistleblower complaint centering on President Donald Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president has spurred a number of allegations and counterallegations as Republicans and Democrats jockey for position amid an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt the heart of Congress' probe into the president's actions is his claim that former Vice President and 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nBut sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate in Ukraine say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim.\n\nIt wasn't because Shokin was investigating a natural gas company tied to Biden's son; it was because Shokin wasn't pursuing corruption among the country's politicians, according to a Ukrainian official and four former American officials who specialized in Ukraine and Europe.\n\nShokin's inaction prompted international calls for his ouster and ultimately resulted in his removal by Ukraine's parliament.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWithout pressure from Joe Biden, European diplomats, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations, Shokin would not have been fired, said Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder and executive director of the Anti Corruption Action Centre in Kiev.\n\n\"Civil society organizations in Ukraine were pressing for his resignation,\" Kaleniuk said, \"but no one would have cared if there had not been voices from outside this country calling on him to go.\"\n\nIn a July phone call, Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden's actions. That prompted a whistleblower to accuse Trump of asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, which is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's assertion contradicted\n\nThe actions at the center of Trump's allegation occurred in late 2015 and early 2016, when U.S. aid was critical to Ukraine. Russia had seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and was supporting separatists who were fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.\n\nBiden took an interest in Ukraine, said Steven Pifer, a William J. Perry fellow at Stanford University and former ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"You saw the vice president begin to emerge as really sort of the senior policy lead on Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"It's good to have attention at that level.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to pressure the government to remove Shokin from the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claim Biden did this to quash Shokin's investigation into Ukraine's largest gas company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner, oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nThey say this benefited Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board of directors – for which he was paid $50,000 a month.\n\nTheir assertion is contradicted by former diplomatic officials who were following the issue at the time.\n\nBurisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden called for Shokin's ouster, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency set up in 2014 that has worked closely with the FBI.\n\nShokin's office had investigated Burisma, but the probe focused on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to the anti-corruption bureau.\n\nThe investigation dealt with the Ministry of Ecology, which allegedly granted special permits to Burisma between 2010 and 2012, the agency said. Hunter Biden did not join the company until 2014.\n\nRead it yourself: The full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint\n\nCritics of Hunter Biden have questioned how he landed such a lucrative role with no experience in Ukraine or the gas industry.\n\nBut it's not unusual for Ukrainian companies to bring on high-profile people from the West in an effort to burnish their image and gain influence, Pifer said.\n\nCofer Black, who served as Bush's CIA counterterrorism chief, joined Burisma's board in 2017.\n\nThere is no evidence Hunter Biden did anything wrong, said Yuri Lutsenko, the prosecutor general who succeeded Shokin.\n\nHowever, Lutsenko, who's also faced criticism for his actions as prosecutor, supported Trump's claim before changing his story. He resigned as prosecutor in August.\n\nThe Burisma investigation ended with a settlement and a fine paid by one of the firm's accountants, according to Sergii Leshchenko, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who spearheaded anti-corruption efforts under former President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nHow Biden leveraged U.S. aid to oust prosecutor\n\nIn the wake of the 2014 ouster of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, European and U.S. officials stepped up their efforts to deal with corruption in Ukraine.\n\n\"A big part of our diplomacy was pushing the Ukrainian government to clean up the corruption, partly because it was that corruption that allowed Russia to manipulate the country politically and economically,\" said Charlie Kupchan, who served as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and a senior director for European Affairs on the National Security Council.\n\nBiden used U.S. aid as \"a stick to move Ukraine forward,\" Kupchan said. \"He was acting alongside our European allies. Everybody was of a single mind that this prosecutor was not the right guy for the job.\"\n\nBiden has boasted about his role in getting Shokin fired. During a 2018 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, he said he withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine in order to force the government to address the problem with its top prosecutor.\n\n\"I looked at them and said: 'I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\" he said.\n\nPifer, who also oversaw diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine under President George W. Bush, said it was appropriate for Biden to use U.S. aid as leverage. He said he used similar methods to pressure Ukraine.\n\nEven without any credible evidence that Joe Biden sought to benefit his son, Pifer said Hunter Biden showed poor judgment in getting involved with Ukraine.\n\n\"At that point, it was pretty clear that his father was already the lead American policy person on Ukraine,\" he said. \"And even if there's no conflict of interest, I think that he should have been more mindful of how that appears.\"\n\nInternational effort to fight corruption in Ukraine\n\nThe international effort to remove Shokin, who became prosecutor general in February 2015, began months before Biden stepped into the spotlight, said Mike Carpenter, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Biden and a deputy assistant secretary of defense, with a focus on Ukraine, Russia, Eurasia, the Balkans, and conventional arms control.\n\nAs European and U.S. officials pressed Ukraine to clean up Ukraine's corruption, they focused on Shokin's leadership of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\n\"Shokin played the role of protecting the vested interest in the Ukrainian system,\" said Carpenter, who traveled with Biden to Ukraine in 2015. \"He never went after any corrupt individuals at all, never prosecuted any high-profile cases of corruption.\"\n\nThat demonstrated that Poroshenko's administration was not sincere about tackling corruption and building strong, independent law enforcement agencies, said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank.\n\nIn July 2015, Shokin's office became mired in scandal after authorities raided homes belonging to two high-ranking prosecutors. Police seized millions of dollars worth of diamonds and cash, suggesting the pair had been taking bribes.\n\nIt became known as the \"diamond prosecutors\" case. Deputy General Prosecutor Vitaliy Kasko, who said he tried to investigate it, resigned months later, calling the prosecutor's office a \"hotbed of corruption\" and an \"instrument of political pressure.\"\n\nShokin's office also stepped in to help Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma.\n\nBritish authorities had frozen $23 million in a money-laundering probe, but Shokin's office failed to send documents British authorities needed to prosecute Zlochevsky. The case eventually unraveled and the assets were unfrozen.\n\nIn October 2015, Ukrainians staged a protest outside Poroshenko's home calling for Shokin's removal.\n\nPressure mounts to remove Shokin\n\nIn late 2015, U.S. officials stepped up the pressure.\n\nDuring a September 2015 speech at a financial forum in Odessa, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt decried the inability of Shokin's office to root out corruption.\n\nBiden and Ukraine: Will Trump's efforts to discredit the former VP hurt him?\n\n\"Rather than supporting Ukraine's reforms and working to root out corruption,\" Pyatt said, \"corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General’s Office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.\"\n\nIn October 2015, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations committee the Prosecutor General's Office must lock up \"dirty personnel\" in its own office.\n\nIn December 2015, Biden railed against the \"cancer of corruption\" in a speech before the country's parliament and called out Shokin's office.\n\nBesides Biden's threat over the $1 billion in aid, the International Monetary Fund threatened to delay $40 billion in aid for similar reasons.\n\nShokin was eventually removed from his position in the spring of 2016.\n\nThe decision to remove Shokin \"creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the Prosecutor General's Office,\" said Jan Tombinski, the EU's ambassador to Ukraine, in a written statement.\n\n\"I hope,\" Tombinski said, \"that the new Prosecutor General will ensure that the Office of the Prosecutor General becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.\"\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/politics/trump-biden-probes-2024-analysis/index.html", "title": "Dueling probes into Trump and Biden could define the 2024 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA storm of investigations targeting leaders of both political parties will shape the 2024 campaign, but risks angering voters who just showed their frustration with their priorities being ignored.\n\nRepublicans wasted no time after finally crawling last week to the 218 seats needed to win the House to promise relentless investigations of President Joe Biden’s administration, policies and family. The thin nature of their majority, which takes over in January, is already offering their most extreme members significant leverage over leadership.\n\nIn a momentous move, meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland last week named a special counsel to take over investigations into Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents and his behavior leading up to the US Capitol insurrection. The decision underscores the gravity of the probes and their threat to Trump but also the extraordinary reality that an ex-president and already declared presidential candidate faces the possibility of indictment during a White House race.\n\nThe political reverberations of the investigations into the current and former president will be immense. They could bear on both Trump’s and Biden’s prospects in the 2024 election, should the president run for reelection, and are certain to deepen the political polarization afflicting America.\n\nAnd they will pose a challenge to both parties since one lesson of the midterm elections was that voters were not happy with the Democrats’ delivery on the economy but didn’t trust radical election-denying Republicans to do better. The aftermath of the 2022 campaign – a competitive presidential race and split control of Congress featuring tiny majorities – now offers either side a chance to grab all the levers of Washington power in 2024 by shaping a fresh message that this time really addresses voters’ needs.\n\nBut it is not yet clear how the flurry of investigations will help either Democrats or Republicans satisfy their voters’ most fundamental concerns.\n\nTrump, who has not been charged with a crime, is facing formal criminal probes from the Justice Department that will now be overseen by the special counsel. And the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, although it has no power to charge Trump, has built up a damning picture of his conduct and is expected to release a final report by the end of the year. Next year, Republicans investigating Biden will be under pressure to demonstrate they are conducting genuine oversight and not simply partisan show hearings for political reasons.\n\nRepublicans line up a withering set of probes against the White House\n\nAfter failing to capture the Senate, Republicans will lack the authority to enact a conservative agenda, so the most obvious way for them to wield power will be in a barrage of House investigations targeting the administration, which they clearly hope will weaken Biden in the run-up to the 2024 election and help the eventual GOP nominee.\n\n“We finally have a check and balance,” Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who is seeking to become the new speaker in January, said at the Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nAlready, the incoming GOP majority is promising probes of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, China, the conduct of government health officials during Covid-19, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, the situation at the southern border, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, Garland and Education Department officials. Also in their sights is the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and claims his business dealings caused ethical clashes for the president himself.\n\nA long string of televised hearings, document subpoenas and demands for testimony is expected, for which the White House, as CNN reported last week, has been preparing for months.\n\nMcCarthy, who needs the support of hardline pro-Trump lawmakers to become speaker next year, confirmed in his Republican Jewish Coalition speech and on Fox Sunday that he will block a trio of Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees, respectively.\n\nThe move is seen as revenge for when the Democratic-led House stripped Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee posts over her apparent condoning of violent social media posts against Democrats before she was elected. Greene spent part of the weekend retweeting Trump’s historic tweets making false claims of election fraud and misinformation after the ex-president’s Twitter account was restored by the platform’s new owner Elon Musk. Greene is already one of the most visible members of the incoming GOP majority, having launched a bid to end US aid to Ukraine. She also demanded the impeachment of Garland following his appointment of a special counsel.\n\nInvestigation and oversight is an essential function of Congress, so McCarthy’s majority will be well within its rights to unleash the machinery of accountability.\n\nAt the same time, however, many of the lines of investigation appear highly politicized and some seem to arise out of accusations and conspiracies carried on conservative media more than they spring out of good governance.\n\nThe challenge for Republicans will be to leave a broad range of voters, who had already shown little patience for GOP election denialism, with the impression that they are using the power granted to them in the midterms to address issues, like high inflation, that they care about. An out-of-control juggernaut of politicized investigations could harm the GOP by the time of the next election.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is expected to become the New Democratic leader after Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week she would step down, vowed Sunday to hold the new majority to account.\n\n“We will fiercely and vigorously oppose any attempts at Republican overreach and any Republican extremism,” Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”\n\n“I’m hopeful that the Republican leadership will take lessons away from the rejection of extremism by the American people all across the land, and not double and triple down on it in the next Congress.”\n\nOne goal of the new Republican majority, which will be closely attuned to Trump’s wishes, is likely to be to frustrate or punish attempts by the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the former president, who launched his third consecutive presidential bid last week. And in the same way that McCarthy once implied the GOP’s Benghazi investigations were intended to weaken former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign, the GOP probes will also be taking aim at Biden’s political prospects.\n\nGOP Rep. Jim Comer of Kentucky, the likely next head of the House Oversight Committee, indicated in a CNN interview last week that Republicans would try to connect Hunter Biden’s business dealings in places like Ukraine to his father.\n\n“This needs to be called the Biden investigation and not the Hunter Biden investigation,” he said.\n\nIan Sams, a spokesman for the White House Counsel’s office, accused the GOP of seeking revenge and of mounting politically motivated attacks based on “long-debunked conspiracy theories.”\n\nBut the spotlight being trained on Hunter Biden could prove especially painful in a personal sense for his father, whatever its political consequences.\n\nAs well as congressional probes, federal authorities are weighing criminal charges against Hunter Biden over a gun purchase and tax issues. In an interview with Tapper last month, the president said he was a proud of his son, who he said had overcome a drug addiction.\n\nThe special counsel’s threat to Trump’s 2024 campaign\n\nTrump’s personal, political and legal exposure to investigations is far more tangible than the level of threat facing his successor. The appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith last week – to avoid the impression of political interference now that the former commander in chief is again an official candidate – is a mark of the breadth and seriousness of the legal complications that he is facing.\n\nTrump’s early announcement of a 2024 bid was widely seen as partly an attempt to try to insulate himself against possible charges and to portray the investigations as a political vendetta against him. “It is not acceptable. It is so unfair. It is so political,” the ex-president told Fox News Digital last week. He also warned that “the Republican Party has to stand up and fight” – seeking to unite the GOP around him at a moment when his hold on the party is facing its biggest question in years over the poor performance of candidates he backed in the midterm elections.\n\nIn the wake of the special counsel decision, several potential 2024 Republican rivals have endorsed the ex-president’s claims that he is being politically targeted as some of them try to appeal to his base. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who has criticized Trump’s conduct after the 2020 election in a string of recent interviews, called the appointment of a special counsel “very troubling” in an interview with Fox. Another frequent Trump critic and possible 2024 GOP candidate, outgoing Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, said that the special counsel appointment was “not good news for our country.”\n\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a once and possible future GOP presidential candidate, said on his podcast that Biden had turned the United States into a banana republic by weaponizing the DOJ against the former president. (During his administration, Trump was repeatedly accused of weaponizing the Justice Department by using it to pursue his political ends and in seeking to influence its investigations – for example, in firing of former FBI Director James Comey.)\n\nUntil the special counsel makes his decisions, the investigation into Trump will be a dominant backdrop to his presidential campaign. Already, Trump is using his timeworn tactic of smearing institutions that seek to probe or hold him to account – a process that inevitably damages them in the eyes of millions of his supporters.\n\nA decision on whether to indict a major presidential candidate will be one of the most fateful moments in the modern history of the DOJ and will have enormous legal and constitutional implications.\n\nBut the investigation also poses a political threat to the former president. An unusual number of Republicans are increasingly willing to criticize him in public and to argue that the party should turn to another nominee in 2024. An indictment or just a long-running investigation could finally give Republicans, at least in its Washington establishment, an excuse to break with Trump in favor of an alternative candidate not tainted by scandal or caught up in election denialism and the January 6 insurrection.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/politics/classified-information-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The number of people with Top Secret clearance will shock you ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Jon Elswick/AP\n\nThere are other questions, of course. Did he take the material because he thought they were “cool,” like some kind of trophy? Or did he see some advantage in having them, The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wondered during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday.\n\nWere the documents related to Roger Stone’s pardon by Trump somehow key evidence? What is behind the appearance of material on the “President of France” in the receipt for what was taken?\n\nThe imagination runs wild in the absence of facts.\n\nTrump has now demanded the documents be returned, even though presidential papers, under US law, are not his property.\n\nThe most tantalizing detail is that 11 sets of documents were classified.\n\nIt’s shining a light on the system of classification by which the government hides information from its people in the name of everyone’s national security.\n\nMore than a million people have Top Secret clearance\n\nIt’s actually a very large universe of people with access to Top Secret data.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence publishes what is described as an annual report, “Security Clearance Determinations,” although the most recent one I could find was from 2017.\n\nIn it, more than 2.8 million people are described as having security clearance as of October 2017 – more than 1.6 million have access to either Confidential or Secret information and nearly 1.2 million are described as having access to Top Secret information.\n\nThere are additional people who have security clearance but don’t currently have access to information. This includes civilian employees, contractors and members of the military.\n\nAgencies control their own classified data. They are supposed to declassify it\n\nThat doesn’t mean more than 1 million people have access to whatever Top Secret documents were lying around Mar-a-Lago. Each agency that deals in classification has its own system and is supposed to be involved in declassifying its own documents.\n\nTrump’s defenders have argued he had put in place an order to declassify any documents he took from the Oval Office to the residence during his time in the White House, although professionals have said this claim can’t be true.\n\n“The idea that the president can declassify documents simply by moving them from one physical location to another is nonsense on so many levels,” said Shawn Turner, a CNN analyst and former director of communication for US National Intelligence, during a Monday appearance on “Inside Politics.”\n\nThere’s an official process\n\nTurner said the process for declassification must include signoff from the agency that classified the information in the first place in order to protect the intelligence-gathering process, its sources and methods.\n\nPresidents have periodically used executive orders to update the official system by which classified information is declassified.\n\nMost recently, then-President Barack Obama put in place Executive Order 13526 in 2009. That’s still the official policy since neither Trump nor President Joe Biden updated it.\n\nThe government might soon change the process\n\nBiden started a review of how classified data is handled earlier this summer. Here’s an exhaustive Congressional Research Service report on the declassification process.\n\nBiden’s review will reexamine the three general levels of classification.\n\nLevels of classification\n\nCNN’s Katie Lobosco wrote a very good primer on classified data last week. Here’s her description of the three levels of classification:\n\nTop Secret – This is the highest level of classification. Information is classified as Top Secret if it “reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security,” according to a 2009 executive order that describes the classification system.\n\nA subset of Top Secret documents known as SCI, or sensitive compartmented information, is reserved for certain information derived from intelligence sources. Access to an SCI document can be even further restricted to a smaller group of people with specific security clearances.\n\nSome of the materials recovered from Trump’s Florida home were marked as Top Secret SCI.\n\nSecret – Information is classified as Secret if the information is deemed to be able to cause “serious damage” to national security if revealed.\n\nConfidential – Confidential is the least sensitive level of classification, applied to information that is reasonably expected to cause “damage” to national security if disclosed.\n\nWhat kinds of things are Top Secret?\n\nThe former CIA officer David Priess, who is now publisher of the website Lawfare, said on “New Day” that no matter the specific classification, it’s information the government has an interest in not being made public.\n\nIt could be intelligence gathered on the North Korean nuclear program or Russian military operations, for example.\n\nLeaks can be disastrous or deadly\n\nThe government often gets this type of information by asking people to risk their lives or using technology it doesn’t want adversaries to know about.\n\nTalking about it on Monday morning, Priess became emotional.\n\n“Exposing this information put people’s lives at risk,” he said. “That’s not a joke. We know people who have died serving their country this way.”\n\nWhat took so long?\n\nThe larger question than what’s classified, Priess argued, is why, if the government knew the documents were at Mar-a-Lago, it took investigators so long to go get them.\n\nIn order for a president to declassify anything, he argued, there still needs to be a paper trail so everyone knows something is declassified.\n\n“If they’re not marked declassified and other documents with the same information aren’t also declassified, did it really happen? If there’s no record of it, how do you even know?”\n\nWe may not know more for a very long time\n\nThe problem now may be that imaginations will run wild about what is in the documents.\n\nIt could be a very long time before American voters have any idea what this was all really about.\n\n“Technically we won’t see any further action on this case on the legal docket unless and until DOJ brings criminal charges against any person,” said CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, also on “New Day.”\n\nRELATED: DOJ opposes making public details in Mar-a-Lago search warrant’s probable cause affidavit\n\nAlready there is some speculation that rather than pursue charges, the government was simply trying to secure the data.\n\nClassified information can stay that way for years and years – between 10 and 25, according to the declassification guidelines signed by Obama.\n\nThe standard is that if something no longer needs to be classified, it should be declassified. And if it needs to be classified past that 25-year period, it can be.\n\nLook at the Top Secret documents of yore\n\nThe FBI, CIA and State Department all have online reading rooms of previously classified data released through the Freedom of Information Act. None of it is very recent stuff.\n\nThe case of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago documents seems special, however, and there are already bipartisan calls from Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio – the top elected officials on the Senate Intelligence Committee – to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for more information about what was taken by the FBI.\n\nExamples of prosecutions\n\nProsecutions for mishandling of classified data can involve high-profile figures.\n\nFor example, retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus gave classified information to his mistress, who was writing a book about him. He ultimately pleaded guilty, paid a $100,000 fine and got two years of probation.\n\nWhat data did he mishandle? From CNN’s report at the time: During his time as commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks. The classified information (included) identity of covert officers, war strategy, notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words.\n\nOther figures are not as familiar – like Asia Janay Lavarello, a civilian Defense Department employee working in the US Embassy in Manila, who took classified documents to her hotel room and her house while she was working on a thesis project.

But as soon as the drug-addicted son of future President Joe Biden walked through the door, he realized the family was planning an intervention, not a meal.\n\nAmid the tears, yelling and accusations of betrayal that followed, a visibly terrified Joe Biden turned to his son and pleaded. “I don’t know what else to do,” he cried out. “I’m so scared. Tell me what to do.”\n\nAnna LaBarre knows that feeling of helplessness. She, too, has watched as an adult child with a brilliant future teetered close to self-destruction under the demons of addiction. On her work break, LaBarre used to get in her car, drive through the streets and alleys of Columbus, Ohio, and search for her daughter. She had no plans to approach the young woman should she actually find her. She just wanted to know she was alive.\n\n“I don’t understand,” she’d often tell her daughter in a cry that eerily echoed Joe Biden’s words to his son. “Help me understand. I can’t help you.”\n\nHunter Biden’s battle with substance use is back in the spotlight as the White House prepares for the possibility that the president’s youngest son could face criminal charges. Federal prosecutors are reportedly nearing a decision on whether to charge Hunter Biden with tax crimes and with making a false statement about a gun purchase.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nNo one can say with certainty the toll that Hunter Biden’s addiction has exacted on the president and his family. Every case of addiction is different. Every family is affected in different ways.\n\nBut while for most Americans addiction is a private family affair, many choose to keep a child’s or sibling’s substance abuse – and the criminal behavior that often accompanies it – a secret from even their most intimate friends. Hunter Biden’s struggles have played out in public and in the political sphere inhabited by his father. Further complicating matters: Republicans have repeatedly sought to use the federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s private affairs, and at times even his drug addiction, as part of their campaign to portray the Biden family as corrupt.\n\nPerhaps more than anyone else, families whose lives have been wrecked by the disease of addiction understand what the Bidens have endured as Hunter Biden fought through recovery. No one can know what it’s like to have a child or sibling face down addiction until you’ve gone through it yourself, they say. Addiction traumatizes not only the person suffering from dependency. It terrorizes the entire family.\n\n“It was horrible,” said John Koch of Chicago, who got a protective order to keep his son, John Alexander Koch, away from the rest of the family when the son was deep in the throes of substance abuse. “I would not wish it upon anybody.”\n\nFamilies who’ve lived through the trauma of addiction find it appalling that anyone’s substance abuse issues would be turned into a political weapon, regardless of party affiliation. Hunter Biden’s experiences show that addiction still carries a devastating stigma despite advances in the treatment and public perception of the disease.\n\n“There’s really no one who is immune to this,” said Alexis Pleus of Windsor, New York, whose son, Jeff Dugon, died of an accidental heroin overdose. “It doesn’t matter – race, class, gender, what your income is, in the public eye, out of the public eye. Anyone can be affected. No one should be judged for this. Absolutely no one.”\n\nNot even the president's son.\n\n'My son has done nothing wrong':Biden defends son, Hunter Biden, in first interview since announcing his reelection bid\n\n'You gotta get some help'\n\nJoe Biden, who has made overdose and addiction issues a priority for his administration, rarely speaks publicly about his son’s substance abuse. The White House declined to comment for this article.\n\nOn the few occasions when the president has spoken about his son’s addiction, it has usually been to vigorously defend him against partisan attacks.\n\nWhen Donald Trump invoked Hunter Biden’s drug abuse during a presidential debate in 2020, Joe Biden came to his son’s defense. “My son – like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home – had a drug problem,” Biden said. “He’s overtaken it, he’s fixed it, he’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him.”\n\nIn an interview with CBS News on Feb. 5, 2021, an emotional Biden again praised his son for writing honestly about his addiction in his memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you there's not a family you know that didn't have somebody in the family who had a drug problem, or an alcohol problem,\" the president said. \"And he's gone through hell.\"\n\nReading the memoir gave him hope, Biden said. \"I mean, it was like my boy's back,\" he said, his voice breaking.\n\nHunter Biden has spoken candidly and written extensively about his battle with substance abuse. In his 2021 memoir, he recounted times when he would smoke crack cocaine every 15 minutes, the two weeks he spent thousands of dollars on drugs, and the 2019 intervention that ended with his father chasing him around outside the family home in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nHe recalled how his father’s enemies exploited his demons and addictions for political gain.\n\n“Where’s Hunter?” was a frequent refrain among Republicans during the 2020 presidential contest. Trump’s campaign made up T-shirts bearing the phrase and sold them for $25 a pop, in sizes ranging from small to XXXL.\n\nLast fall, a private voice message that Joe Biden left to his son on Oct. 15, 2018, was leaked and aired by Fox News host Sean Hannity, ostensibly to provide insight into Hunter Biden’s state of mind when he filled out the gun application under investigation by authorities.\n\nJoe Biden’s message to his son on that voicemail: “It's Dad. I called to tell you I love you. I love you more than the whole world, pal. You gotta get some help. I know you don't know what to do. I don't either.\"\n\nBrandon Swinehart, who lived on the streets of San Francisco’s Tenderloin district for two years when he was heavily using drugs, can’t understand how a father’s message of love and support to a son who is battling addiction could end up being a political issue. Using Hunter Biden’s addiction to score political points is “probably the most despicable thing I’ve seen in my life,” he said.\n\n“If some Republican’s child had these issues and a Democrat did the same thing, I’d say the same thing,” said Swinehart, who has been sober for 18 years and now runs a screen-printing business in Cincinnati, Ohio. “This has nothing to do with competency or being president. This is someone’s family. It’s a family affair. Please stay out of it.”\n\nInfluence peddling?House GOP: Hunter Biden, others got $1.3M from business associate linked to China\n\n'Why did they choose drugs over me?'\n\nGracie Parker never knew her mother. A heavy drug user, the young mom overdosed and was found dead at the bottom of a river six months after Gracie was born. Her father, who also suffers from a substance use disorder, has spent much of his life in and out of jail and rehab and has had next to no involvement in Gracie’s life.\n\n“Why did they choose drugs over me?” Gracie often wonders of her mom and dad.\n\nAt age 10, she has become an advocate for other children dealing with trauma and has spoken at events across North Carolina and in Washington. Her grandparents, James Parker and Elke Kennedy of Franklin, North Carolina, have custody of her and are raising her.\n\nAddiction “changes your whole life,” said James Parker, whose son is Gracie’s father.\n\nGracie’s father has no idea what she goes through, “and that makes me mad,” James Parker said. “Why should my daughter have to stand up and talk about mental health for children at 10 years old?”\n\nOther families tell similar stories of how a son’s or daughter’s addiction has destroyed marriages, of how an in-law’s drug use has sowed lasting distrust and caused financial ruin, of how the trauma of a brother’s or sister’s behavior has lingered long after they’ve gone into recovery – if they were lucky enough to survive.\n\n“I impacted my family and those who cared about me in so many different ways,” said Amy Molinski of Waterford, Wisconsin, who started using cocaine at age 17 and eventually gravitated toward heroin and oxycontin.\n\nMolinski has been clean for 13 years and works as a peer support counselor at a drug addiction treatment center, but her mother was recently diagnosed with PTSD.\n\n“Everything scares her,” Molinski said. “Everything startles her, and she may jump or yell or scream. And it really traces back to my addiction and the amount of trauma that caused her.”\n\nMolinski’s sister-in-law, Annie Molinski of Burlington, Wisconsin, recalled the years when Amy was using drugs as “a deep and dark, devastating time” for the family. Amy Molinski was smart, crafty and deceptive, “a master manipulator” who would steal anything of value to support her habit, including money that her brother and future sister-in-law had saved for their wedding. One time, she even pawned her mother’s wedding ring for a fix.\n\n“At a certain point, we were just in survival mode,” said Annie Molinski, who recalls staying at her in-laws’ home, reaching into the bathroom cabinet drawer for her toothbrush and accidentally grabbing hold of a heroin needle instead.\n\n'Bunch of Malarkey':Biden dismisses GOP bribery allegations\n\n'So awful, you almost wish it was over'\n\nJohn Alexander Koch of Phoenix, who was incarcerated 26 times and placed in treatment 22 times during his battle with heroin and opioid use, remembers his mother getting down on her hands and knees in prayer position and begging him not to leave their home because she knew he was going to buy drugs.\n\n“‘I love you – I will do everything in my power to get you help, please don’t go and use these drugs that are going to kill you,’” he recalls her pleading. All he could think of “was not that my mother is crying in front of me or that I’ve hurt her so bad,” he said. “It was that I hope my ride gets here soon enough so that I can take this $40 I have and feel better.”\n\nAnother time, Koch overdosed on fentanyl-laced heroin in the basement of the family home after Thanksgiving Dinner. A friend who supplied the drugs and was with Koch called 911. Unaware of the life-and-death drama unfolding just feet from them, his parents were relaxing upstairs on the couch.\n\n“They got a knock on the door,” said Koch, who has been in recovery for a decade and is now part of the senior leadership at Community Medical Services, a treatment program that helped change his life. “It was the ambulance, and they said you need to let us in right now. Someone’s dying in your basement.”\n\nHis father followed the EMTs downstairs and watched as they injected his son with Narcan, which reverses opioid overdoses. Their quick action saved his son's life. But the horror of that ordeal turned the father into an advocate for making access to the drug more widely available – something that also has been a goal of the Biden administration.\n\n“When it gets so bad, it’s so awful, you almost wish it was over,” the father said. “Because you just don’t know how much more you’re able to take.”\n\nFor years, LaBarre’s daughter, Jessie Jennings of Columbus, Ohio, looked back on her addiction and the toll it took on her family with a sense of shame.\n\nShame eventually turned to guilt, which enabled to her to start making amends to those she loved – for stealing money, jewelry, property, anything of value to support her habit, for selling the gift cards her parents gave her to purchase groceries and then using the money for drugs, for calling on her parents to pay her overdue rent so she wouldn’t get evicted and turned out onto the streets.\n\nSwinehart, who grew up in a wealthy Cincinnati suburb, overdosed 20 times and spent 13 months in prison when he was hooked on heroin and other drugs. He would often go months at a time without any contact with his parents or other loved ones. During those prolonged periods, his father would call the morgue to see if he had died.\n\n“They loved it when I was in jail,” he said. “Because they knew where I was, that I was safe.”\n\nAfter her son’s death from an overdose, Pleus started Truth Pharm, a nonprofit organization that works to educate people on harm reduction strategies and serves as a voice for those struggling with substance abuse.\n\nPleus applauds Hunter Biden for being open about his struggles. The scrutiny and criticism the Bidens and others in the public eye face can be crushing. But, Pleus said, their openness is helping to shed some of the stigma of addiction.\n\n“It’s really important to get the message out to people that they shouldn’t struggle alone and that they shouldn’t struggle in shame and silence,” she said. “We have to break the stigma by talking about this more. That’s how we’re going to solve the problem.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

White in Northern California ruled in favor of a lawsuit brought by the Humane Society of the United States and other wildlife organizations against the US Department of the Interior in January 2021.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) “failed to adequately analyze and consider the impacts of partial delisting and of historical range loss on the already-listed species,” White wrote in his decision, which restored gray wolf protections in 45 states.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed the USFWS did not take proper consideration when it stripped the animal of Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections, which went into effect in January 2021, under the assumption its population sufficiently recovered.\n\n“Today is a monumental victory for wolves who will now be protected from state-sponsored bloodbaths,” Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society, said in a statement.\n\n“After having yet another wolf delisting overturned in federal court, the US Fish and Wildlife Service should finally learn its lesson,” she added. “Instead of continuing to devise convoluted excuses to strip these beloved animals of legal protections, the agency must develop a plan for meaningful recovery across the species’ range and ensure that states will not decimate their wolf populations.”\n\nThe federal government has 60 days to appeal the court’s decision.\n\nOnly the Northern Rockies population of wolves remains unprotected as a result of laws that passed in Idaho and Montana, according to the Humane Society, but the USFWS is currently considering relisting them to the act.\n\nSix Native American Ojibwe tribes also sued the state of Wisconsin last year, claiming the state’s planned wolf hunts go against their treaty-protected rights, CNN previously reported.\n\nAfter the species were stripped of federal protections, Wisconsin hunters killed more than 215 wolves in under three days as part of a February 2021 trophy hunting season, exceeding the state’s quote by nearly double, according to the Humane Society.\n\nThe gray wolf received protection from the ESA in the 1970s, when the population dwindled due to declines in their populations and frequent conflict with farmers and ranchers.\n\nCertain wolf populations on the West Coast and in the Southern Rocky Mountains are especially vulnerable and were at risk of “disappearing forever” as a result of the Trump-era decision, the Humane Society said in a statement when the lawsuit was filed.\n\n“Our lawsuit argues that by treating the plight of these fragile populations as insignificant and ignoring the natural and manmade threats that wolves nationwide still face, the government is in violation of the Endangered Species Act and its legal duty of protecting wolves and helping them recover,” the statement read.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who took part in an amicus brief in the coalition’s lawsuit, said her state is home to roughly 700 gray wolves.\n\n“These magnificent animals serve important roles in our Great Lakes ecosystems, and they show us that dedication to family is not unique to humans,” Nessel said in a statement.\n\nSome hunter advocacy groups rejected the decision, however, arguing it will affect predator management programs that aim to reduce predation.\n\n“We are disappointed that an activist judge from California decided to tell farmers, ranchers, and anyone who supports a balanced ecosystem with common-sense predator management that he knows better than them,” said Hunter Nation President and CEO Luke Hilgemann in a statement.\n\n“At Hunter Nation, we prefer to trust local experts and conservation and hunting partners to come up with predator management programs that make sense for them rather than putting our faith in bureaucrats who don’t spend time in the woods or never have to deal with the negative consequences of an uncontrolled wolf population.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Hannah Sarisohn", "Emma Tucker", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/02/12"}]}

The median rent – which is the mid-point of all rents – just rose above $4,000 a month for the first time in May.\n\nThe average monthly rent – which is the sum of all rents divided by the number of rents included in the data – was even higher at $5,058 in June. That’s up nearly 30% from a year ago and marked the first time the average has gone above $5,000 a month.\n\nRents were pushed higher, in part, by would-be home buyers who decided to put their search on hold and rent instead, said Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel.\n\n“You have more people pivoting, they were on the margin to buy a home, but now with mortgage rates spiking, they are in the rental market,” said Miller. “The market is already tight. This makes it tighter.”\n\nThose renters typically have more money to spend and often need a larger, more expensive family apartment, pushing the average higher.\n\nThe average price for a three-bedroom apartment in June was $9,469 a month, up from $7,394 a year ago.

Concessions were offered on only 15% of new listings, down from 34% a year ago.\n\nBidding wars increased for the fourth straight month, especially in the luxury market.\n\nHow long will prices continue to climb?\n\n“Nothing goes up forever, but in the near term we are poised for more gains,” said Miller.\n\nLooking toward the fall and into next year, he said there will be an affordability threshold that renters will come up against. But even then, prices are more likely to level off than drop.\n\n“As things are now, I’m not sure what causes rents to drop,” he said. “But a recession is the asterisk in the conversation. The Fed is taking a baseball bat to the economy and there are more rate increases in store. There is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/961783/the-uks-looming-rental-crisis", "title": "The UK's looming rental crisis | The Week", "text": "In the latest crisis to hit UK renters, private rents have risen at their fastest since 2016, according to new data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThe ONS data is the latest concern for private renters who are “being forced into bidding wars”, ITV said, as “rents spiral and demand outstrips supply”.\n\nSo intense is the competition that there are now 20 requests to view each available property across the country, according to data commissioned by the BBC.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Numbers are even higher in some regions, reaching 30 in the Northwest of England.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis “mismatch” between demand from tenants and supply from landlords “has contributed to sharp increases in rents”, said the BBC. Rental costs are also rising because landlords themselves have been “hit with rising costs,” the broadcaster added, “from repairs to significant increases in mortgage rates”.\n\nThe message that demand has outstripped supply is “not good enough”, countered Portia Msimang, citing landlords offering properties to the highest bidder. “It’s not inevitable, it’s what [landlords] choose to do, and that’s what needs to be reined in”.\n\nHow many people are affected?\n\nThe situation for renters is “already dire”, said the Financial Times (FT). Currently in the UK there are approximately 5.5 million private rental homes, where more than a third of tenants spend half their take-home pay on rent – a rate that is considered “severely rent burdened”, according to a survey of 11,000 people by Spareroom, the flat-sharing platform.\n\nIn the first three months of this year, evictions due to rent arrears reached the highest level of records going back to 2009, the FT noted, while “no-fault” evictions rose to their highest level since 2017.\n\nAccording to City Monitor, ​taking rent together with food inflation and rising bills over the past year, “this is the latest pinch putting tenants at the heart of the housing crisis in cities”.\n\nWhat is causing the crisis?\n\nThis crisis has been a long time coming, said Alex Diner, a senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation, in The Guardian.\n\nWhen rent controls were abolished in the late 1980s, the then housing minister, Sir George Young, pledged that “housing benefit will take the strain”.\n\n“And so it came to pass,” Diner said. “For many landlords, taxpayers’ cash became a business strategy… In effect, we are all subsidising the private rental sector”.\n\nHowever, over time “the burden has shifted on to tenants”, he added, as rates of housing benefits have been repeatedly frozen since 2016, and people who were previously eligible for support have been increasingly excluded, meaning that now “it is both taxpayers and tenants who are taking the strain”.\n\nAre rent controls the answer?\n\nSome people argue that the only solution to the brewing crisis is the reintroduction of rent controls – an idea that “tends to attract popular support”, said university professors Alex Marsh and Kenneth Gibb in The Conversation. But “research shows… that rent control on its own cannot fix things,” they added. “It must go hand in hand with additional social housing and further measures to address housing affordability.”\n\nFor its part, the government has been working towards the introduction of the Renters' Reform Bill, which would bring an end to section 21 “no-fault” evictions as well as introducing a private rental ombudsman to help enforce renters’ rights and making it illegal for landlords and agents to refuse to rent properties to people who receive benefits.\n\nHowever, “the government has been promising these changes since 2019”, said ITV, and so far they are yet to be passed.\n\nThe current situation “cannot be reduced just to a rental crisis”, said Investors’ Chronicle, adding that what we are witnessing is “a full-blown housing crisis”.\n\nThe “widening gap between supply and demand of houses, rising costs and wages falling behind housing costs and inflation” are having “detrimental effects on the economy”, and all the while “more of our money goes on covering up the lack of investment in housing”.\n\n“Housing affordability is a complex problem”, agreed Alex Marsh and Kenneth Gibb. Resolving it will “demand a suitably subtle combination of policies”.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Joel Mathis", "Jamie Timson"], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/957623/rental-prices-in-london-the-cheapest-and-most-expensive-boroughs", "title": "Rental prices in London: the cheapest and most expensive ...", "text": "Rental prices in London have undergone their largest annual rise in over 20 years as people return to the capital after the Covid crisis.\n\nPrime London rental values increased by 3.3% between April and June this year, taking annual growth to 13.5%, according to property firm Savills.\n\nFlats are continuing to outperform houses, which have started to see rental growth soften following significant gains during the pandemic, said the i news site.

The trend has attracted attention from across the Atlantic, with CNBC noting the “eyewatering” rental prices.\n\nMeanwhile, homelessness among private renters has hit record highs, Sky News reported, mostly because landlords are choosing to sell or re-let their properties. The capital is suffering particularly badly: although homelessness rates among single households fell 2.8% in England overall, there was a 9.4% increase in London.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Borough Cost of renting Kensington and Chelsea £2,757 Westminster £2,517 City of London £2,229 Camden £2,193 Hammersmith and Fulham £1,956 Islington £1,924 Wandsworth £1,855 Hackney £1,745 Southwark £1,737 Tower Hamlets £1,728 Richmond upon Thames £1,705 Lambeth £1,692 Newham £1,587 Haringey £1,576 Merton £1,548 Ealing £1,530 Brent £1,454 Greenwich £1,444 Hounslow £1,433 Barnet £1,406 Kingston upon Thames £1,406 Lewisham £1,394 Waltham Forest £1,380 Enfield £1,349 Harrow £1,335 Bromley £1,323 Redbridge £1,299 Barking and Dagenham £1,286 Hillingdon £1,250 Croydon £1,245 Bexley £1,201 Sutton £1,191 Havering £1,166\n\n*Office for National Statistics, Private rental market in London: April 2021 to March 2022, mean price for two-bedroom property", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Catherine Garcia", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Julia O'Driscoll"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/economy/mortgage-rates-june-23/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates rise again, pricing more buyers out of the housing ...", "text": "Mortgage rates continue to climb as the Federal Reserve seeks to tame unwieldy inflation.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.81% in the week ending June 23, edging up from 5.78% the week before, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nThis time last year, rates averaged 3.02%, and the last time rates were this high was in the winter of 2008.\n\n“Fixed mortgage rates have increased by more than two full percentage points since the beginning of the year,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement. “The combination of rising rates and high home prices is the likely driver of recent declines in existing home sales. However, in reality, many potential homebuyers are still interested in purchasing a home, keeping the market competitive but leveling off the last two years of red-hot activity.”\n\nDespite the jumps, mortgage rates remain well below historical highs notched during the past 40 years – notably the record 18.63% average rate in October 1981.\n\nStill, the sharpness of current mortgage rate increases combined with the spike in borrowing costs will ultimately make consumers more cautious, said Abbey Omodunbi, assistant vice president and senior economist for The PNC Financial Services Group.\n\n“I think we’re likely to see further increases in mortgage rates through the rest of the year,” Omodunbi said in an interview with CNN Business. “The Fed wants to see softening housing activity.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year US Treasury bonds. But rates are indirectly impacted by the Fed’s actions on inflation. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and with it, mortgage rates.\n\nDuring its policymaking meeting last week, the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points, the largest such increase in three decades. In public comments made since, including in testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank’s actions should help dampen demand in the nation’s housing market, which has been running white-hot.\n\nHome prices surged during the past two years in part due to record-low mortgage rates, pandemic-related migration patterns, the influence of investment firms buying residential properties, and the Fed’s purchase of mortgage bonds.\n\nRents and home prices continue to rise at double-digit rates in many areas.\n\n“Housing prices should stop going up at such remarkably rapid rates,” Powell said Wednesday in a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve had a very, very hot … housing market all across the country. As demand for housing moderates…you should see prices stop going up.”\n\nStill, the flip side of higher mortgage rates in a high-inflation environment and record home costs could ultimately price out millions more Americans from owning a home, according to Harvard University’s annual State of the Nation’s Housing Report released Wednesday.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median-priced $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 3.02% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,673, according to numbers from Freddie Mac.\n\nAt today’s rate of 5.81%, the monthly mortgage payment on that same house would be $2,187, a difference of $514.\n\nHousing already appears to be transitioning to a “post-pandemic new normal,” said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research. Rents hit a record high for the 15th consecutive month, but the pace of growth is slowing, he said, adding that home price gains are also declining.\n\n“Market prices will continue adjusting to a smaller pool of qualified buyers and higher financing costs,” he said in a statement. “The move from an overheated real estate market toward a more sustainable one will take some time. The upside is that eventually we should see a healthier environment with more options and better value for many buyers.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/homes/us-rent-january-buy-or-rent/index.html", "title": "Buying a home is more affordable than renting in these cities | CNN ...", "text": "Across the US rent is rising so fast that in many cities buying has become more affordable than renting, even with sky-high home sale prices.\n\nThe national median rental price jumped 19.8% in January from a year ago, marking the eighth straight month of double-digit increases, according to a report from Realtor.com. The national median rent was $1,789 last month.\n\n“US rental markets are more than making up for lost time,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. Rents have now gone up 21% from January 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic.\n\nJanuary’s biggest rent jump was in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach areas of Florida where the median rent was $2,895 a month in January, up 52.4% from last year. Miami is now the fifth most expensive place to rent in the country after several cities in California: San Jose, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nThe report found that the monthly cost of buying a starter home was more affordable than renting a similar-sized unit in more than half of the 50 biggest US cities.\n\nWhile many people looking for an affordable place to live feel stuck between a rock and a hard place as both rent and homebuying costs are rising, a number of factors could tip the affordability scale in favor of people buying a home for the first time this year, Hale said.\n\nRents are forecast to outpace for-sale listing price growth in 2022 and are already accelerating across all sizes of rentals. Additionally, she said, survey data shows the majority of landlords plan to further raise the rents they ask this year.\n\nWhere it’s better to buy\n\nLooking at national median home prices and rents, the monthly cost of renting is still slightly cheaper than owning a starter home, the report found.\n\nBut in 26 of the 50 biggest cities, the monthly cost of buying a starter home was an average of 20.6% – or $323 – less than renting one in January, according to Realtor.com.\n\nBuying was most advantageous in Birmingham, Alabama, where the cost of buying a starter home was 44.3% less than the cost of renting in January. It was followed by Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis.\n\nTwo cities in Florida – Tampa and Orlando – saw some of January’s fastest annual rent growth. In Orlando, buying was 27.1% less than renting and in Tampa, buying was 25.5% less.\n\nJust because it is better to buy in a city doesn’t mean home prices aren’t also making strong gains – often it is both. In eight of the top 10 markets favoring buying, both the monthly cost of buying a starter home and renting one increased over the past year, according to the report.\n\nThe rent-or-buy decision ultimately depends on personal circumstances, including location, financial situation and how long a buyer intends to live in the home.\n\nGenerally it is not financially favorable to buy if you plan to live in your home less than a few years and a common rule of thumb is to not spend more than 30% of your income on housing costs, Hale said.\n\nPlus, buying a home is a lot easier said than done in many markets, as the inventory of homes to buy is at a record low.\n\nAnd as mortgage rates continue climbing, the clock is ticking. Those looking to buy their first home in 2022 are more likely to find lower costs now than later in the year, said Hale. But inventory isn’t expected to improve until later this spring.\n\nWhere renting is better\n\nGiven the skyrocketing increase in home prices in some major cities, there are many places where it remains more affordable to rent rather than to dive into the high-priced, competitive housing market, according to the report.\n\nIn January, the monthly cost of buying was about 25% higher – or $536 more – than the cost of renting in 24 of the 50 largest metro areas, on average.\n\nAustin, Texas, was the city where it was most beneficial to rent rather than buy in January. Monthly payments were about 76% higher – or $1,346 more – to buy a starter home in Austin than to rent, according to the analysis. It was followed by New York; San Francisco; San Jose; Seattle; Boston; Denver; Rochester, New York; Portland, Oregon; and Los Angeles.\n\nIn these top ten cities that favored renting, the monthly payments of buying a starter home were 41.6% – or $978 higher than rents – on average. For-sale starter homes in those places included a higher average share of condos than the national rate, and pricier home owner association fees.\n\n“Deciding when to transition from renting to first-time buying is largely dependent on stage of life,” said Hale. “For young Americans like Gen Z who may have moved home to save money during Covid, renting in a big tech city offers flexibility and relative affordability even as rents recover in these areas.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/homes/us-nar-home-sales-december-and-2021/index.html", "title": "Home prices in 2021 rose 16.9%, the highest on record | CNN ...", "text": "The real estate market was on fire last year, with the frenzied pace of sales activity pushing home prices to record highs.\n\nThe median home sales price was $346,900 in 2021, up 16.9% from 2020, and the highest on record going back to 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home sales had the strongest year since 2006, with 6.12 million homes sold, up 8.5% from the year before.\n\nWhile that was bad news for would be buyers, it was a boon for those who already owned a home. A typical homeowner accumulated $50,200 in housing wealth, looking at the median price from 2020 to 2021.\n\n“That is a sizable wealth gain for homeowners across the country,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “The housing market has seen a spectacular performance this last year with sales rising and prices rising. But inventory is at an all-time low.”\n\nBy the end of 2021, there were fewer homes for sale than ever. The inventory of unsold existing homes fell to a record low of 910,000 at the end of December. That’s a 1.8-month supply of homes at the current pace, also an all-time low.\n\nYun anticipates total annual home sales to drop a bit in 2022 as mortgage rates tick up. But he added that employment gains, stricter underwriting standards and continued demand are strong indications that the market is not in danger of crashing.\n\n“This year, consumers should prepare to endure some increases in mortgage rates,” Yun cautioned. “I also expect home prices to grow more moderately by 3% to 5% in 2022, and then similarly in 2023 as more supply reaches the market.”\n\nInventory hits new low\n\nBecause of scarce inventory, sales of existing homes – which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops – dropped 4.6% in December from November, and 7.1% from a year ago.\n\n“December saw sales retreat, but the pullback was more a sign of supply constraints than an indication of a weakened demand for housing,” said Yun.\n\nThe low inventory has also knocked down the sales of homes in affordable price ranges.\n\nHome sales in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down 23.2% in December from the year before. Meanwhile, homes priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw sales rise 32.2% from last year, according to the report.\n\n“The upper end of the market is moving along,” Yun said. “But at the lower end, there is not enough inventory or some homes are being pushed into the higher price brackets.”\n\nMore homes are expected to come onto the market during the spring home selling season, Yun said. And good news also came from the Commerce Department on Wednesday that home building grew in December.\n\n“This new supply is clearly needed, as move-up buyers purchasing new homes will free up existing inventory for the wave of first-time buyers,” said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. “We continue to expect that 2022 will see growth in home sales, decelerating home-price growth, and a record volume of purchase mortgage originations.”\n\n“Homebuilders have already made strides in 2022 to increase supply, but reversing gaps like the ones we’ve seen recently will take years to correct,” said Yun.\n\nHome prices still climbing\n\nWith fewer than one million homes on the market at the end of December, prices continued to climb as buyers raced against the clock to secure low mortgage rates on the homes for sale.\n\n“Even as sales are falling, prices are rising showing that demand is still there,” Yun said.\n\nThe median existing home price for all housing types in December was $358,000, which was up 15.8% from a year ago, marking 118 straight months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record. Prices rose across the country, with the south seeing the biggest appreciation.\n\nIn November, the share of first-time buyers fell to just 26% of all buyers. But in December the share of first-time buyers perked back up to 30%.\n\n“There was a significant surge in first-time buyers at the end of the year,” Yun said. “With mortgage rates expected to rise in 2022, it’s likely that a portion of December buyers were intent on avoiding the inevitable rate increases.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/956437/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-14-april-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 14 April 2022 | The Week", "text": "1.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nThe latest data on consumer prices in the United States showed that annual inflation unexpectedly rose to a 40-year high in May, underscoring concerns about household finances and piling pressure on political leaders who say they’re doing everything they can to address the problem.\n\nWhat’s happening: The Consumer Price Index rose by 8.6% in the 12 months to May. It had fallen slightly to 8.3% in in April.\n\nThat signals to investors that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively hike interest rates through the end of the year as it tries to get inflation under control.\n\n“Upcoming inflation data will be most important for determining the pace of hikes beyond July,” Citi economists said in a note to clients earlier this week.\n\nThe big question for policymakers and Wall Street is whether inflation has peaked. When stripping out volatile food and fuel costs, annual inflation in May rose 6%, slightly lower than in April.\n\n“I’m confident that inflation will be meaningfully lower by this time next year and back to something we will feel comfortable with not too long thereafter,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a column for CNN Business.\n\nHe pointed to the fading impact of the pandemic, and said that after the European Union’s announcement of its oil embargo on Russia, “the worst of the economic fallout from Russia’s aggression also appears at hand.”\n\nBut what happens in the interim remains murky. High fuel and food prices feed through to inflation in other parts of the economy. US gas prices are hovering just a cent below $5 a gallon, and oil prices could go even higher this summer, Goldman Sachs said this week.\n\nOne factor I’ve been watching closely is the cost of housing, also known as “shelter inflation.”\n\nHousing represents about a third of the value of the basket of goods and services that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to track consumer prices, which gives it significant weight in the overall inflation picture. In early 2022, it was a contributor to rising inflation alongside food and energy.\n\nThe shelter index climbed 5.5% over the last year, according to data for May. That was the biggest increase since February 1991.\n\nThat’s already notable. But Citi’s economists warn that the data can be slow to reflect the environment for renters, which means there’s a chance housing costs jump by even more than expected in the coming months.\n\nCheck this out: Rents in Manhattan hit a record high in May for the fourth consecutive month. Median rent for an apartment climbed to $4,000 a month, surging 25% from a year ago — and that’s before the peak summer season for lease signings.\n\nBuyers also continue to feel the effects of record high home prices, though rising mortgage costs are encouraging some Americans to delay purchases.\n\n“Generally, while housing demand has just recently shown signs of slowing, house prices continue to rise at a strong pace and suggest it will be some time (well into next year) before shelter prices could start to slow further,” Citi’s team said.\n\nOn the radar: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in February that rents and home prices can push up the CPI reading “for as long as 24 months into the future.” That could complicate “peak inflation” hopes.\n\nChina’s economy is looking brighter. It’s not in the clear yet\n\nFrom big gains in tech stocks to robust trade data, China has had plenty of good economic news this week.\n\nThe positive developments come after the world’s second largest economy was battered by widespread Covid lockdowns, a sweeping crackdown on tech companies and a real estate slump. Consumer spending and factory output both shrank sharply in April, while unemployment has surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.\n\nAs China takes steps to gradually reopen businesses, and authorities introduce a slew of measures to stimulate activity, there are signs that a revival may be around the corner, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.\n\nRemember: Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing’s cybersecurity review of Didi was about to wrap up. The move would allow the ride-hailing giant to return to app stores in mainland China, almost a year after Didi was removed over data privacy violations. Chinese tech stocks leaped.\n\nThere were other signs Beijing’s efforts to rein in tech companies could be easing, too. Bloomberg said Chinese regulators have started early stage discussions on a potential revival of Ant Group’s public offering, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nChina also released strong trade data for the month of May, after a slump in April. The country’s exports jumped nearly 17% in May from a year ago, compared with only 3.9% growth in April. Imports rose for the first time in three months.\n\nStill, analysts say more needs to be done to repair investor confidence in China, and some big risks haven’t gone away.\n\n“It will take time to repair the business confidence, and sell-offs in Chinese assets might resume if China data proved to be disappointing again,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank.\n\nAmericans lost half a trillion dollars in wealth in early 2022\n\nSometimes, swings in stock prices can feel abstract. But this year’s market turmoil has had real consequences, erasing billions of dollars in Americans’ wealth.\n\nThe net worth of households and nonprofit organizations dropped half a trillion dollars to about $149 trillion in the first quarter, according to Federal Reserve data released Thursday.\n\nThat’s a notable turnaround from the robust gains in wealth that began in mid-2020, fueled by skyrocketing prices of homes and equities.\n\nQuick rewind: The Dow and the S&P 500 each dropped nearly 5% in the first three months of the year, while the Nasdaq plummeted nearly 9%. It was the worst quarterly performance for the markets since the first quarter of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic upended the US economy.\n\nThe decline in equities was partially offset by a $1.7 trillion increase in the value of real estate and a continued high rate of personal saving. The ratio of household net worth to disposable income remained near its record high and continues to be far above its pre-pandemic level in 2019.\n\nBut the data is a reminder of why so many Americans have been feeling lousy about the health of the economy.\n\nEven though spending remains robust, and most economists don’t expect a recession this year, the market sell-off has soured the overall mood as the value of trading portfolios and retirement accounts dwindle. About 58% of Americans own stock, according to Gallup.\n\nUp next\n\nThe latest reading of the US Consumer Price Index arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nAlso today: The University of Michigan’s early reading of data on consumer sentiment for June posts at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nComing next week: The European Central Bank’s hawkish turn upset markets on Thursday.

Investment was pouring in from around the world to cater to vacationers attracted by the popular \"Nashville\" TV series and the city's music and nightlife scenes.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2016, 20 new hotels opened in the greater Nashville area. The pace ticked up in 2017, with 19 new properties added. Last year, 20 more hotels opened.\n\nAt least 20 new hotels are projected to open this year, according to industry analyst STR.\n\nThe rapid influx of new properties has triggered signs of market saturation. But investors remain bullish.\n\n\"We're building more rooms than we're selling. I would expect that exact pattern to happen this year,\" said STR Senior Vice President Jan Freitag. \"But demand growth is tremendous.\"\n\nMcClung's Vastland Companies specializes in developing residential communities, offices and shopping centers. They debuted their first hotel in mid-January.\n\nThe 16-room Studio 154 features arched windows and pop art fixtures in an 1890-era Victorian brick building shared with Dick's Last Resort and Coyote Ugly.\n\n\"We realized there is probably a market downtown for something a little more unique,\" McClung said. \"Not everyone wants to stay at a Hilton or Marriott.\"\n\nAirbnb-style rentals proliferating\n\nNearly 6,000 new rooms have been added to the greater Nashville market since 2016, according to STR.\n\nOn top of that, more than 6,000 short-term vacation rentals were permitted at apartment complexes and homes throughout the area, to attract users of Airbnb.com, VRBO.com and similar sites.\n\nThe deluge finally absorbed record levels of demand that has spiked hotel rates year-after-year since 2013, putting prices on par with rooms in New York City and London. The rate of rooms occupied dropped by 1 percent in both 2017 and 2018, after years of increases.\n\nBut investors aren't fazed. Hotel owners still filled nearly eight of 10 rooms every day in 2018, and room prices increased overall – but at a slower pace than in prior years.\n\nLike McClung, investor Mark Bloom sees success in bringing an upscale, creatively designed hotel to the market.\n\nHe's part of a team building the 16-story W Hotel at 12th Avenue South and Pine Street in the trendy Gulch neighborhood, where a massive hole is now filled with construction activity.\n\n\"There is going to be a point in time where there is a slowdown. We all know that. I don't know if it's a year, five or 10 years from now,\" Bloom said. \"Our brand that we’re building, a high-end lifestyle property and our location will help us in more challenging times.\"\n\nRoom rates rising\n\nThe average room price in 2018 was $147.19 a night – up from $142.64 last year, according to STR. Rooms downtown start closer to $300 a night on weekends.\n\nConfidence in the industry is rooted in the city's incredible tourism growth, which has nearly doubled from 8.5 million visitors in 2008.\n\nIn 2017, 14.5 million vacationers arrived. That grew to 15.2 million tourists last year, according to the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp.\n\nNow, hotel owners expect another major influx of weary travelers to keep those numbers strong.\n\nAmazon and finance companies AllianceBernstein and EY are in the process of opening major offices downtown, promising to draw new corporate travelers. That will add to growth in leisure and group meeting travel segments.\n\n\"That's what I would call a trifecta of demand,\" said Scott Smith, managing director of industry analyst CBRE Hotels. \"All the hotels are maximizing their occupancy with this strong growth rate from each segment.\"\n\n'The numbers are promising'\n\nCompetition from short-term vacation rental properties promises to keep things interesting in the hotel industry.\n\nThe rentals have ballooned quickly, with new permits growing by double-digit percentages each year since 2015.\n\nSeveral downtown apartment buildings have partially or wholly converted to vacation rentals, including City View, the Dallas on Elliston, the 505, the Olmsted, 506 Lofts, and The James.\n\nNow, new buildings are being constructed solely for short-term rentals.\n\n\"It's still a growing and dynamic market,\" Smith said. \"Nashville has become a huge bachelorette party destination, and they're getting Airbnb rentals with several bedrooms and a kitchen. That is impacting the hotels.\n\n\"There will be a slowdown. I don't think it's going to be anytime soon unless there's a recession.\"\n\nDuring the city's New Year's Eve celebration, 17 percent of visitors surveyed by the Nashville Convention & Visitor's Corp. said they stayed in short-term rentals and 65 percent reported hotel reservations.\n\nMcClung's Studio 154 caters to the demographic with loft-style suites for up to 12 guests.\n\nHe's relying on his property's unique characteristics to continue to attract guests if an economic downturn comes.\n\n\"We use Hotels.com, Bookings.com, Kayak.com, Airbnb...,\" McClung said. \"The numbers are promising. The question becomes when are the tourists going to stop increasing. You have to have a unique niche in the market.\"\n\nHe's now considering developing more hotels.\n\nSandy Mazza can be reached via email at smazza@tennessean.com, by calling 615-726-5962, or on Twitter @SandyMazza.\n\nMore:Nashville tourism is bigger than ever, says city's marketing firm\n\nNever miss a story:Sign up for the daily business newsletter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/homes/us-mortgage-rates-march-31/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates continue to climb | CNN Business", "text": "Mortgage rates rose again this week as the conflict in Ukraine and rising inflation continued to weigh on the US economy.

For the latest news on the protests, view our live updates file for Wednesday, May 1.\n\nNEW YORK − Dozens of police in riot gear stormed into a building held by pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University late Tuesday after a tense day that saw Mayor Eric Adams warn that \"outside agitators\" would be removed from campus.\n\nCity police in an armored vehicle used a mechanical ramp to enter Hamilton Hall through a window shortly after 9:30 p.m., as hundreds of protesters below looked on or were arrested by police on the ground. More than a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators were taken away in zip-tie handcuffs as supporters screamed in outrage.\n\nProtesters described chaos in the occupied building and elsewhere. “We’re trapped in a dorm,” student organizer Mohammad Hemeida wrote in a message to a USA TODAY reporter at the scene. A video he shared depicted police in helmets and nightsticks closing in on protesters. “NYPD barricaded us in with batons,\" he said.\n\nWithin minutes of the assault on the building, Columbia University officials said they had no choice but to request police intervention.\n\n\"We regret that protesters have chosen to escalate the situation through their actions,\" the statement said. \"After the university learned overnight that Hamilton Hall had been occupied, vandalized, and blockaded, we were left with no choice. Columbia public safety personnel were forced out of the building, and a member of our facilities team was threatened. We will not risk the safety of our community or the potential for further escalation.\"\n\nAdams had issued a stern warning earlier in the day that students at an encampment needed to leave right away – and advised their parents to urge them to do so – saying “external actors’’ have taken over the pro-Palestinian protest and must be removed.\n\n“I’ve been saying for days if not weeks now that what should have been a peaceful protest has basically been co-opted by professional outside agitators,’’ said Adams, a former police officer. “Walk away from this situation now. We cannot wait until this situation becomes even more serious. This must end now.\"\n\nColumbia protesters are demanding the school halt investments with companies profiting from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, and they want amnesty for students and faculty involved in the protest. College campus demonstrations have been fueled by the civilian toll in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the Israeli invasion that followed a Hamas-led attack that killed almost 1,200 people in Israel.\n\nAdams said the right to protest would be protected, but argued the agitators were taking advantage of the demonstrations to \"create discord and division.''\n\nThe American Association of University Professors, Columbia University Chapter, released a statement as crowds and police massed in the area:\n\n\"At this hour, the NYPD is massing on barricaded streets outside the gates of Columbia University. Columbia faculty have spent the day offering our help to defuse the situation on Columbia’s campus and have been rebuffed or ignored,\" the statement said. \"We have been locked out of our campus and have demanded to be allowed back in . . . This is not new. Columbia faculty have attempted for the past two weeks to intervene in the situation, only to be shut out by senior University leadership.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"NYPD presence in our neighborhood endangers our entire community. Armed police entering our campus places students and everyone else on campus at risk.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Tuesday’s clearing of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University and the onslaught of officers came on the 56th anniversary of a police bust of a campus protest against racism and the Vietnam War. The university called in police on April 30, 1968, to clear five buildings occupied by student demonstrators, including Hamilton Hall, according to archives of the student newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator. Nearly 700 students and faculty were arrested, and more than 100 were injured, the Spectator reported.\n\n∎ University of Southern California President Carol Folt had a second meeting with protesters from the encampment on the campus, but no agreement was reached. \"We brought some very specific proposals that would address concerns they had about the endowment, which they have said is one of their most important issues,\" Folt said in a statement Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in having me issue a political statement in support of their viewpoint as opposed to coming up with practical solutions to resolve the situation.\"\n\n∎ The University of California, Los Angeles, has \"significantly increased\" security presence near a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus, Chancellor Gene D. Block said in a statement Tuesday. Block said the university has taken \"several immediate actions\" in response to demonstrations, including adding more law enforcement officers, safety personnel, and student affairs mitigators.\n\n∎ Seventy-nine people were arrested in connection with a protest at the University of Texas, the Travis County sheriff’s office said Tuesday. Seventy-eight of those arrested were charged with criminal trespass, and one person received an additional charge of obstructing a highway or passageway.\n\n∎ Officials at Portland State University in Oregon closed the campus Tuesday citing an \"ongoing incident at library.\" The school asked police to help remove dozens of protesters occupying the building. Last week the university paused seeking or accepting gifts or grants from Boeing pending a review of weapons sales to Israel.\n\n∎ Muslim leaders are condemning police removing the hijab from a woman who was arrested Saturday during demonstrations at Arizona State University, the Arizona Republic reported. The school said it's looking into the incident, which is regarded as a privacy violation for Muslim women.\n\nCity College of New York encampment cleared out by police\n\nThe City College of New York, a university within the City University of New York system, announced Tuesday that it is moving to remote learning starting Wednesday in response to the ongoing pro-Palestinian protests and encampment of demonstrators on the campus.\n\n“This encampment, however, poses significantly different and heightened challenges,” City College President Vince Boudreau said in a statement Tuesday. “Most importantly, this is not primarily a CCNY demonstration, and perhaps not primarily a CUNY demonstration. The significant inclusion of unaffiliated external individuals means that we don’t have established connections to them.”\n\nNYPD officers entered the campus late Tuesday after the university requested that police \"enter the City College campus and take all necessary law enforcement action,\" according to a letter sent to NYPD.\n\nVideos posted on X, formerly Twitter, by NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry showed officers moving into the campus in large numbers and ordering individuals to leave the campus. “If you refuse to leave, you will be placed under arrest,” police warned.\n\nAnother video showed police entering the encampment as demonstrators appeared to form a human chain. Officers also appeared to remove a Palestinian flag from a flagpole on the campus and replace it with a United States flag, according to a video posted by Daughtry.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram late Tuesday, the CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment urged the community to demand justice for “our comrades” and for the administration to meet its demands.\n\n“As for CUNY Administration- we will never forget the levels of violence and brutality you deployed on working class students of color while defending the most horrific of crimes- you chose to be on the side of genocide and violence, we chose to be on the side of liberation and freedom,” the CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment said.\n\nNYPD requested to remain on Columbia campus through May 17\n\nColumbia University leaders said they believe that the group that broke into and occupied Hamilton Hall was led by people not affiliated with the university.\n\n\"Sadly, this dangerous decision followed more than a week of what had been productive discussions\" with student protesters, they said. \"The decision to reach out to the NYPD was in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing. We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters who violate the rules and the law.\"\n\nUniversity President Minouche Shafik on Tuesday sent a letter to the NYPD requesting that police remain on campus through at least May 17 to \"maintain order and ensure encampments are not re-established.\"\n\nThroughout the day Tuesday, the city looked poised to intervene. A huge deployment of officers from the New York Police Department’s Strategic Response Group descended just outside the Columbia campus by late afternoon, a clear indication of law enforcement action to come.\n\nBy 9:05 p.m., police had blocked off both sides of Columbia University along Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. On Broadway, police in helmets, batons and zip tie cuffs stood by as streets were at a standstill in both directions. “This is a siege,” a speaker inside campus gates yelled from a megaphone.\n\nA message blared over a loudspeaker around 9:15 p.m., telling people they were unlawfully demonstrating and that they would be arrested if they refused to move. Large swaths of protesters formed lines blocking the fence leading into campus grounds. Within five minutes, police began to make arrests.\n\n'Sparked a national and even international movement'\n\nColumbia alumnus Dylan Stillwood, 43, wore a keffiyeh and stood in the rain near barricades after watching police buses full of detained people leave campus. He said his alma mater’s actions were \"disgusting\" as it called police on students for a second time since April 18, when police arrested over 100 people.\n\nHe had visited the encampment many times in support and described it as peaceful and informative.\n\n“It sparked a national and even international movement,” Stillwood said. “You can’t make a just cause go away through brute force. You can try to make it go away. But at the end of the day, I think something has changed.”\n\nColumbia says it will expel some students, suspend others\n\nColumbia administrators said late Tuesday afternoon they would follow through on plans to suspend some students and expel others as dozens remain in lawn encampments protesting Israel and its war in Gaza while dozens more are occupying Hamilton Hall.\n\nUniversity spokesperson Ben Chang outlined actions taken in the last day, including offering students to clear the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment'' by Monday afternoon or risk suspension. Chang said those who vandalized property, breaking doors and windows in taking over Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, would face expulsion. He also said protesters have created an unsafe and threatening environment for Jewish students and faculty in violation of civil rights laws, as well as a noisy distraction.\n\n“We are following through with the consequences. ... We are taking into account how daily life here has been disrupted,” said Chang, who reaffirmed the university’s commitment to safety as student demonstrators have escalated actions to what he called an “untenable'' level.\n\nColumbia severely restricted access to campus Tuesday after demonstrators seized an academic building and blocked the entrance with a human chain. The school also suspended graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest in talks with the administration that have failed to resolve the crisis.\n\n“Yet again, this shows the randomness and the arbitrary measures the university is taking against students,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nClasses canceled at UNC; protesters replace US flag with Palestinian one\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill canceled classes Tuesday afternoon, the last day of instruction in the spring semester, after police responded to a pro-Palestinian protest.\n\nThe school sent out an \"Adverse Conditions'' alert at 3:16 p.m. ET saying \"classes are canceled for the remainder of the day, and non-mandatory operations are suspended.'' Non-essential staff were told not to report for work or otherwise come to campus.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported student protesters replaced an American flag that flew on a large pole in the university’s Polk Place courtyard with a Palestinian flag, which police later took down.\n\nA university administrator led dozens of police officers to the site of a pro-Palestinian demonstration, where students linked arms and encircled the flagpole, video and photos posted online by the Daily Tar Heel show.\n\nEarlier in the day, dozens of protesters were detained as police began breaking down the \"Triangle Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" after school officials demanded demonstrators remove the tents and leave the area.\n\nNegotiations over occupation have stalled, student group says\n\nThe Columbia University Apartheid Divestment group said Tuesday afternoon that negotiations between administrators and the approximately 60 protesters in a campus building have stalled.\n\nPalestinian students, including a student-appointed negotiator, have been temporarily suspended in the past 12 hours, CUAD said. The group also said Columbia tracked which students swiped into a campus library during a certain timeframe as a way to identify student protesters.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators are worried about the university calling riot police to Hamilton Hall after protesters seized the building overnight, the student group said.\n\nColumbia protesters rally inside and outside gates\n\nHundreds of people rallied outside of Columbia’s shuttered campus gates Tuesday afternoon in support of protesters opposed to the war, near where students are occupying Hamilton Hall. The rally occurred by the only entrance to campus.Inside the gates, a few dozen demonstrators led the rally with megaphones, drums and claps as those outside responded behind police barricades while officers stood watch on Amsterdam Avenue.“We want justice now, you say how,” one speaker chanted, with the crowd replying, “End the siege of Gaza now. End the siege of Columbia now.”At one point, someone waved a large Palestinian flag from the top of Hamilton Hall. The crowd celebrated, and police drones buzzed above.\n\nBarricades, checkpoints, restricted access at Columbia\n\nBlocks surrounding Columbia's campus in Manhattan were a maze of metal barricades Tuesday afternoon as the administration’s closure of campus dragged on.\n\nStudents with dorms on campus asked security guards at checkpoints whether they would be allowed back in if they left, and some faculty members complained they could not access campus Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice officers looked on as a group of pro-Palestinian protesters led rounds of chants outside the school’s ornate gates around 1:30 p.m. A smaller group of counterdemonstrators also held signs denouncing Hamas and calling for Israeli hostages to be released.\n\nUniversity threatens to expel students occupying building\n\nColumbia's administration said Tuesday afternoon its top priority is restoring safety and order on campus. Spokesperson Ben Chang said protesters have chosen to escalate actions to an “untenable situation” by vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows and blocking entrances to Hamilton Hall. The student encampment, in the center of campus, still remained Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“Students occupying the building face expulsion,” he said in an update. “Protesters were informed that their participation in the encampment violated numerous university policies. We gave everyone at the encampment the opportunity to leave peacefully.”\n\nStudents who didn’t commit to terms, which were distributed Monday, are now being suspended. Seniors are ineligible to graduate. Commencement ceremonies are still set for May 15.\n\n“This is about responding to the actions of the protesters, not their cause,” Chang said.\n\nWhite House denounces protest occupations\n\nThe White House on Tuesday condemned the surge in protests that seize and occupy university buildings, which includes not only Columbia but also Cal Poly Humboldt in Northern California, where an occupation was broken up Tuesday.\n\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said the Biden administration was monitoring the escalating protests on U.S. campuses. \"The president believes that forcibly taking over a building on campus is absolutely the wrong approach. That is not an example of peaceful protests,\" Kirby said at a briefing.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement that Biden has always condemned \"repugnant, antisemitic smears and violent rhetoric,\" adding that Biden respects freedom of expression but believes protests must be lawful. \"Forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful, it is wrong. And hate speech and hate symbols have no place in America,\" Bates said.\n\nOrganizers say protesters are peacefully supporting Palestinians and that some Jewish students have joined their movement. But there has been evidence of antisemitic sentiment and even calls to violence among some of the chants and signs, creating a hostile environment that prompted Columbia to offer classes remotely. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained of \"antisemitic mobs'' taking over schools, while Hamas called the demonstrations a \"rejection of the genocide'' of Palestinians.\n\nSchumer rips campus protests that 'veer into criminality'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia during a floor speech Tuesday.\n\n\"Smashing windows with hammers and taking over university buildings is not free speech, it is lawlessness,\" he said. \"Campuses cannot be places of learning and argument and discussion when protests veer into criminality, and those who commit such acts are doing nothing to convince others that their cause is just.\"\n\nHe added it is \"unacceptable\" for students to be targeted for being Jewish or for protests to glorify \"the murderous and hateful Hamas or the violence of Oct. 7.\"\n\nSchumer − the highest-ranking Jewish official in American history − called last month for Israel to hold new elections. It was at the time the sharpest criticism yet from a top Democrat of Netanyahu's government and prompted blowback from Israeli officials and Republican lawmakers.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nEducation secretary: 'What’s happening on our campuses is abhorrent'\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona, speaking at a Senate budget hearing Tuesday morning, condemned reports of antisemitic incidents on college campuses and pointed to his agency’s pending civil rights investigation into Columbia. “What's happening on our campuses is abhorrent,” he said. “Hate has no place on our campuses and I'm very concerned with the reports of antisemitism.”\n\nCardona said the Education Department has more than 100 pending civil rights probes investigating allegations of discrimination, including antisemitic and anti-Muslim harassment.\n\nColumbia, like many schools, will likely settle its civil rights case with the department. In recent days, Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of pulling the university’s federal funding for failing to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. Experts say that’s highly unlikely.\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\n35 arrested at Northern California university\n\nCal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, California, said Tuesday its campus will be closed until May 10 after law enforcement began \"a series of actions to restore order.\" Two buildings were cleared and secured and 35 people arrested, the school said in a statement. Protesters for more than a week had occupied Siemans Hall, an administrative building that includes the president's office, renaming it \"Intifada Hall.\" The school dismissed freedom of expressions claims of the protesters, calling their actions \"criminal activity.\"\n\n“This is a difficult day, it breaks my heart to see it, and truly nobody wanted to see things come to this,\" school president Tom Jackson said.\n\nThe statement said the school made repeated efforts to resolve the situation and that \"this morning’s enforcement action was determined to be necessary to restore order and to address the lawlessness and dangerous conditions that had developed.\"\n\nIn Lebanon, solidarity with US students\n\nHundreds of students gathered Tuesday at university campuses across Lebanon to protest Israel's war, a movement participants said was inspired by U.S. protests. Students, alumni and other Lebanese gathered at campuses in the capital Beirut and elsewhere waved Palestinian flags and posters demanding their universities boycott companies that do business in Israel.\n\nRayyan Kilani, 21, who is graduating this semester from the American University of Beirut, said students had decided it was worth risking their degrees to show support for the embattled people of Gaza.\n\n\"Looking at the Palestinians in Gaza and students in Gaza that lost their universities, their lives and their families,'' she said. \"A degree would not matter to us as much as a liberated Palestine.\"\n\nJewish leaders call for more aggressive action against antisemitism\n\nJewish leaders on Monday urged Columbia officials to take stronger action against antisemitism on campuses. Kraft Center for Jewish Life hosted a Friday press conference featuring Columbia/Barnard Hillel Lavine Family executive director Brian Cohen, joined by other advocacy group leaders and students from Columbia, Brown University and Rutgers University. Cohen said it was \"sobering and disappointing\" that the events of recent days necessitated the leaders to speak out.\n\n\"The situation we are seeing on our campus and dozens of other campuses around the country stem from decades of decisions by administrators that have slowly eroded campus climate,\" Cohen said. He said students have a right to protest and to say things he does not agree with. But he urged schools to \"uphold your codes of conduct, enforce your rules and hold students who violate them responsible in real and consequential ways.\"\n\nPolice dismantle encampment at University of Utah\n\nPolice dismantled an encampment and dispersed protesters at the University of Utah late Monday after a rally that drew more than 300 people outside an administration building at the campus in Salt Lake City. Officers removed and dismantled about a dozen tents, stashes of water bottles, food and toilet paper as some protesters took down their own tents and drove away, the school said in a statement.\n\n“Utah college campuses around the state are not exempt from the significant unrest that currently exists in our country and world,” said Keith Squires, the school's chief safety officer. “Campuses serve as a stage and forum for not just students, but for members of the community who want their voice to be heard. We honor all voices, but the right to speech on our campus must occur within the confines of state law and campus policies.”\n\nColumbia suspends protesting students:Demonstrators take over university building\n\nWhat are college protests across the US about?\n\nThe student protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. In addition to divestment, protesters are calling for a cease-fire, and student governments at some colleges have also passed resolutions in recent weeks calling for an end to academic partnerships with Israel. The protesters also want the U.S. to stop supplying funding and weapons to the war effort.\n\nMore recently, amnesty for students and professors involved in the protests has become an issue. Protesters want protections amid threats of disciplinary action and termination for those participating in demonstrations that violate campus policy or local laws.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and Minnah Arshad, USA TODAY; Skye Seipp, Austin American-Statesman; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/03/iowa-governor-branstad-speeding/2487035/", "title": "Review of Iowa governor's speeding vehicle underway", "text": "Jeff Eckhoff\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nOfficials are reviewing speeding by Gov. Terry Branstad%27s driver and how incident was handled\n\nInitially troopers did not know SUV belonged to governor%3B SUV was not pulled over\n\nGovernor%27s vehicle was going 84 mph in a 65-mph zone\n\nDES MOINES -- The removal from duty of a prominent Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agent came five days after he encouraged Iowa State Patrol troopers to pull over a speeding vehicle that contained Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, records obtained by The Des Moines Register show.\n\nTroopers ultimately did not pull over the vehicle. A Department of Public Safety spokesman said officials now are reviewing both the speeding by the governor's driver and the way the incident subsequently was handled.\n\nA local police consultant said he would have expected the driver not to speed, and any troopers observing the incident to press for an explanation.\n\nFort Dodge, Iowa-based Special Agent in Charge Larry Hedlund, a 25-year department veteran, sent an e-mail to his supervisors the following Monday complaining about the incident, said his lawyer, Thomas Duff of Des Moines. Two days later, Hedlund was off the job.\n\n\"By Wednesday they had come to his house and taken his gun and his badge and his car and his cellphone,\" said Duff. \"It all happened pretty quickly.\"\n\nHedlund, who previously oversaw much of the division's work in northern and northeastern Iowa as supervisor of that region since 2010, was placed on administrative leave beginning May 1. He is still waiting to learn the status of his job.\n\nAudio files obtained Tuesday from the Iowa Department of Public Safety show that Hedlund first telephoned a State Patrol dispatcher at roughly 2 p.m. on April 26 to report a black SUV doing \"a hard 90\" on U.S. Highway 20 east of Interstate Highway 35.\n\nRecorded telephone calls have Hedlund calling out mile markers as troopers coordinated a traffic stop on the vehicle, which did not appear in computerized state vehicle registration records.\n\n\"Maybe it's the feds and they're making a movie,\" a joking dispatcher speculated while troopers were working to get into position.\n\nTroopers eventually set up a laser and clocked the vehicle going 84 mph in an area with a 65-mph speed limit. An in-car video shows a trooper at one point passed a school bus to close the gap with Branstad's vehicle, but he never ordered it to pull over. A communications log indicates the trooper advised that \"this turned out to be Car 1.\" By then, the SUV had traveled 15 miles.\n\nHedlund eventually was contacted by the responding officer and later called the dispatcher to report what had happened.\n\n\"As if my career doesn't have enough problems the way it is,\" Hedlund said with a chuckle. \"It was the governor.\"\n\nBranstad spokesman Tim Albrecht said the governor and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds \"were in the vehicle but were unaware this event had occurred\" until Branstad was told Tuesday morning that the information was going to be released to the Register. Public schedules show Branstad and Reynolds attended an event with Butler County Emergency Management officials in Parkersburg, Iowa, between noon and 1 p.m. on April 26.\n\n\"We have public safety professionals who drive the governor and lieutenant governor throughout Iowa's 99 counties,\" Albrecht said. \"We have great faith and trust in Iowa's law enforcement officials to ensure the safety of the governor and all Iowans.\"\n\nAlbrecht stressed that \"Hedlund's administrative leave is not related to his complaint about the speeding incident.\"\n\nLt. Robert Hansen, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, identified the driver of Branstad's vehicle as Trooper Steve Lawrence. The pursuing trooper who decided not to pull over the governor's vehicle was Trooper Matt Eimers.\n\nAsked about state policy regarding troopers violating speeding laws, Hansen said his department \"is reviewing the situation as part of a confidential personnel investigation.\"\n\nWilliam Moulder, a former Des Moines police chief who now operates a law enforcement consulting business, said officers in the field have wide discretion in deciding how to handle nonfelony infractions, but needless speeding is \"just not something to be ignored.\"\n\n\"I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if I were the commander of the highway patrol, I would have expected more than just waving him off,\" Moulder said, adding that a responding trooper in such a situation had a responsibility to tell his supervisor or ascertain that Branstad's driver wasn't involved in some type of pursuit. \"You would hope that they would not be doing high-speed runs just because they wanted to get home early.\"\n\nSpeeding official vehicles have been involved in accidents. In 2007, then-New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine suffered broken ribs and a leg when the trooper driving his vehicle was going 91 mph with emergency lights flashing.

The response to the attack in which 19 children and two teachers were killed has been denounced as an “abject failure” with enough blame to be spread widely.\n\nThe school police chief was fired and now seven DPS officers are being investigated for what they did – or did not – do. CNN has uncovered exclusively that Elizondo is one of those officers being investigated. A source close to the investigation also confirmed that to CNN.\n\nShe no longer works for DPS. During the summer, she was hired as a police officer for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, where her role is to protect some of the very same children who survived the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nElizondo declined to speak with CNN in person, on the phone or by direct message.\n\nFollowing this CNN report, the school district issued a statement announcing her termination effective Thursday.\n\n“We are deeply distressed by the information that was disclosed yesterday evening concerning one of our recently hired employees, Crimson Elizondo,” the statement from the district said. “We sincerely apologize to the victim’s families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused. Ms. Elizondo’s statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.”\n\n“Regarding the remaining UCISD Police Department employees, we continue to make personnel decisions based on verifiable information. An independent investigation is underway to evaluate the actions of the current officers on May 24, 2022. Additionally, we are awaiting results of a management and organizational review of the UCISD Police Department that will aid the district in taking informed actions to further ensure the safety and security of our schools,” the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Uvalde School District Police were informed as early as July 28 that Elizondo was subject to investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General for actions “inconsistent with training and department requirements,” according to documents obtained by CNN in a public records request.\n\nIt is not clear from the letter which actions were subject to investigation.\n\nParents recognized her\n\nCrimson Elizondo was clearly visible on body camera footage from Uvalde police released by the mayor. Much other footage has not been made public. City of Uvalde\n\nUvalde CISD has said it wanted to recruit 10 more officers after the May 24 attack. It did not specifically announce the hiring of Elizondo over the summer, though the names and photos of her and four other police officers, one lieutenant and one security guard are on its website, under the banner “KEEP U.C.I.S.D. SAFE.”\n\nSuperintendent Hal Harrell told a special town hall meeting in August that at least 33 DPS officers would also be deployed around the district’s eight schools. After initial concern by residents that officers who failed to stop the killing would be tasked with school security, parent Brett Cross told CNN he had been assured the deployed DPS officers would not have been responders to the shooting.\n\nIn her new position, that restriction does not apply to Elizondo. Children and parents walked past her as they headed into the school year at Uvalde Elementary, the new home for the younger students who survived the Robb bloodshed.\n\nAnd some parents, including those who lost children in the massacre, recognized her from the body camera footage released by the mayor, family members told CNN.\n\n“We are disgusted and angry at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s (UCISD) decision to hire Officer Crimson Elizondo. Her hiring puts into question the credibility and thoroughness of UCISD’s HR and vetting practices,” according to a statement from family representatives.\n\nIt made them feel uneasy, CNN has learned, yet another reminder of the deadly day in a town that is full of such reminders.\n\nBut they did not know that she was under investigation.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the school district knew of the investigation when she was hired.\n\nThe statement from family representatives calls for all department officers to be suspended pending a third-party investigation, and its results “must be released” to the public as well as families of the victims.\n\n“Our children have been taken from us. We will not stop fighting until we have answers and we ensure the safety of the children in our community is the top priority,” the statement said.\n\nCross, the legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, one of the children killed at Robb Elementary, says he is “disgusted” by what the district has done.\n\n“I’m absolutely appalled,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper and says the school board met with him and offered to pull such officers to off-campus roles. He says he will continue to hold a vigil outside the school board offices until all officers are suspended.\n\nThe district and its staff have not responded to emails and calls and a personal approach from CNN about this story.\n\nSecret scrutiny\n\nTexas DPS, the state body that helps local law enforcement in major incidents, announced an internal review into its employees who responded to Robb.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN that Elizondo is one of seven officers whose conduct is being investigated by DPS, but neither their names nor their actions or inactions have been made public.\n\nIn a redacted internal memo to the organization’s director obtained by CNN, DPS cited “actions which may be inconsistent with training and requirements” as the reason for the officers being referred for investigation.\n\nSources familiar with the inquiry told CNN that Elizondo was not properly equipped and said to investigators that she was not comfortable going inside the school without her gear.\n\nElizondo was briefly inside the hallway while the attack was ongoing but was not wearing body armor. City of Uvalde\n\nFootage from police body cameras and those of other officers seen by CNN show Elizondo arriving at the outskirts of the school as one of the first officers to respond to the report of an armed man at Robb Elementary.\n\nShe gets out of her official vehicle but does not retrieve any tactical body armor or her long rifle, as officers are trained to do.\n\nShe does not approach the school but stays with officers from other agencies outside the fence until a call comes over the radio, “Shots fired inside the building!”\n\nElizondo runs with other officers to the eastern end of the building that housed connecting classrooms 111 and 112. Soon after, the responding officers are told that the shooter is contained in a room on the west side.\n\nAfter that, there plays out on the recordings the more than one hour of confusion and delay before anyone goes to help the trapped staff and students in rooms 111 and 112, the catalog of errors that has become part of the Uvalde tragedy.\n\nElizondo walked inside the building briefly but mostly stood outside.\n\nAs officers prepared for what became the final breach, she offered to help a colleague and went to gather supplies for him. She was away from the school when the gunman was shot and killed.\n\nWithin moments, the body camera recordings show, the hallway where so many had stood became a scene of carnage as officers got students out of the classrooms and assessed their injuries.\n\nElizondo was soon there, urging students to “go, go, go” if they were able, and not to look at their injuries or the blood on the floor. She comforted one boy as an officer checked his wounds, telling him time and again that she was there with him, that he would be OK and that his parents would soon be told.\n\nThe footage showed she traveled to the hospital in a school bus with students who were shot and traumatized, again helping to take care of them.\n\nDPS director Col. Steven McCraw said in August: “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy.”\n\nTwo weeks later official notes of a meeting showed McCraw telling captains, “No one is losing their jobs.” McCraw told CNN he had been misquoted in the minutes and vowed “no one gets a pass.”\n\nElizondo, on the right in her new UCISD uniform, declined to talk to CNN. CNN\n\nHe said he would release all the information when he could, but the local district attorney has asked him not to do so until the criminal investigations are completed, a process he has acknowledged could take years.\n\nProsecutor Christina Mitchell Busbee will charge anyone who has committed a crime at Robb Elementary, including law enforcement officers, she’s said.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Public Safety, which declined to comment for this story.\n\nA coalition of news organizations including CNN is suing the DPS for records relating to the investigation that have been withheld from the media and public.\n\nSo far, the only person known to have lost their job over the response to the shooting has been school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who was fired by the school board in August. Arredondo became the figurehead of the failed response, though he has said he did not consider himself the incident commander and has called to be reinstated.\n\nElizondo earned a base salary of $59,715 at DPS, according to a database compiled by The Texas Tribune, reflecting a 12% raise a year ago. She joined the department in 2018.\n\nHer new salary is not known, but a job posting for a similar role has a lower salary range, from $41,584 to $59,158.\n\nThat posting lists mental and physical demands of the position, including an “Ability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons … under intense threatening conditions.”\n\nOn May 24, as she rode the school bus back to Robb Elementary from the hospital, she told another officer: “Nothing could prepare you for what they brought out. It was horrible.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Matthew J. Friedman Rachel Clarke", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Matthew J.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

But in other cases it has proved inconsistent, according to accounts from alarmed drivers using the software. Telsa says that “full self-driving” requires an attentive driver who is ready to take full control of the car at any time.\n\n“Full self-driving” has been capable of rolling through stop signs since the release of the first version in October 2020. Tesla decided to disable the function following meetings this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates motor vehicles.\n\n“The Vehicle Safety Act prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including intentional design choices that are unsafe. If the information shows that a safety risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately,” the administration said in a statement.\n\nTesla will disable the function as soon as this month in an updated version of “full self-driving” software that’s released over the internet, according to a document the automaker filed. Drivers won’t need to take their vehicles to be serviced.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe recalled feature, called “rolling stop,” allowed vehicles to travel through all-way stop intersections at up to 5.6 mph under certain conditions. Drivers had to set their vehicle to a “full self-driving” style that included the feature. The vehicle’s “chill” setting, the setting a user can select that drives the most conservatively of the options Tesla gives drivers, is not described as including the feature. The other settings, “average” and “assertive,” include the feature.\n\nThe “rolling stop” function also required that no relevant moving cars or pedestrian or bicyclists were detected near the intersection. The function wouldn’t activate without sufficient visibility, and all roads entering the intersection need to have a speed limit of no more than 30 mph.\n\n“If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop,” the recall document states.\n\nTesla said that it is not aware of any collisions, injuries or fatalities related to the feature.\n\nThe US government has been more proactive of late in taking action on new car features that may introduce safety risks. Tesla said in December that it would no longer allow people to play video games on the touchscreens of its vehicles while they are in motion, following a NHTSA investigation.\n\nThe US government does not currently have any performance standards for driver-assist features like Tesla’s “full self-driving.” It launched an investigation last year into Teslas rear-ending emergency vehicles while using the automaker’s more rudimentary driver-assist software, Autopilot.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/business/tesla-recall-boombox/index.html", "title": "Tesla Boombox recall: Elon Musk blames 'fun police' for recall of ...", "text": "1.

But years after his self-imposed deadlines have blown by, it still hasn’t happened. Even when equipped with a $15,000 technology package that is literally called “Full Self Driving Capability,” a Tesla car can’t actually drive by itself.\n\nNow, lawyers for Tesla are arguing that while the company may have failed to live up to these lofty goals, that doesn’t mean it perpetuated a fraud, as alleged in a class-action lawsuit filed in September.\n\n“Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,” Tesla’s lawyers wrote in a November 28 court filing, asking that the suit be dismissed.\n\nThe lawsuit cited numerous times when Musk and others at Tesla had stated that, within a year or two, the cars would be fully self-driving thanks to software updates. For instance, in a 2016 Tweet, Musk stated that a Tesla car would be able to drive itself across the United States “by next year,” the suit said.\n\nLater that year, Tesla published a video, also cited in the lawsuit, which the automaker said showed one of its cars driving itself. The video was misleading, the lawsuit said, because according to Tesla employees involved in the video, numerous attempts had to be made before the car could be shown to maneuver through the route without obvious problems.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the California firm of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, also cited numerous cases of crashes involving the use of Tesla’s driver assist technology.\n\nEven among Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, a type of technology now widely available from many automakers, Tesla’s Autopilot system falls behind those now available in global markets from other companies including Mercedes-Benz and Honda, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAutopilot is Tesla’s name for it’s driver assistance system that helps keep the car in its lane on a highway. It is supposed to allow it to automatically avoid other cars, though it has had significant issues seeing stopped emergency vehicles on the side of the road. Tesla has said the system is designed to respond to moving vehicles, since reacting to non-moving objects could be dangerous. it can also change lanes while avoiding other cars.\n\nMany other car companies offer similar systems. The name Autopilot has come under criticism from safety groups and even governments for implying too great a degree of independent control. Tesla and Musk have defended the name because, in airplanes, the autopilot system still requires an active and alert pilot at the controls. A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla should not be allowed to advertise its driver-assist technology as “Autopilot,” although the complaint was later thrown out, allowing for use of the term.\n\nFull Self Driving Capability is Tesla’s name for an additional system that, in limited release beta versions, allowed the car to independently handle steering, braking and accelerating in more complex environments such as city streets. According to Tesla’s Website, the feature no longer handles steering on city streets but only the gas and brakes.\n\nTesla and Musk have said that, with future software improvements that will be delivered “over the air” like smartphone updates, cars with these systems will, one day soon, be able to drive themselves with no involvement from a person.\n\nThat is not the case yet, though, and Tesla has missed its own predictions about when this would be possible.\n\nJust failing to meet Musk’s own expectations isn’t evidence that anyone purposely tried to deceive consumers, which would constitute fraud, Tesla said in its filing. Moreover, according to Tesla, buyers should have been well aware of the limitations of these systems before purchasing them, based on Tesla’s disclaimers on its website and owners’ manuals. Also, Tesla said, the plaintiffs didn’t show that, even if Tesla’s systems were involved in crashes, they were involved in more crashes than an unaided human driver would have when operating under the same conditions.\n\nTesla also listed a number of other more technical reasons the suit should be dismissed including that most of the plaintiffs, who were Tesla owners, had agreed to an arbitration clause when ordering their cars so these claims should not be tried in public courts or in class-action lawsuits. Tesla also argued too much time had elapsed since the cars were purchased and that the plaintiffs hadn’t really been harmed by the fact the cars never drove themselves, despite the system being called “Full Self-Driving” and costing some owners $15,000.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/cars/tesla-teen-hack/index.html", "title": "Teen's Tesla hack shows how vulnerable third-party apps may make ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nA German teenager says he found a vulnerability in an app installed in some Teslas, which allowed him the ability to unlock doors, flash headlights and blast music. The hack highlights the relative lack of oversight in apps that some drivers can download to their cars.\n\nDavid Colombo identified a vulnerability in TeslaMate, a third-party app that some Tesla owners use to analyze data from their vehicle. He was able to access 25 Teslas that use the app, and he did not have access to steering, braking or acceleration, which could be especially dangerous.\n\nThe exploit did unlock a litany of potential unwelcome possibilities for drivers, the hacker said.\n\n“Imagine music blasts at max volume and every time you want to turn it of [sic] it just starts again or imagine every time you unlock your doors they just lock again,” Colombo, the 19-year-old behind the hack, wrote in a Medium post detailing the hack. Colombo said that he could even track the location of Tesla vehicles as their owners went about their day.\n\nColombo told CNN Business that he immediately reported the vulnerability that enabled the hack to involved parties, including Tesla. Colombo leads a cybersecurity company, and it is not uncommon for security researchers to seek out software vulnerabilities for potential compensation. Tesla offers cash incentives to people who report flaws in its software, but Colombo said he wasn’t paid as the vulnerability was in a third-party app, not Tesla infrastructure.\n\n(TeslaMate and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nCars, including Teslas, have been hacked before. But cybersecurity experts believe this is the first time a vehicle has been hacked through an app that has been granted access direct access to some vehicle controls and data. TeslaMate software is installed on a computer that is not the vehicle, and then accesses the vehicle through its interface for apps. Apps can delight drivers with services their car wouldn’t otherwise have, as well as create new revenue for automakers through app-related fees.\n\nBut cybersecurity experts caution that the auto industry must mature, as there are growing risks as in-car apps become increasingly common in the years ahead.\n\n“[Automakers] need to think about self-defending cars before self-driving cars,” Srinivas Kumar, a vice president at the cybersecurity company DigiCert who leads efforts to protect connected devices, told CNN Business. “If a car can’t defend itself from an attack, do you trust it to be self-driving?”\n\nColombo said that preventing future hacks will require collaboration between automakers, app makers and car owners.\n\nOne way to prevent a hack of this nature, he said, would be if Tesla more thoroughly restricted apps’ access to data and commands. For example, an app could be restricted to only be able to view data, such as whether the doors are locked, but not be able to unlock them.\n\n“In a perfect world those apps in an app store that you could download to your Tesla wouldn’t have access to anything critical,” Colombo said.\n\nThird-party apps are increasingly becoming available in new cars. Some newer models offer a limited range of apps on their infotainment system. Some Cadillac drivers can download Spotify, NPR and the Weather Channel, for instance. Newer Ford models offer apps like Waze, Domino’s and Pandora.\n\nTesla has not officially launched a way for app creators to add apps to its vehicles. But tech savvy Tesla enthusiasts have written about how to do so.\n\nMoshe Shlisel, the CEO of Israeli cybersecurity company GuardKnox, said that automakers should scrutinize apps that end up on their vehicles to ensure safety. GuardKnox is developing a way for cars to monitor their apps and shut them down if they’re doing something wrong, such as communicating to an off-limits part of the vehicle.\n\n“It’s a wake-up call to the entire industry,” Shlisel said of Colombo’s hack.\n\nHe expects that cars in the future will have hundreds of thousands of apps to choose from.\n\nGeneral Motors reviews apps and scans them for vulnerabilities, according to spokesman Darryll Harrison. Ford, which also allows a limited set of apps on some vehicles, declined to comment for this story.\n\nBut screening apps displayed on infotainment systems won’t stop a person with sophisticated technical abilities from running an app on a vehicle independent of the automaker’s approval. This could be done through a USB connection or an over-the-air vulnerability as occurred in the Tesla hack, according to cybersecurity experts.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released best practices for cybersecurity in 2016, but it hasn’t created standards for apps installed in vehicles. Neither has the auto industry.\n\n“Right now it’s open season,” Shlisel said.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/business/tesla-phantom-braking/index.html", "title": "Tesla owners complain about 'phantom braking.' Federal safety ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFederal safety regulators are mulling a probe after Tesla owners complained that their cars were stopping for no reason.\n\nThe issue may stem from Tesla’s automatic braking feature hitting the brakes when there is no need to do so. A spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the agency “is aware of complaints received about forward collision avoidance and is reviewing them through our risk-based evaluation process.”\n\n“If the data show that a risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately,” the spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough automatic braking features can help prevent accidents, they can also cause problems or even rear-end collisions if the system stops the car unnecessarily when falsely detecting an obstacle.\n\nAn investigation would be the final step before the agency would demand that the company recall the vehicles to fix the feature.\n\nIn October, in response to complaints to NHTSA from Tesla owners, the company issued an update to its automatic braking software. But the complaints have reportedly soared since then. The Washington Post reported that phantom braking complaints to NHTSA rose to 107 in the past three months, compared with only 34 in the preceding 22 months.\n\nThis is just the latest in a string of safety issues raised by NHTSA about Tesla. Earlier this week, the EV maker was forced to recall all 53,822 of its vehicles equipped with the “full self-driving” feature because the software was intentionally programmed to slowly roll through stop signs in some scenarios.\n\nLast year, NHTSA also forced Tesla to disable a feature that allowed occupants to play video games on the dashboard computer screen while the car was in motion. And the agency is also investigating numerous instances of Teslas in self-driving mode hitting emergency vehicles parked at the site of traffic accidents.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe growing number of complaints about the automaker led Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts to criticize Tesla.\n\n“Although automated driving and driver assistance systems have the potential to enhance safety, they must be implemented with strong safeguards that will ensure our cars follow the rules of the road and drivers are fully engaged,” said the statement from the two Democratic senators. “We commend NHTSA for its ongoing work to investigate the situation and urge it to continue taking all appropriate action to protect all users of the road.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/cars/tesla-recall/index.html", "title": "Tesla recalls 1.1 million cars for windows that can 'pinch' | CNN ...", "text": "1.

Wade repeal", "text": "Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, Olivia Rodrigo and Megan Thee Stallion used the stage at Glastonbury Festival as their platform to vent.\n\nJanelle Monae turned her presenting gig at the BET Awards into an opportunity to voice her concern.\n\nHalsey spoke passionately during her live performances and artists including Pink, Lizzo and Eminem tweeted messages filled with fury, sadness, vows to keep fighting and financial pledges to Planned Parenthood.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade after 50 years, which negated the constitutional right to an abortion, netted a swift reaction from the music community.\n\nSome artists quickly spun their concern into new music: Ani DiFranco and Pearl Jam’s Stone Gossard released “Disorders” and Promise of the Real’s Lukas Nelson (son of Willie) unveiled a harrowing ballad about a trio forced to have babies despite extreme circumstances such as incest and date rape.\n\nRoe v. Wade reaction: Celebrities voice their concerns\n\nArtists tackling the topics of reproductive rights and abortion isn’t new. Some major mainstream hits – Madonna’s “Papa Don’t Preach,” Paul Anka’s “(You’re) Having My Baby,” the Goo Goo Dolls’ “Slide” – vary in their levels of blatant discussion about pregnancy.\n\nHere are 10 songs that delve into the emotions associated with reproductive decisions. From regret to relief, fear to anger, they are all complicated:.\n\nCyndi Lauper, ‘Sally’s Pigeons’ (1993)\n\nLauper’s striking voice colors a tale about a young woman with a “pirate smile” who underwent a back-alley abortion and died as a result. Co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter, the gently pulsing ballad from Lauper’s “Hat Full of Stars” album resonates with Lauper’s vivid storytelling: “She left one night with just a nod, was lost from some back-alley job / I close my eyes and Sally’s pigeons fly / She never saw those birds again.” Lauper rerecorded the song following the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nSeals and Crofts, ‘Unborn Child’ (1974)\n\nAn anti-abortion presentation from Jim Seals and Dash Crofts, who previously scored immense radio play with “Summer Breeze” and “Diamond Girl.” The title track to Seals & Crofts’ 1974 album damaged the duo’s popularity and stalled at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 after many fans boycotted the release on radio. The jaunty brass and squealing guitar in the soft-rock song – based on a poem written by the wife of the group’s recording engineer – are sometimes incongruous to lyrics that include, “Oh unborn child, beginning to grow inside your momma, but you'll never know / Oh tiny bud, that grows in the womb, only to be crushed before you can bloom / Mama stop! Turn around, go back, think it over.” But there is no denying the group’s stance or sincerity.\n\nNicki Minaj, ‘All Things Go’ (2014)\n\nThe deeply personal opening track to the rapper’s 2014 album, “The Pinkprint,” unspools myriad personal struggles, including her fraught relationship with her mother, the 2011 murder of her cousin and ruminations on motherhood. In expressing her love for her younger brother Micaiah toward the end of her loping rap, Minaj references an abortion she had as a teenager, though she doesn’t offer details beyond the name of her partner at the time, “My child with Aaron would've have been 16 any minute … It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him.”\n\nStars spoke out on Roe v. Wade.But did it matter?\n\nAmanda Shires, ‘The Problem’ (2020)\n\nThe haunting duet between Shires and husband Jason Isbell finds the couple swapping lyrics about the confusion and sorrow facing a young woman after she decides to have an abortion. “What do you want to do? I’m scared to even say the truth / This has been the hardest year / Is it even legal here?” they sing in the contemplative piano ballad, which also offers unyielding support (“It’s gonna be alright / I’m on your side”). In 2021, Shires released a modified version of the song to reflect her own experience of seeking an abortion. Called “Our Problem,” the alt-country track showcases Cyndi Lauper, Angie Stone, Sheryl Crow and other female artists.\n\nBen Folds Five, ‘Brick’ (1997)\n\nAn uncharacteristically somber song from the trio known for snappy, sardonic lyrics and pounding piano pop, “Brick” immediately courted attention. The song unpacks Folds’ jumbled feelings as he teeters between supporting his pregnant girlfriend through an abortion and his own ambivalence and feelings of guilt. “They call her name at 7:30, I pace around the parking lot / Then I walk down to buy her flowers,” he sings solemnly. Though the song attracted some controversy, it became the band’s biggest radio hit.\n\nSinead O’Connor, ‘My Special Child’ (1991)\n\nThe Irish songstress has spoken openly about her decision to seek an abortion in 1990 following a planned pregnancy. But the apathy shown by her partner solidified O’Connor’s choice. “I was left with the decision of whether or not to have the child, knowing that the father wasn’t going to be around. I decided that it was better not to and that I would have a child at a later stage when his father would be around and involved. I didn’t feel that I could handle it by myself,” she told Spin magazine in 1991. O’Connor’s lilting voice, strings and pennywhistle carry the song, while mournful bagpipes play behind her as she quietly sings, “You were precious to me, after all, I called you into being / I wanted you to know. Yes, you were precious to me.”\n\n'No woman is safe in America':Celebrities react to Roe v. Wade decision\n\nFleetwood Mac, ‘Sara’ (1979)\n\nOne could be forgiven for assuming Stevie Nicks was singing about a friend or muse with her mystically poetic lyrics. But in recent years, the Fleetwood Mac maven has disclosed that Sara was the name she’d assigned her unborn child with Don Henley, whom she was dating at the time. The couple determined they were not ready to have a child, leading to Nicks’ decision to have an abortion. The song, however, is only partially about the pregnancy, Nicks told Billboard: She was also friends with a Sara who became Mick Fleetwood’s wife.\n\nEminem, ‘River’ (2017)\n\nOn his 2017 album, “Revival,” Eminem is joined by Ed Sheeran in a loquacious song about cheating spouses. The rapper plays the role (he’s never confirmed if it’s a true story) of the other man who impregnates “Suzanne,” then tells her to end the pregnancy since they weren’t in an actual relationship. “I can't keep my lies straight / But I made you terminate my baby / This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled,” Eminem raps with escalating intensity.\n\nThe Verve Pipe, ‘The Freshman’ (1997)\n\nOnce the ’90s band climbed to No. 1 on Billboard's alternative rock chart with this guitar-buzzer, the suddenly dissected lyrics were widely understood to imply suicide (“His girl took a week’s worth of Valium and slept”). But decades after the song’s breakthrough, singer Brian Vander Ark explained in an interview with American Songwriter that the first verse alludes to a girlfriend having an abortion – though he was never sure if he or a friend who was also dating her was the father. “Now I'm guilt stricken / Sobbing with my head on the floor / Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no,” he sings.\n\nRobyn, ‘Giving You Back’ (1999)\n\nA personal account from the Swedish dance-pop singer who had an abortion a year before writing the introspective ballad for her “My Truth” album. “With you in me, I was beautiful / Two months of joy before the impossible / Every second I long for the day when you come back / come back to stay, when the time is right,” she offers. Fans might recall that her “My Truth” album was never officially released in the U.S. She explained to The New York Times in 2018 that the decision came partially because of her abortion-themed song. “You can’t really talk about stuff like that in America, or you couldn’t at the time,” she said. “Not if you were an 18-year-old pop star.”\n\n'I was thinking, wait a moment':Mormon mom of six writes viral Twitter thread focusing on male responsibility in pregnancy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/959062/celebrities-and-global-icons-who-died-in-2022", "title": "Celebrities and global icons who died in 2022 | The Week", "text": "The past year saw the deaths of several high-profile figures including Britain’s longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, as well as the former prime minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the final leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nAlongside historic world leaders, the deaths of several prominent figures in the field of entertainment were mourned, from the Scottish actor and comedian Robbie Coltrane, best known for portraying Hagrid, to Olivia Newton-John, famous for her iconic role as Sandy in Grease.\n\nAs the year nears its close, here is a reminder of some of the well-known people we lost in 2022.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

He won his Academy Award for Lilies of the Field (1963), in which he played an itinerant labourer who helps a group of German nuns build a church in Arizona.\n\nPoitier also starred in three box-office smashes: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, about an interracial romance; To Sir, with Love, set in a school in London’s East End; and In the Heat of the Night, which is now considered a classic. Having been awarded an honorary knighthood in 1974, Poitier received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.\n\nMeat Loaf – 20 January\n\n(Image credit: Keystone/Getty Images)\n\nResponsible for one of the biggest-selling albums of all time, Meat Loaf, who died aged 74, was a larger-than-life singer and actor, known for the power of his voice, and the sweaty intensity of his performances: it was said that he put so much into his spectacular live shows that he needed oxygen to recover.\n\nWhen it was first released, Meat Loaf’s A Bat out of Hell received hostile reviews, as did his peculiarly energetic style. But after he appeared on TV, pouring sweat as he belted out the numbers in a frilly tuxedo shirt, the album took off – and it has since sold 43 million copies. Another of Meat Loaf’s tracks, I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That), was a smash hit in 28 countries.\n\nWilliam Hurt – 13 March\n\n(Image credit: Mike Pont/FilmMagic/Getty Images)\n\nWilliam Hurt, who died aged 71, was once described as having inherited Robert Redford’s position as the “all-American blond Adonis who was neither jock nor jerk”.\n\nTall and lean with piercing blue eyes and a pronounced cleft chin, he conveyed a cerebral intensity, and had the “distinctive drawl – slow, nuanced, enunciated – of a stage-trained actor”, said the FT. In fact, Hurt was exclusively a stage actor until he was 30, and he often seemed “bemused, even amused, to find himself steering films in the semi-artistic side-currents of mainstream Hollywood”.\n\nDuring a heady period in the 1980s, Hurt struck gold with every film: he was the hapless lawyer in the erotic thriller Body Heat; and a scarred Vietnam vet at a reunion of college friends in The Big Chill. He won an Oscar for his role as a gay man locked in a South American jail in Kiss of the Spider Woman, and was nominated for his next two roles: a teacher in Children of a Lesser God, and a narcissistic TV anchorman in Broadcast News.\n\nJune Brown – 3 April\n\n(Image credit: Mike Maloney/Mirrorpix/Getty Images)\n\nIn the postwar years, June Brown, who died aged 95, worked in the classical theatre with the likes of Alec Guinness and Peggy Ashcroft. But her career had rather stalled when, in 1985, she was offered a part in a recently launched BBC soap opera. She was booked for just three months, but viewers took to the character of Dot Cotton – the gossip-mongering, chain-smoking, Bible-quoting manager of Mr Papadopoulos’s laundrette – and Brown was given a long-term contract.\n\nOver the next 35 years, Dot faced innumerable dramas, many of them involving her criminal son Nasty Nick Cotton (“Hello, Ma!”), and became one of EastEnders’ best-loved characters. Brown had been 58 when she joined the cast; she finally quit for good aged 93.\n\nDot was a querulous, narrow-minded woman at the start: in 1985, a critic described her as “a chorus, a latter-day tricoteuse, sorting socks as heads and reputations rolled before her”. But over the years, she mellowed to become Albert Square’s moral compass, said The Daily Telegraph.\n\nDennis Waterman – 8 May\n\n(Image credit: Ian Dickson/Redferns)\n\nDennis Waterman, who died aged 74, was known for his roles as “unreconstructed jack-the-lads” in three hit TV series spanning five decades: The Sweeney, Minder and New Tricks. Viewers warmed to his portrayals of tough cops and streetwise geezers, said The Daily Telegraph, sensing that they reflected some of the actor’s own personality. Waterman was certainly a “man’s man”.\n\nHe made his screen debut aged 11 as a kidnapped child in Night Train for Inverness (1960); in the same year, he appeared in The Taming of the Shrew at Stratford. He took the title role in Lionel Bart’s Oliver! at the Mermaid Theatre and played William Brown in a BBC adaptation of the Just William books. Aged 14, he moved to Hollywood to appear in a TV sitcom.\n\nHowever, it was in the 1970s that he became a household name, playing DS George Carter, of the Metropolitan Police’s flying squad, in The Sweeney; the series, co-starring John Thaw, was one of the most successful of the era. A year after it ended, however, he was cast in an even bigger TV hit: Minder. For almost ten years, he played Terry McCann, the hapless ex-con employed by George Cole’s used car salesman Arthur Daley. When Minder finished, he returned to the stage for a few years. He played the Soho barfly in Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell, and Alfred Doolittle in a West End revival of My Fair Lady.\n\nVangelis – 17 May\n\n(Image credit: Michael Putland/Getty Images)\n\nEarly in his career, he was in a hit band with Demis Roussos; later, he wrote the score for Ridley Scott’s sci-fi epic Blade Runner. But Vangelis, who died aged 79, will be remembered for the soaring music he wrote for the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, said The Daily Telegraph.\n\nVangelis’s theme for Chariots topped the charts in the United States, said The Times, but his score for Blade Runner, with its sinister evocation of a dystopian Los Angeles, was arguably even more influential. His later film scores included those for 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) and Alexander (2004). He also wrote music for ballet, for Nasa, for the European Space Agency, and for Stephen Hawking’s memorial service.\n\nHilary Devey – 11 June\n\n(Image credit: Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty)\n\nHilary Devey, who has died aged 65, became famous when she joined Dragons’ Den, the TV show in which budding entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a panel of multimillionaire investors. A businesswoman who’d got to the top in the traditionally masculine world of freight and logistics, Devey was only on the show for about a year, yet she made a lasting impression, owing to her no-nonsense approach, gravelly voice and distinctive appearance.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Devey founded her own freight distribution business, Pall-Ex. Her bank manager had refused her a loan, so she’d sold her house and her car to finance the company. The first couple of years were tough but before long, she had become a millionaire; and 20 years later, Pall-Ex had an annual turnover of £100m.\n\nDevey made her first TV appearance on The Secret Millionaire, living incognito on a housing estate in Rochdale. She’d seen poverty as a child, she said, but this was of a different order. That led to more media appearances, and to her stint on Dragons’ Den.\n\nDame Deborah James – 28 June\n\n(Image credit: Mark Waugh/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nDame Deborah James was a teacher, campaigner and podcast host who became known to the public as “Bowelbabe”. At the age of 35, the mother of two had been diagnosed with stage-4 bowel cancer; she was told that only 35% of patients at that stage live another year, and only 8% are alive in five years. The odds were terrible; but James was determined not to be a victim, said The Times.\n\nShe was offered a column in The Sun; she became the patron of Bowel Cancer UK; and she teamed up with two women with breast cancer – Rachael Bland (who died in 2018) and Lauren Mahon – to make the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C. It was lively and frank, and James was its “outrageous heart”, said The Guardian.\n\nShe also launched her Bowelbabe Fund, hoping to raise £250,000 for cancer charities. By the time she died, aged 40, it had raised almost £7m. “I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity, because it just means so much to me,” she said. “It makes me feel utterly loved.”\n\nNichelle Nichols – 30 July\n\n(Image credit: CBS via Getty Images)\n\nNichelle Nichols, who died aged 89, was a member of the original cast of Star Trek – and the only African American on the Starship Enterprise. Gene Roddenberry had written the role of Lieutenant Uhura (the name is based on the Swahili word for freedom) as part of his vision for a progressive future for America, said The Guardian; but during filming, Nichols noted that whenever scenes had to be shortened, it was her lines that got cut. “Eventually, I was down to: ‘Hailing frequencies open, sir.’”\n\nAfter one season, she was offered a plum role on Broadway, and decided to quit. It was a chance meeting with Martin Luther King Jr that changed her mind. Professing himself a fan, the civil rights leader told her that she was the first African American actress in a non-stereotypical role, one with “honour, dignity and intelligence”, she told an interviewer in 2011. “He said: ‘You simply cannot abdicate. This is an important role. This is why we are marching. We never thought we’d see this on TV.’”\n\nShe duly stayed on the show, and in season two, in an episode called “Plato’s Stepchildren”, Uhura and Captain Kirk (William Shatner) took part in one of the first interracial kisses on US television.\n\nOlivia Newton-John – 8 August\n\n(Image credit: Scott Barbour/Getty Images)\n\nOlivia Newton-John, who died aged 73, sold more than a hundred million records and sang some of the biggest pop hits of the 1970s and 80s. One of them, Physical, spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the US Billboard charts in 1981, and won a Grammy for its video, said The Times. But in the public imagination she will always be Sandy, the “chaste teenage prom queen” in the 1950s-set film musical Grease.\n\nNewton-John was 28 when she was put forward for the role of Sandy Olsson, the goody-goody, new girl at the local high school, who falls for John Travolta’s leather-clad bad boy Danny Zuko – and in the final scenes, swaps her demure frock and neatly tied-back hair for skin-tight black Spandex pants and a vampish bubble perm. She was worried she was too old for the part, but Travolta, who was 23, had fought for her to be cast, and in the screen test, she recalled, years later, “there was an attraction that kept the chemistry going”.\n\nBoosted by a string of hit singles – Greased Lightning, Summer Nights, You’re the One that I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You – Grease became a cultural phenomenon with enduring appeal.\n\nHilary Mantel – 22 September\n\n(Image credit: David Levenson/Getty Images)\n\nHilary Mantel, who died aged 70, started her first book in her 20s, and over the next 30 years she produced about a dozen novels. Most, she said, focused on the lives of “odd and marginal people”, and although they were critically acclaimed, her readers remained a “small and select band”. She was, she said, a “minority interest”. Then, when she was in her mid-50s, she decided “to march onto the middle ground of English history and plant a flag”. The result was Wolf Hall (2009), the first volume in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy.\n\nWolf Hall was the novel “she had been waiting all her career to write”, said The Guardian – and it catapulted her to worldwide fame. The book and its follow-ups sold five million copies; they were turned into a TV series, starring Mark Rylance; and Mantel adapted them herself for the RSC stage.\n\nShe became the first woman to be twice awarded the Booker Prize – for Wolf Hall, and for its 2012 sequel Bring Up the Bodies; and she was routinely described as one of the greatest novelists of her generation.\n\nCoolio – 28 September\n\n(Image credit: Frans Schellekens/Redferns)\n\nCoolio, who died aged 59, was one of the most successful West Coast hip-hop artists of the 1990s, and did much to bring the genre into the mainstream. He had several hits, including the C U When You Get There, with a melody based on Pachelbel’s Canon, and Rollin’ with My Homies, which featured in the film Clueless; but none matched the success of his ominous yet melancholic megahit Gangsta’s Paradise.\n\nCoolio claimed to have written the song at a single sitting, said The New York Times, after hearing Stevie Wonder’s 1976 song Pastime Paradise playing in the studio of his manager’s house in LA. “I sat down and started writing,” he told Rolling Stone. The first words that came to him were based on Psalm 23 – “As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a look at my life and realise there’s nothin’ left” – and became among “the most widely remembered” lyrics in 1990s rap.\n\nIn 1995, Gangsta’s Paradise topped the charts in the US, and across Europe and Australasia; it became the first rap single to sell a million copies in Britain; it won Coolio a Grammy; it inspired a parody, Amish Paradise, by “Weird Al” Yankovic; and on YouTube, the video recently notched up a billion plays.\n\nAngela Lansbury – 11 October\n\n(Image credit: Pictorial Parade/Archive Photos/Getty Images)\n\nAngela Lansbury became a household name in the 1980s thanks to her role in the series Murder She Wrote. The show, about a writer and amateur sleuth, ran for 12 years and made her one of the richest women in America, with an estimated $100m fortune.\n\nBut her career had begun decades earlier. Her big break actually came in 1944 when, aged 17, she was offered her first screen role, as the maid in Gaslight, for which she received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress, and an MGM contract. She appeared with Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1944), and was then cast as a music hall performer in 1945’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. She was only on screen for 15 minutes, but it won her a second Oscar nomination. In 1971, she was offered one of her most beloved film roles, as the kindly Miss Price in Disney’s Bedknobs and Broomsticks.\n\nLansbury carried on working, into her 90s, in film and TV roles as well as on stage, in a series of hit musical productions, including Sweeney Todd, A Little Night Music and Blithe Spirit. Even when – aged 86 – she was diagnosed with a hairline hip fracture three days before the opening of Gore Vidal’s The Best Man, she refused to pull out. Instead, she simply added a cane to her role. “It’s like being on a bicycle,” she said of her work ethic. “I just put my foot down and keep going.”\n\nRobbie Coltrane – 14 October\n\n(Image credit: Ian Gavan/Getty Images)\n\nRobbie Coltrane, who died aged 72, became familiar to British audiences in the 1980s, when he started to crop up in TV comedies such as The Young Ones and Blackadder. But it was his lead role in Jimmy McGovern’s dark, Manchester-set police drama Cracker that cemented his reputation as a serious actor, said The Times.\n\nCracker attracted audiences of up to 15 million in the early 1990s and Coltrane conveyed enough vulnerability behind his character’s brooding, bullying exterior to become an unlikely sex symbol, and he won three consecutive Baftas for his performance.\n\nJ.K. Rowling was determined from early on that when her Harry Potter books were filmed, Coltrane should play Hagrid, Hogwarts’ half-giant gamekeeper. The franchise would keep him busy for the next ten years. By the time he returned to TV in 2016, in National Treasure, a drama about a TV star accused of historical abuse, he was in constant pain with osteoarthritis, and had to walk with a stick, which limited the roles he could take. But thanks to the Harry Potter films, he was by then rich enough not to have to work.\n\n“The legacy of the movies is that my children’s generation will show them to their children,” he said. “So you could be watching it in 50 years’ time, easy. I’ll not be here, sadly, but Hagrid will, yes.”\n\nChristine McVie – 30 November\n\n(Image credit: P. Floyd/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nA revered figure in the rock world, Christine McVie, who died aged 79, was a member of Fleetwood Mac, and the writer of many of the band’s best-loved songs, including You Make Loving Fun, Songbird and Everywhere.\n\nMcVie joined the band in 1970 and would become part of the “classic” Fleetwood Mac line-up – alongside Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Stevie Nicks.

Trump!” they cheered — waiting for the former president to emerge from a private suite where he watched the annual in-state rivalry game that pits the University of Iowa and Iowa State University against each other.\n\nThe political gamesmanship briefly overshadowed the football game playing out on the field below as a mob of supporters peered around the glass windows, shouting for Trump’s attention and erupting into applause when they caught sight of him.\n\nTrump, who leads the Republican primary field four months ahead of the 2024 Iowa caucuses, hobnobbed with influential Republican donor and casino magnate Gary Kirke inside the suite before emerging to greet the fans who yelled his name and held their cell phone cameras aloft as he departed the stadium.\n\nMore:Trump, DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and other GOP hopefuls tailgate at Cy-Hawk football game\n\n“It’s cool that he came to this game,” said Brad Lewis, a Dubuque resident and Hawkeye fan who watched the chaotic scene unfold from a slight distance. He said that he currently favors Trump in the caucuses.\n\n“I'm a financial guy, and when he was president there was a lot of positives and a lot of good things going on,” he said. “And so, to me, that's important. People love him or hate him, but you know, he's done a lot of good things for the country.”\n\nSome attendees did boo and shout obscenities as Trump passed, but he drew far more eager and excited onlookers who appeared unbothered that he faces criminal charges in four separate cases.\n\nIn a nearby section of open seats, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — a top Trump rival — watched the game with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds and snapped photos with U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks.\n\nIn contrast, a source familiar with the arrangements said that Reynolds did not interact with Trump “in any way” Saturday.\n\nThough Reynolds has previously said she would not endorse any candidate ahead of the Jan. 15 caucuses, she has recently begun leaving open the possibility in interviews that she could do so. And her campaign trail appearances have been even more closely scrutinized as a result.\n\nAccording to a mid-August Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Trump is the favorite of 42% of likely Republican caucusgoers. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis follows with 19%, and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott is at 9%.\n\nTrump tosses footballs at gameday tailgate; Vivek Ramaswamy, Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson work the crowds\n\nIn addition to Trump and DeSantis, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum also attended gameday rallies and tailgates Saturday.\n\nAhead of the game, DeSantis joined a tailgate just outside the stadium as a pack of volunteers for his super PAC, Never Back Down, chanted \"we want Ron\" and \"make America Florida.\" He moved swiftly through the crowd, shaking hands and chatting football.\n\nMore:GOP presidential candidates flock to Story County Fairgrounds tailgate ahead of Cy-Hawk game\n\nRamaswamy joined fans in taking a shot of water from a Cyclone “shot ski.” And Burgum and Hutchinson, who have struggled to make strides in polling after getting on the first debate stage, made several stops, including mingling with U.S. Rep.

Joni Ernst at a tailgate around noon.\n\nTrump made a pre-game stop at the Alpha Gamma Rho in Ames, a fraternity for students pursuing a career in agriculture.\n\nAt the fraternity house, a crowd of tailgating students paused their games of cornhole and beer pong to eagerly cheer Trump’s arrival as country hits blared over the sound system.\n\nTrump pumped his fists as they chanted his name.\n\n“This is some turnout. I guess the youth likes Trump,” he said.\n\nTrump joined the grill team, taking control of a spatula and holding a burger aloft and displaying it to the crowd before turning it over on the heat. He moved through the crowd as staff lined up branded Trump footballs on the unused beer pong table, allowing Trump to sign a few and toss them into the cheering crowd.\n\nAfter arriving at the stadium, Trump signed more autographs and posed for selfies before heading inside.\n\nThe annual matchup between ISU and the University of Iowa football teams is a lauded tradition for both programs, and it has previously attracted presidential candidates seeking to woo Iowans ahead of the state’s presidential caucuses.\n\nTrump previously attended the game in 2015 as he campaigned for president, walking around the parking lots before kickoff and posting on social media that he was visiting \"Jack Truce Stadium.\"\n\nLook back:Football and politics collide at 2015 Cy-Hawk game\n\nThis was his first trip back to Iowa since breezing through the Iowa State Fair last month, where he was met with similarly boisterous crowds.\n\nSince that visit, Trump was criminally indicted for a fourth time — this time on state-level charges that he was part of a sweeping conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. He also skipped the first GOP presidential primary debate, which was held in Milwaukee Aug. 23.\n\nStill, he leads the field of Republican presidential contenders by a double-digit margin in Iowa, though he has campaigned here relatively infrequently. Trump has held just four public announced events this caucus cycle, though he’s done several more surprise drop-in events.\n\nTrump volunteers hold gameday tailgates\n\nBefore Trump stopped by the game, his campaign established its presence throughout the parking lots around Jack Trice Stadium.\n\n2024 Iowa Caucuses:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nVolunteers stood under tents decked out in Trump 2024 flags, handing out green koozies that declared the campaign \"back-to-back Iowa champs\" in exchange for their name, address and email. Trump came in second place during the 2016 Iowa caucuses, but carried the state in the 2016 and 2020 general elections.\n\nAt the Trump tent off Jack Trice Way east of the stadium, volunteers wearing gear for both schools waved pamphlets and koozies at passersby. \"I know you want one!\" one volunteer shouted.\n\nOne woman donned a custom Iowa jersey with \"TRUMP WON\" on the back, and the number 45.\n\nSome of the Cyclone and Hawkeye faithful cheered as they walked by; one man leaned out of the passenger side of a truck as it rolled by to scribble down his name and grab a koozie.\n\nNot everyone was as enthusiastic: One man in Iowa State gear shouted an expletive when he was asked to give his info. A woman in black and gold raised her middle finger as she passed by.\n\nDespite that, volunteers were optimistic about the response as they solicited potential caucusgoers.\n\n\"Lots of people signing up, lots of people are very positive for Trump,\" said Patricia Lage, a Spring Hill resident who signed up to volunteer for the campaign at the State Fair. \"Everybody's friendly.\"\n\nThe game kicked off at 2:40 p.m. Saturday, and the Hawkeyes claimed a 20-13 victory over the Cyclones.\n\nReporter Galen Bacharier contributed to this story.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Mike Pence has caught the eye ...", "text": "BRIAN SLODYSKO, Associated Press, AP\n\nAs a conservative talk-radio host in the 1990s, Mike Pence described himself as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.”\n\nTwo decades later, Pence is the unflappable conservative governor of Indiana who has caught the eye of another fiery personality: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nWhere the brash billionaire is impulsive, Pence is cool-headed. Where Trump makes conservatives suspicious, Pence has credibility. And where Trump struggles to draw evangelical Christians, Pence is well-regarded by them.\n\nA favorite quote highlights how Pence might smooth some of the sharp corners of the Trump campaign and its supporters.\n\n“I’m a conservative,” Pence has often said. “But I’m not angry about it.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe former congressman also is a proven fundraiser with close ties to billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch and their network of wealthy donors, many of whom have been dismissive of Trump.\n\n“One thing you can say about Mike Pence is he’s got a very calm, steady demeanor that in some ways is a little Reaganesque,” said Christine Mathews, a Republican pollster for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. “He’s a counterbalance to Trump in that way.”\n\nTrump’s decision, expected by the end of the week, would cap months of speculation.\n\nGov. Mike Pence to rally with Donald Trump amid VP speculation\n\nNot so long ago, their relationship was a little awkward. Trump met privately with Pence before Indiana’s primaries, seeking his endorsement. Instead, Pence, under pressure from national conservatives, tepidly endorsed Trump’s rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, while still lavishing praise on Trump. Trump won that primary. Before the night was over, Cruz had quit the race.\n\nFor Pence, a former six-term congressman, selection by Trump would offer a return to national politics after his embrace of the role of a governor of conservative social issues sidelined his own presidential ambitions. Describing himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,” Pence marched Indiana to the front lines of the nation’s culture wars. In 2015 he provoked a national backlash after signing a law that critics said would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people for religious reasons.\n\nEven some Indiana Republicans have questioned his decisions, suggesting Pence has at times seemed more interested in appealing to national conservatives than doing what’s best for the state. For example, Pence’s support of the state’s religious objections law led to a revolt from the business community, which joined gay rights advocates in successfully pushing for changes to the law.\n\nRaised in Columbus, Indiana, in an Irish-Catholic family, Pence revered the Kennedys growing up and has said he voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980. He later identified as an evangelical Christian and was inspired to join the Republican Party by former President Ronald Reagan, whose “happy warrior” rhetorical style Pence has since tried to emulate.\n\nAfter attending Hanover College, Pence graduated from Indiana University Law School in 1986. He met his wife, Karen, around the same time and twice unsuccessfully ran for Congress before taking a job at Indiana Policy Review, a conservative think tank. In a 1991 essay titled “Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,” Pence swore off harsh political tactics he used in “one of the most divisive and negative campaigns in Indiana’s modern congressional history” while calling for “basic human decency.”\n\n“That means your First Amendment rights end at the tip of your opponent’s nose — even in the matter of political rhetoric,” Pence wrote, though in the face of a difficult re-election campaign in Indiana he has since backtracked.\n\nIn Congress, Pence did not sponsor a single bill that was passed into law. But he built a national following among conservatives for his willingness to buck his own party after opposing President George W. Bush’s Medicare expansion and the No Child Left Behind education overhaul. During the early years of President Barack Obama’s administration, Pence helped lead the opposition to the Democrat’s agenda.\n\n“He has a particularly strong talent, a gift if you will, for being able to stick to principle while making his political opponents or those who disagree with him feel like they are being heard and respected,” said Ryan Streeter, a former Pence aide and George W. Bush staffer who is now a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nPence’s congressional experience is one trait that Trump, who has never held public office, said he seeks in a running mate.\n\nTully: Donald Trump’s new apprentice — Mike Pence?\n\nMarc Short, a former Pence aide and top Koch Brothers operative, elaborated: “He’s worked with (House Speaker) Paul Ryan. He’s worked with the team in House leadership. He’s somebody who has deep relationships in the evangelical movement, and he’s somebody who has foreign affairs experience.”\n\nPence’s one term as governor has drawn mixed reaction, and he has managed to alienate moderate Republicans over social issues.\n\nGroups threatened boycotts over last year’s religious objections law. Late-night television hosts mocked the policy, and a coalition of gay-rights supporters and business interests successfully demanded that lawmakers approve changes.\n\nThis year Pence clashed with the local Catholic archdiocese by opposing the settlement of Syrian refugees in Indianapolis.\n\nPence was also slammed for the planned 2015 launch of “JustIN,” a state-operated news service that was ditched after critics panned it as “Pravda on the Plains.”\n\nBut he has also presided over Indiana’s improving economy and plummeting unemployment rate, which Republicans credit to the state’s low taxes, limited regulation and pro-business climate.\n\nTrump's VP? 10 things to know about Indiana Gov. Mike Pence", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Former President Donald Trump announces a White House bid for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

Susan Collins, R-Maine. \"He did not ask anything of anyone.”\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who has had a tense relationship with the president and pointedly declined to defend him during the impeachment inquiry, said he and Trump were \"friendly and cordial.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMeanwhile, another delegation of Senate Republicans met with Trump aides who included acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, said officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a private conference.\n\nThe Senate delegation included Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and other committee members such as Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nGraham also began laying the groundwork for a trial by sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seeking documents on the Bidens' relationship with Ukraine.\n\nNo final decisions were made, officials said.\n\nThe meetings came after a rough week for Trump during a series of House impeachment hearings. His ambassador to the European Union and national security officials testified about a Trump plan to extract a pledge from Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in exchange for military aid.\n\nIn the run-up to Thursday's lunch, Trump appeared to appeal to the Republican-run Senate in a tweet in which he denounced House Democrats who are pursuing impeachment as \"scum.\"\n\n\"Keep fighting tough, Republicans, you are dealing with human scum who have taken Due Process and all of the Republican Party’s rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in American History,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHe added: \"But we are winning big, and they will soon be on our turf.\"\n\nTrump did not define \"turf,\" but Republicans do control the Senate and would conduct a trial of Trump if House Democrats decide to impeach him.\n\nThe White House lunch meeting included at least two GOP senators – Romney and Collins – who have questioned Trump's dealings with Ukraine that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt was the latest event in a Trump outreach program to Republican lawmakers that began after the prospect of impeachment surfaced in mid-September.\n\nOfficials said Trump has probably spoken, either individually or in groups, with all 53 Republican senators – all jurors in a potential impeachment. Two officials discussed the outreach on condition of anonymity, citing the private nature of the meetings.\n\nSeveral administration officials have said they would not be surprised if the Democratic-run House votes to impeach Trump, albeit with no Republican votes. Officials also said they expect the Republican Senate to acquit Trump and perhaps dismiss the case outright.\n\nOthers said the votes for a dismissal are not there, at least not right now, and the White House is braced for an eventual trial that was the subject of the senators' meeting with Mulvaney, Cipollone and other top Trump aides.\n\nConviction and removal from office would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate; Republicans have 53 of the 100 seats in the Senate. That means impeachment advocates would need to flip at least 20 Republican senators.\n\nRomney said the president brought up impeachment at the start of the White House meeting, but not to strategize or seek support.\n\nTrump \"made some initial comments that related to the impeachment process, but it's nothing that I haven't heard on TV from him,\" Romney said. \"So, there was no inside story or some argument that he was providing for us.”\n\nTrump then opened the floor and asked the group of senators what they wanted to discuss and were interested in, a frequent request at meetings of this type.\n\nTopics included legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, vaping and flavored refillable cartridges and the proposed Canada-Mexico trade deal.\n\nSenators said they and Trump also discussed the proposed short-term spending bill to punt a looming government shutdown to the end of the year; Collins said she believes Trump would sign that plan.\n\nRomney, a longtime Trump rival, has criticized him for asking the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Biden. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, called Trump's actions \"wrong and appalling.\"\n\nTrump responded by calling Romney \"a pompous ass,\" while Trump allies described Romney as a fake Republican.\n\nThe two men also clashed during Trump's 2016 campaign. During the primary process, Romney cast the New York businessman as a threat to the Republican Party, while Trump branded Romney \"a loser.\"\n\nYet after his election, Trump interviewed Romney for the secretary of State job before nominating Rex Tillerson to the post.\n\nAs for a potential impeachment trial in the near future, Romney told USA TODAY last month that \"I will study the law and the facts and on that basis make an informed judgment consistent with Constitutional duties.\"\n\nAfter the White House meeting, Romney told reporters that his difficult relationship with Trump did not surface during the lunch meeting.\n\nWhen a reporter read back Trump's \"pompous ass\" tweet, Romney laughed and said: \"That's as accurate as it is irrelevant.\"\n\nHouse impeachment investigators are also looking into evidence that Trump halted military aid to Ukraine if it did not agree to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business interests in the state.\n\nCollins, a moderate Republican senator, has said she will not comment on the evidence unless or until it comes before the Senate.\n\nThe Maine senator has criticized some of the president's tweets about the case.\n\n“I think the president would be better served by not tweeting at all on the testimony,” Collins told WMTW-TV. “His attorneys will be representing him should this come to a trial in the Senate and that's the time for them to have their say on the president's behalf.”\n\nOther Republican senators at the White House included Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (a fierce critic of impeachment), Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Hoeven of North Dakota, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.\n\nThe meeting also featured Johnny Isakson of Georgia, one of at least four Republican senators who do not plan to see re-election in 2020. Impeachment supporters have eyed those retiring senators as potential pickups, though White House officials expressed confidence that the party is united.\n\nMeanwhile, future steps in the House impeachment inquiry are uncertain.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not provide any timeline for where the inquiry goes after Thursday's hearing, including the question of whether Democrats would begin to draw up articles of impeachment.\n\n“We haven’t made any decision yet,” Pelosi said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/politics/biden-midterms-pennsylvania-wisconsin/index.html", "title": "Biden tests his political strength in return to the campaign trail | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been celebrating Labor Day in Pittsburgh on-and-off for more than a decade, twice using the city’s parade as a testing ground while he contemplated a presidential run.\n\nWhen he returned to the city Monday, other races were front and center, including Pennsylvania’s increasingly nasty Senate contest. Yet over the coming weeks, Biden’s own political strength will be put to the test as he embarks upon his most intensive in-person politicking since before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, Biden heralded his economic record at events with union crowds. But he also hit back at “extreme” Republicans he deemed “Trumpies” as he endeavors to render the upcoming vote not just a referendum on his own record but a choice between himself and the chaos cultivated by former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Biden referred to his predecessor simply as “the former, defeated, President.”\n\n“It’s clear which way he wants to look,” he said. “It’s clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are. They’re extreme.”\n\n“Trump and the MAGA Republicans made their choice,” he added later. “We can make ours: We can choose to build a better America or continue down this sliding path.”\n\nEarlier, in Wisconsin, Biden sought to differentiate between traditional Republicans and those who have rallied behind Trump.\n\n“I want to be very clear up front. Not everyone Republican is a ‘MAGA Republican.’ Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know, because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career,” Biden said at Laborfest in Milwaukee to a cheering crowd of union workers.\n\n“But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division,” he said. “But together we can and we must choose a different path: forward.”\n\nDemocrats hope to flip two Republican-held Senate seats in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and their success or failure will be viewed as a key indicator of the party’s – and Biden’s – political power ahead of the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nBiden’s own political future was the subject of anxious speculation over the summer as the 79-year-old President suffered low approval ratings and a string of setbacks. Biden’s intentions remain a lingering question, though he insists he plans to run again.\n\nPittsburgh was where Biden headed in 2015 and 2018 as he considered previous presidential runs. Marching in the city’s parade those years, he was met with enthusiastic calls of “run, Joe, run.”\n\nOn his visit Monday, Biden swapped the parade for a union picnic with members of the United Steelworkers. He mingled with the crowd for a stretch before his speech, tossing a beanbag with kids and taking photos.\n\nBefore emerging into the crowd, Biden met privately with Democratic US Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke earlier this year that took him off the campaign trail, in their first face to face of the campaign.\n\nFor much of the summer, it remained an open question whether Biden would be a welcome guest with Democrats or shunned by candidates looking to separate themselves from a historically unpopular president.\n\nWhen Biden visited Cleveland in July to deliver an economic speech, Ohio’s Democratic Senate candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan, declined to attend. He opted to campaign in another part of the state instead.\n\nOther Democratic candidates declined to say explicitly whether they wanted Biden to join them on the campaign trial in the fall.\n\n“I will welcome anybody to come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time. As long as I’m here, if I’m not up in Washington in session, and talk about what Arizona needs,” Sen. Mark Kelly, running for reelection in Arizona, said on CNN, stopping short of directly asking Biden to come.\n\nOn Monday, some Democratic candidates appeared eager to appear with Biden. In Milwaukee, he appeared with Gov. Tony Evers, the Democratic incumbent running for reelection against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels. The Democratic Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, did not appear with Biden, though the President advocated for him during his speech.\n\nWhen Biden spoke last week in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, appeared alongside him. And Fetterman’s team confirmed nearly as soon as the White House announced Biden’s trip to Pittsburgh that he would be meeting with the President.\n\nDuring their meeting Monday, which lasted about 15 minutes, Fetterman pushed for Biden “to use his executive authority to begin the process of rescheduling marijuana,” according to a readout provided to CNN by Fetterman spokesman Joe Calvello.\n\nThey also discussed infrastructure and “the urgent need to ‘make more stuff in America,’ strengthen and expand labor unions, and put more power directly into the hands of American workers,” Calvello added.\n\nWhen the two men emerged from the union hall together, Fetterman raised his arms and pumped his fists. But when Fetterman spoke ahead of Biden, he used the opportunity to lambast his Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, for owning multiple homes and preparing crudités without mentioning the President.\n\nThe unofficial kickoff to the midterm campaign season has coincided with a string of policy successes for Biden and his party, easing some of the Democratic pressure surrounding the President’s leadership and political acumen.\n\nBiden hopes to use his recent victories to boost Democrats and avoid what once was viewed as an inevitable midterm drubbing. He is also betting the reminder to voters of the dysfunction surrounding Trump will benefit Democrats in November.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Biden chastised the state’s incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a top Trump ally, for downplaying the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, where Trump’s supporters sought to disrupt the electoral vote count.\n\n“Sen. Johnson said it was by and large a peaceful protest,” Biden said. “Have you seen the videos what happened that day?”\n\nSpeaking in Pennsylvania later, Biden questioned the patriotism of Trump-supporting Republicans who have questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n\n“You can’t say you love the country, when … you either win, or you have been cheated,” he said. “And that’s where we are now.”\n\nBiden’s advisers have laid plans for the President to travel two or three times a week in the run-up to the November vote. Because his presidential bid was hampered by the pandemic, Biden has not aggressively campaigned in-person since he was competing in the Democratic primary in early 2020.\n\nAt campaign-style events over the past two weeks, Biden has demonstrated an eager willingness for the trail. During a fiery rally in Maryland, he excoriated Republicans for standing in the way of his agenda, which he touted as transformational for middle class Americans.\n\nLater, during an official event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Biden called for tougher new gun laws, including a ban on assault weapons, and accused Republicans of fealty to the gun lobby.\n\nAnd speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia last week, in what was an official White House event despite the political message, Biden issued a dire warning about “MAGA Republicans” seeking to undermine American democracy, a speech he’d been contemplating for months as he grew increasingly concerned at Trump’s hold on the GOP.\n\nMonday’s events signaled a return to a more consistent theme for Biden: The importance of organized labor in building the middle class and strengthening worker protections. Biden’s endorsement from key unions have helped fuel his many political campaigns, support he is consistently looking to repay.\n\nIn memos and strategy documents prepared over the month of August, Biden’s team spelled out their dual-track midterm message: framing Republicans as extremists and promoting his own list of accomplishments.\n\nHis stop in Pittsburgh marked his third visit to the commonwealth in the span of a week, and his 16th stop in the Keystone State since taking office.\n\nAt his own rally in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, Trump sought to boost his endorsed candidates but spent much of his speech railing against Biden and the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nTrump labeled Biden an “enemy of the state” in his speech, delivered near Biden’s hometown of Scranton.\n\nIn Boston, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris echoed Biden’s message drawing contrasts with what the White House describes as “extremist” Republicans.\n\n“Every day, workers fight to move our country forward. And yet, we must recognize that there are those in Congress who are fighting to drag us back. In Congress, in statehouses across our nation, extremist, so-called leaders are fighting to turn back the clock,” she said during remarks to the Greater Boston Labor Council’s annual breakfast.\n\n“Let’s not let extremist so-called leaders turn back the clock. We know what’s at stake, we know what we stand for, we know when we fight, we win, we love our country, and all of this is worth it,” she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/mike-pence-washington-visit-capitol-hill/index.html", "title": "Pence signals a 2024 bid as he meets with lawmakers and delivers ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is no longer keeping his cards close, telegraphing in several high-profile moves this week that he is actively exploring a 2024 presidential bid and working to gain a foothold in Trump-fatigued corners of the Republican Party.\n\nThese speeches and appearances undoubtedly reflect the former vice president’s towering political ambitions. While a person familiar with his thinking said Pence has not yet “firmly” decided on a presidential run, he is spending the bulk of his time laying the groundwork and strengthening his ties to key players inside the GOP to ensure he is well-positioned should he announce a bid later this year or next.\n\nOn Monday, Pence threw his weight behind Arizona GOP gubernatorial hopeful Karrin Taylor Robson, whom he will rally alongside on Friday. It was the latest move in a proxy war between Pence and former President Donald Trump, who is slated to hold his own campaign rally on Friday for rival candidate Kari Lake. Ahead of Friday’s split-screen between the two men, Pence aides have circulated a past Facebook post by Lake where she dismissed Trump as “not my president” just days before his 2017 inauguration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pence returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since he left office to meet with conservative members of the Republican Study Committee, a group he once helmed as a congressman from Indiana and whose current leader, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, has previously identified himself as an early supporter of a potential Pence 2024 campaign. Pence’s visit came just a day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed to encourage other Republicans to challenge Trump in a primary if the former President decides to launch another White House campaign, as is widely expected. Pence also introduced House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at a “Young Guns” fundraising dinner on Tuesday night, per a source familiar, underscoring his efforts to maintain close ties to top Republican leaders.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a crowded field for president,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday when asked how he might confront a third White House bid by Trump. “I assume that most of that will unfold later, and people will be picking their candidates during a crowded primary field.”\n\nLater Wednesday, Pence delivered remarks in South Carolina, an early presidential primary state, where he outlined a path forward for abortion opponents in “a post-Roe America” – urging Republicans to slash red tape for families looking to adopt and bar the US Postal Service from delivering mail-order abortion pills.\n\n“As we gather tonight, we must recognize that we’ve only come to the end of the beginning. Standing here in the first days of a post-Roe America, we must resolve that we will not rest, we will not relent until the sanctity of life is restored in the law of every state in the nation,” Pence told a crowd at the Florence Baptist Temple, stopping short of endorsing a national ban on elective abortions.\n\nThe former vice president has previously signaled interest in banning abortion in all 50 states, either through individual state measures or a national ban. Next week, Pence will outline his policy blueprint for Republicans, dubbed the “Freedom Agenda” by his group Advancing American Freedom, in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n\nEven as Pence lays the groundwork, all of these moves are happening against the backdrop of Trump’s own 2024 machinations and his public criticism of Pence both before he refused the then-President’s pressure campaign to block certification of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021, and in the year and a half since.\n\nPence works to keep Hill allies close\n\nDuring a private breakfast meeting near the US Capitol on Wednesday, RSC members thanked Pence for his actions on January 6 and encouraged him to run for President, according to multiple attendees.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, said lawmakers offered Pence encouraging words about a potential presidential bid, saying they hope he plays a big role in 2024 and that they need more voices like his in the party.\n\nPence responded with a smile, according to Bacon, but did not tip his hand about his plans for his political future even as he prepared to fly to South Carolina later that afternoon.\n\n“People said they hope he’s going to be a big voice in 2024. … He was being encouraged: we need more of you in 2024,” Bacon said. “And I would agree.”\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, a Washington Republican who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump for inciting the deadly insurrection, confirmed to CNN there were multiple references to a potential Pence presidential bid during their closed-door meeting.\n\nPence, however, told lawmakers that he is focused right now on helping the House GOP win the 2022 midterms and offered to stump for members on the campaign trail, according to attendees. Pence also handed out a lengthy booklet detailing his agenda and policy vision for the country.\n\nPence’s visit with the RSC, the largest conservative caucus in Congress, represents an attempt to maintain key congressional alliances as he explores a potential White House run.\n\nThe meeting also comes on the eve of potentially the last prime-time hearing from the House select committee investigating the deadly riot at the US Capitol. The committee has revealed stunning details about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence and others to overturn the 2020 election. The panel is still weighing whether to ask Pence to speak with the committee, according to members.\n\nBut despite a growing rift between Trump and Pence, Republicans on Capitol Hill had no qualms about heaping praise on Pence, a former member of the House who once chaired the RSC.\n\nRep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, confirmed that RSC members thanked Pence for his conduct on January 6, when he refused to give in to Trump’s demands to object to the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\n“Let me just say: the vice president is a real moral force in our party,” Barr said. “He’s a real true leader, and he’s earned the respect of Republicans and other Americans all over the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, who also belongs to the hardline House Freedom Caucus and voted to certify the election results, is one of the members who stood up and thanked Pence, according to a source inside the room. The comments were met with loud applause, the source said.\n\nOne topic that did not explicitly come up during the meeting was Trump himself, according to attendees. But Pence did praise the Trump agenda and talked up some of the victories they scored under the Trump presidency. Pence also brought up the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, attendees said.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short, who has testified to the select committee, was standing outside with Pence’s brother Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana and RSC Chairman Jim Banks, also of Indiana, who hosted the gathering. After the former vice president arrived, he greeted the trio and they all walked inside.\n\nLeaving the meeting, Short did not answer questions about Pence’s remarks or the ongoing January 6 investigation.\n\nAt the South Carolina church on Wednesday, Pence addressed an audience of grassroots and religious conservatives who, like him, have spent years working to return the question of abortion rights to individual states. It’s these types of voters who flocked to Trump’s 2016 campaign after he added Pence, the genteel former Indiana governor, to his ticket, and the former vice president is hoping he can regain their favor ahead of a possible White House run.\n\nPence previously spoke on the same topic last November at an event hosted by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion group on the political right whose president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, is a longtime friend and ally of Pence and has privately counseled him on the issue as he considers his future. That appearance came on the eve of oral arguments in Dobbs v.

From protecting the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortions under Medicaid, to de-regulating the adoption industry, Pence said abortion opponents should continue to work toward such goals now that the Supreme Court has ended federal abortion rights.\n\n“It should not cost the average American worker more than a year’s worth of wages to adopt a child,” Pence said, adding that “if you’re going to be pro-life, you need to be pro-adoption.”\n\nUnlike other Republicans who have largely avoided the topic of abortion since the June decision – many of whom are running for reelection in 2022 – Pence has been working to underscore his socially conservative bona fides by leaning into the issue of abortion.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Gaborr Melanie Zanona", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/28/st-louis-businessman-scheduled-meet-donald-trump-today/94538258/", "title": "Donald Trump sets aside 30 minutes for Missouri businessman ...", "text": "Will Schmitt\n\nWSCHMITT@NEWS-LEADER.COM\n\nWith numerous Cabinet positions still available, the co-founder of one of Missouri's largest private companies met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday in Trump Tower in New York City.\n\nNews outlets had reported as early as Friday that Trump would be meeting with David Steward, the chairman of World Wide Technology.\n\nThe meeting comes as Trump and his transition team are in the process of interviewing potential Cabinet appointees.

Why feds are taking so long to change old rules.", "text": "Marijuana remains in an odd legal limbo in the United States, and there's one organization at the center of it: the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe DEA has for decades held that marijuana is among the most dangerous, highly addictive drugs and has no medical value, despite growing state laws, medical evidence and popular opinion to the contrary. The result: Pot is widely available in some states, heavily criminalized in others − and technically federally illegal everywhere.\n\nThe confusion could be cleared up by Congress or the courts intervening, said Carmel Shachar, Harvard School of Law professor and faculty director at the university's Health Law and Policy Clinic. But in the absence of bold congressional action on marijuana, experts and advocates are looking to the DEA to make the next move to change the nation's position on pot.\n\nWhile many states and physicians have recognized marijuana's potential medical benefits, there are still health risks associated with the substance under study, including a possible increase in risk of heart failure and heart attack. The potency and lack of regulation around marijuana has also led to concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden has said he's one of the people who disagrees with the DEA's categorization of marijuana. He called for a review in 2022, kicking off a bureaucratic slog that could soon change the status quo. Here's what to know:\n\nThe DEA classifies drugs and says pot is the worst kind\n\nThe DEA says marijuana is classified as a \"Schedule I\" drug under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nThe statute classifies drugs from Schedule I to Schedule V based on their potential for abuse, addictiveness and medical use. Schedule I drugs have \"high potential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical dependence\" and \"no currently accepted medical use,\" the DEA says.\n\nShachar said, \"Cocaine, morphine, and methamphetamines are all Schedule II, meaning they have been determined to have some medical value. It feels very strange to have marijuana be more restricted than these substances.\"\n\nPutting marijuana in Schedule I also places huge obstacles in the way of doing the kind of research that would be needed to prove there are medical uses, according to Heather Trela, director of operations and a fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government out of the State University of New York.\n\nHealth risks:Is marijuana more harmful to your lungs than cigarettes? A study suggests it may be.\n\nThat has created a feedback loop: It's hard to study pot to prove its medical value, because the federal government says it has no medical value.\n\nWhy is pot classified as the most dangerous? No good reason, experts say.\n\nMarijuana has been a Schedule I drug since the statute took effect in 1971, \"with very little medical or scientific evidence to demonstrate why it had to be Schedule I,\" Shachar said.\n\nAt the time, it had more to do with \"who uses the drug than the drug itself,\" Trela said.\n\nIt was under President Richard Nixon that marijuana was added to the list under the most restricted category – first only provisionally until more of the science could be settled, Trela said.\n\nYet even when a commission formed by Nixon determined weed shouldn't be criminalized, it remained in Schedule I. Trela said Nixon knew marijuana was a \"drug associated with the anti-war protesters, hippies and people of color – none of whom were fans of President Nixon and his agenda.\"\n\nA top adviser to Nixon, John Ehrlichman, said as much in an interview in 1994 that was published by Harper's Magazine in 2016: \"Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\"\n\nWhat could happen next? Will the DEA change its mind?\n\nThe next expected development is considered a small step, advocates say: The DEA is considering reclassifying marijuana as a lower-level controlled substance, but that wouldn't make it legal.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction but, in terms of its practical direction, it's really more symbolic,\" said Morgan Fox, political director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the country's oldest cannabis legalization advocacy group.\n\nIn 2022, Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services to review of how marijuana is classified. Last year, HHS recommended that cannabis be rescheduled as a Schedule III substance, like ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine.\n\nIf marijuana is placed on Schedule III instead, it would mean it could be legally prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed at licensed pharmacies. It also could help resolve a massive federal tax burden that has been placed on cannabis companies.\n\n\"It partially sends a signal that the federal government doesn't think cannabis is the worst of the worst drugs. 'Not as bad as heroin' − that's a good thing for the government to say,\" said Jay Wexler, a law professor at Boston University who wrote the book \"Weed Rules: Blazing the Way to a Just and Joyful Marijuana Policy.\"\n\nBut practically, rescheduling wouldn't have much of an effect on state cannabis programs at all, Wexler said, and \"everything states are doing is still a violation of federal law, and anybody who's selling, buying, processing, growing cannabis under these state programs is still in violation of federal law even if it's rescheduled.\"\n\nThe DEA did not give a time frame for if or when an announcement on rescheduling might come when reached by USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nWhat would it take to make marijuana fully legal in the US?\n\nTo eliminate the stark conflict between state and federal laws, marijuana would need to be removed from the Controlled Substances Act list altogether. Experts say there's a chance that could happen eventually, but it's still a long way off.\n\n\"I think it's going to take time, but I think we will get there,\" Trela said.\n\nJust as alcohol and tobacco are not considered controlled substances but are regulated by the federal government and by states, descheduling cannabis could have a similar effect, Wexler said.\n\nA group of Democratic senators – plus Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but joins with Democrats on major issues – wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and DEA Administrator Anne Milgram last month urging the descheduling of marijuana.\n\nWhat's taking so long?\n\nPublic support for the legalization of marijuana is at an all-time high, national polling has shown. A Gallup poll in the fall found 70% of Americans support legal weed. In 2022, Pew Research Center found just 10% of Americans believe it should be completely illegal. Thirty percent support medical use only, and 59% supported legalization for medical and recreational use.\n\nThat public support has been bumped by Americans seeing firsthand through loved ones and news stories that marijuana can have medical benefits for people with illnesses who can't get relief otherwise, Wexler said.\n\n\"Why doesn't that translate into clear political outcomes to deschedule cannabis? I don’t know,\" Wexler said.\n\nExperts said a combination of factors may be at play, including a desire to move toward full legalization incrementally. Legalization is also up against a number of top-line priorities, and support from the public and lawmakers is not uniform, Trela said.\n\n\"There is still a perception by many and belief that this is not where we should be going; the government should not be encouraging drug use, in their minds,\" Trela said. \"We're not that far removed from the stigma of marijuana.\"\n\nAdvocates hope weed will be removed from the Controlled Substances Act altogether someday, but it doesn't look as if marijuana will be legalized on the federal level anytime soon.\n\nSaid Wexler, \"Rescheduling is a step forward, but it is not nearly enough. And there's no reason to keep cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/17"}]}

For the latest news, view our live updates file for Thursday, May 2.\n\nNEW YORK − Hundreds of faculty and graduate student workers rallied on a sunny Wednesday afternoon outside Columbia University’s only open entrance, protesting the university’s decision hours earlier to send police on campus and arrest more than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n\nProtesters held signs, including “no cops on campus,” as police entered and exited the campus gates just feet away. Others held signs calling for university President Minouche Shafik to resign. Faculty members said access was heavily restricted, as campus was closed for a second day in the period before finals, open only to students living on campus and essential workers.\n\nThe NYPD announced almost 300 arrests had taken place Tuesday at Columbia and City College − hours before Los Angeles police in riot gear swept onto UCLA's campus to break up a violent melee between dueling protesters as opposition to Israel's war in Gaza continued to roll through universities across the nation.\n\nDozens of the New York arrests involved demonstrators removed from an administration building at Columbia, where officers also took down encampments that had been the epicenter of the protests nationwide.\n\n\"Students and outside activists breaking Hamilton Hall doors, mistreating our Public Safety officers and maintenance staff, and damaging property are acts of destruction, not political speech,\" Shafik said in a statement Wednesday. She added that many students felt unwelcome on campus because of the disruption and antisemitic comments made by some protesters.\n\nAt City College, affiliated with City University of New York, officials requested NYPD assistance after the college said students and \"un-affiliated external individuals\" refused to leave. The school issued a statement saying students have a right to demonstrate peacefully but that police were called in because of \"specific and repeated acts of violence and vandalism, not in response to peaceful protest.\"\n\nAbout 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed and more than 200 taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The Israeli retaliatory assault has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and obliterated much of the enclave's infrastructure. The humanitarian crisis has fueled outrage on some U.S. campuses and spurred demands for an end to investment in Israeli companies and amnesty for student protesters.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ New Hampshire State Police said personnel were at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College on Wednesday night \"in response to illegal activity and at the request of local law enforcement.\" At the University of New Hampshire, police arrested 10 to 20 pro-Palestinian protesters who started setting up an encampment after a rally. Officers at Dartmouth College cleared out the final tents at the campus encampment shortly before 11:40 p.m., its student newspaper reported.\n\n∎ Several hundred protesters gathered Wednesday for a peaceful demonstration on Ohio State University. School officials had locked up some buildings in anticipation of the demonstration. Unlike last week's protest, which led to almost 40 arrests, the crowd began dispersing around 9 p.m. and the demonstration ended before 10 p.m.\n\n∎ Columbia Provost Angela Olinto said all academic activities at the school's main campus for the rest of the semester, including final exams, will be held remotely, with some minor exceptions.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he supports the strong law enforcement response unleashed on protesters at the University of Georgia and Emory University in Atlanta. “Send a message,'' he said. \"We are not going to allow Georgia to become the next Columbia University.”\n\n∎ Protesters and police clashed at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when officers broke up an encampment there Wednesday. Video from the scene showed some protesters being pinned to the ground.\n\n∎ Tulane University said at least 14 protesters were arrested from the \"illegal encampment\" the school said was dominated by protesters \"unaffiliated with our community.\"\n\nPolice order dispersal of large pro-Palestinian gathering at UCLA\n\nPolice ordered a large group of Pro-Palestinian demonstrators to leave or face arrest late Wednesday, a night after violence erupted at the encampment by counter-protestors.\n\nVideo posted on social media showed counterdemonstrators battering a makeshift barricade around pro-Palestinian protesters at the Los Angeles campus. The Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to UCLA's request to restore order \"due to multiple acts of violence within the large encampment\" on the campus.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported police did not intervene for more than an hour after arriving as counterdemonstrators wearing black outfits and white masks − some armed with metal pipes and sticks − repeatedly tried to breach the perimeter of the encampment while campers pushed back and several fights broke out.\n\nLos Angeles police said in a statement Wednesday that officers made no arrests and did not use force in its response to the UCLA campus Tuesday night. The department also noted that no officers were injured.\n\nUCLA canceled Wednesday classes and Chancellor Gene Block, who blamed the violence on a \"group of instigators'' who attacked the encampment, said the student conduct process has been initiated and could lead to disciplinary action including suspension or expulsion.\n\nThe Times also reported University of California President Michael Drake told the Board of Regents that 15 people were injured in the overnight fracas, and he's ordering an independent review of the events, including how UCLA handled them.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the violence, saying in a statement, \"The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism, or lawlessness on campus. Those who engage in illegal behavior must be held accountable for their actions − including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion.''\n\nThe Jewish Federation Los Angeles issued a statement saying it was \"appalled\" at the violence, which did not \"represent the Jewish community or our values.\" But the statement also said the UCLA administration was at fault for allowing an environment that made students feel unsafe.\n\nUCLA students barricade themselves in courtyard in tense protest\n\nHundreds of students at UCLA barricaded themselves in a courtyard between two campus buildings Wednesday, using sheets of plywood, planks, ropes, and tents to block the doors leading from the buildings into the outside area.\n\nThe mood was anxious. Sporadic announcements over a loudspeaker informed students they were part of an illegal settlement and would face consequences if they remained. In response, the crowd chanted: “We’re not leaving, we’re not leaving.”\n\n“I’m terrified, obviously, I think everybody is,” said 21-year-old student Aidan Doyle. “But we’re going to stay as long as we possibly can, until we’re being physically removed.”\n\nThousands of students were spread out in the areas directly outside the main protest. Organizers shouted over loud speakers that they didn’t need any more supplies as piles of protective equipment, pizza and Gatorade grew at the main entrance to the camp.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the camp was attacked by a group of violent counter-protesters, who fired chemical agents and fireworks into the protestors and assaulted dozens of people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nColumbia faculty members protest decision to bring in police\n\nSome of faculty and graduate student workers rallying outside Columbia's gates wore orange safety vests that said “faculty,” which they donned days earlier to help protect students in the encampment.\n\n“There is not a single university left in Gaza, and I bet a lot of you feel there is not a university here in Morningside Heights,” Joseph Hawley, an associate professor of classics, told gatherers, referring to the neighborhood around the school. “But I’m here to tell you the university is here on this sidewalk.”\n\nBarricades still lined city streets outside Columbia’s campus as police officers stood watch. Shafik has asked the New York Police Department to remain on campus until May 17, two days after graduation.\n\nMana Kia, an associate professor, read a draft statement from the Columbia chapter of the American Association of University Professors saying members \"unequivocally condemn President Shafik, the Columbia board of trustees and other senior administrators involved in the decision to call in the NYPD and clear the encampment of student protesters.\" The statement said the association has \"no confidence in the administration.\"\n\nOrganizer says 'ordinary people,' not agitators behind protests\n\nLess than three hours before a huge deployment of New York City police officers broke up an encampment and retook a building at Columbia on Tuesday night, Mayor Eric Adams made a forceful case that the pro-Palestinian protest at the school had been hijacked by \"outside agitators'' bent on sowing chaos.\n\nThose involved in pushing for the movement off-campus disagree, saying it belongs to regular folks trying to raise awareness to the Palestinians' plight.\n\nManolo De Los Santos, an organizer with The People’s Forum, said those joining the protests alongside students are just “ordinary New Yorkers.”“The power of this moment is that it’s everyone coming together,” he said. “It’s health care workers, it’s teachers, it’s city workers. It’s ordinary people who feel so strongly.”\n\n‘Never felt this much tension on campus,' UNH student says\n\nPolice arrested pro-Palestinian protesters who started setting up an encampment in front of the University of New Hampshire's Thompson Hall Wednesday night.\n\nUNH Police Chief Paul Dean estimated between 10 to 20 protesters were arrested after a rally led to demonstrators attempting to set up an encampment at the state’s flagship university, drawing local and New Hampshire State Police. Some demonstrators shouted at officers, calling them \"cowards\" and chanting \"free Palestine.\"\n\nThe peaceful rally lasted until around 6:30 p.m. Then, Dean said protesters rushed in to form an encampment and attempted to barricade their tents. Leftover tents and items on Thompson Hall's lawn were removed by police around 9 p.m., loaded onto a truck as dozens of students watched.\n\nShane Tilton, a sophomore who lives in a nearby residence hall, said he walked over to observe after hearing the commotion. He watched from beneath the Thompson Hall arches as the encampment was removed from the most well-known gathering spot on campus.\n\n“I’ve never felt this much tension on campus,” Tilton said. “I feel like there’s a lot of tension. From my perspective, it seems like the cops don’t have much to do here. They seemed like they were here to jump at this opportunity and see some action.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire condemned police’s actions Wednesday night in Durham and at a similar protest at Dartmouth College in Hanover.\n\n“Freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate are foundational principles of democracy and core constitutional rights,\" said Devon Chaffee, executive director of the state ACLU. \"We urge university and government leaders to create environments that safeguard constitutionally protected speech.\"\n\n– Ian Lenahan and Deb Cram, Portsmouth Herald\n\n'Intifada' chants by some protesters are 'horribly upsetting'\n\nDozens of protesters gathered Wednesday in and around Fordham University’s Leon Lowenstein Center in Manhattan and established an encampment. The group is demanding the university divest from all companies “complicit in the Israeli occupation and ongoing siege,” according to a statement from the Fordham for Palestine Coalition.\n\nAs the demonstration grew throughout the afternoon, it also attracted a handful of onlookers and opponents who occasionally shouted pro-Israel remarks as they passed. Asa Kittay and Carly Connors said they were in class down the street when they heard demonstrators chanting “Intifada,” an Arabic word for uprising or rebellion. Kittay, who held up a tablet with an image of the Israeli flag, said it was “horribly upsetting.”“I believe that these two states can co-exist peacefully,” Connors said. “I do not believe in an intifada. That is not very anti-genocide.” John Lefkowitz, who attended the protest with friends who go to Fordham, said he believes the demonstrations are sometimes incorrectly characterized as antisemitic by people who are uninformed about the position of anti-Zionism.“It’s often told that Jews should feel unsafe in pro-Palestine circles. As a Jew, I’ve never felt unsafe in a pro-Palestinian circle,” he said. “These people are great, they’re not anti-semites.”\n\nBack to the future: Columbia a focal point again in protest history\n\nThe descent of police on Hamilton Hall at Columbia University outfitted in full riot gear and enforcing mass arrests Tuesday night fell on the same date and place police cracked down on antiwar protesters in 1968. Some fear the clash heralds a similar outcome at the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where political leaders are emboldened to sic the cops on demonstrators ever more intent on showing up.“I don’t think it’ll keep anyone from Chicago, it might even inspire more people to come,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC and the national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network.Democrats already feared a repeat of the chaos from 56 years ago where police and demonstrators clashed, drawing all eyes away from the convention.At the crackdown at Columbia April 30, 1968, police arrested over 700 people and over 100 injuries were reported, according to a Columbia University Libraries publication. Police arrested almost 300 people Tuesday between Columbia and City College, according to the city’s top cop.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nArraignments from first arrests at New York universities begin\n\nLate Wednesday night, the first arrests from the protests at Columbia University and the City College of New York began to be arraigned at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, the same building where former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is underway.\n\nOutside the court’s arraignment part, dozens of the protesters’ supporters gathered in the halls, many of them wearing keffiyehs. The mood was jubilant, and many were chatting or conferring with each other in small groups.\n\nWhen one protester exited the courtroom after his arraignment, he was quickly swarmed by friends and dropped to the floor in a brief moment of celebration.\n\nThat protester, who was at the City College demonstrations, had been charged with assaulting a police officer, a felony, and resisting arrest. However, the prosecutor handling his case recommended to the judge that he be released from jail, given that police “continue to investigate” the incident.\n\nArrests across U.S.:Campus protests across the US result in arrests by the hundreds. But will the charges stick?\n\n– Asher Stockler, The Journal News\n\nNYU encampment stays in place after others in city were torn down\n\nThe day after other city schools saw violent clashes with police, the encampment at NYU's lower Manhattan campus stood untouched. Punctuated by faded chalk reading \"End Jewish and Palestinian hate,\" the collection of tents and chairs took up about one city block near 181 Mercer Street, where the university's Paulson Center is located.\n\nFenced-off and guarded by a smattering of campus security, the encampment was bracing for hot weather with some protesters carrying umbrellas to block out the sun and one arriving with large bags of ice. Demonstrators needed to present a school ID to enter the encampment. The barricades held signs reading, \"Fund our education, not the occupation\" and listing the protesters' demands, which include divestment and closing NYU's Tel Aviv campus.\n\nThe shadow of Tuesday's mass arrests and the forced removal of encampments on the other end of the island at Columbia and City College of New York was evident. Just outside the barricades, a group of demonstrators huddled to practice safety tactics.\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nNew York students continue protests day after mass arrests\n\nHundreds of demonstrators at Columbia University and City College of New York gathered Wednesday evening a day after administrators from both universities called police in riot gear on the protesters.\n\n“Our encampment is what it could look like to be liberated,” Hadeeqa Arzoo, a City College student, said, as several cars honked in support while she led chants of “Free Palestine.” “So I will continue to cultivate these spaces of liberation within the belly of the beast. That is resistance.”\n\nEven if both schools no longer had encampments, demonstrators promised to continue their activism in support of Palestinians and in opposition to schools’ investments in Israel.\n\n“There is not a single student-led uprising in history met with severe state-sanctioned violence that did not end up being right,” Maryam Alwan, a Columbia student organizer, said. She likened their cause — and police's response — to the civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter protests, including allegations of outside agitators and property damage.\n\nAs the sun fell outside City College’s campus in West Harlem, several dozen police officers surrounded the protesters standing inside barricades. The rally, which included two Islamic prayers, would continue into the night before students returned to Columbia, some walking down the valley and back up the hill to the other campus.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nUT-Dallas confirms 17 arrests hours after encampment set up\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas confirmed law enforcement officers arrested over a dozen people hours after pro-Palestinian student demonstrators constructed an encampment Wednesday.\n\nUT-Dallas spokesperson Brittany Magelssen told USA TODAY that 17 people were arrested on criminal trespassing charges as of 5 p.m. local time Wednesday after university officials gave written notice to remove the tents. Magelssen said UT-Dallas requested outside law enforcement officers to assist.\n\n“Individuals may peacefully assemble in the common outdoor areas of campus to exercise their right to free speech, but they may not construct an encampment or block pathways. In the last six months, there have been several peaceful protests on the UT Dallas campus,” Magelssen said. \"The UT Dallas Police Department and area law enforcement partners are continuing to monitor the situation.\"\n\nThe UT-Dallas chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine said in a social media post students began setting up the \"Gaza Liberation Plaza\" encampment at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n“We reject our university’s complicity in profiting off the genocide. We will continue to escalate and put pressure on our university until UTD/UTIMCO divest from war profiteers and Palestine is free,” the student organization said early Wednesday.\n\nHigh school students joining the protest movement\n\nThe proliferation of antiwar protests in college campuses across the U.S. is filtering down to the younger academic levels, and some of the grown-ups are not happy about it.\n\nA sit-in planned for Wednesday at a Chicago prep school is the latest among high school demonstrations showing support for embattled Palestinians in Gaza. On Monday, about 100 high school students in Austin, Texas, walked out of their classes in protest. Last week, students in western Washington state similarly expressed their objection to the U.S. backing Israel's military efforts in Gaza.\n\n\"I'm protesting against a government that is actively hurting people just because of where they were born and what language they speak,\" Pia Ibsen, a senior at McCallum High School in Austin, told USA TODAY. Ibsen helped organize a walkout and left class for about an hour and a half.\n\nSome school and government officials have tried to stop the protests, arguing they create a hostile environment for Jewish students. That was the case last week when two county commissioners in New Jersey demanded a school district's superintendent cancel a pro-Palestinian walkout at East Regional High in Voorhees Township. The protest was replaced by a rally for human rights.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Kayla Jimenez\n\nUAW members hope presence at protest will 'move the needle'\n\nIn addition to the campus protests, hundreds of people bearing pro-Palestinian signs and t-shirts gathered at New York City’s Foley Square on Wednesday afternoon for a march and rally led by labor organizers on International Worker’s Day.\n\nParticipants included Brian Sullivan, 45, a member of the United Auto Workers whose local chapter represents social workers. Sullivan said seeing labor organizers come out in such large numbers could help “really move the needle.”\n\n“UAW endorsed Joe Biden and hopefully he feels some exposure here, that if he doesn’t do what’s right and what the UAW members are asking for, he risks that endorsement,” Sullivan said.\n\nJeremy Montano, another UAW member who works in the legal field, said the recent “explosion of interest” in the conflict in Gaza, particularly on college campuses, has also given him some hope. “Obviously it’s balanced out with a lot of despair about what’s actually happening in Gaza,” said Montano, 37. “But there’s been a little bit of a source of hope that maybe longer term things might change.”\n\nAlmost 300 protesters arrested in NYC; student group says some were injured\n\nNew York City police made 119 arrests at Columbia University and 173 at City College in Tuesday night's crackdowns on protesters, Commissioner Edward Caban said Wednesday. Charges range from trespassing to criminal mischief to burglary, and the breakdown of students to non-students facing charges was not yet available, he said.\n\nPolice said there were no injuries, although CUNY for Palestine issued a statement saying one student suffered a broken ankle, two had teeth broken and others received burns from pepper spray used by police during the clash.\n\nMayor Eric Adams said drones and encryption radios used at Columbia provided police with the element of surprise when they retook Hamilton Hall, adding that \"professionals at radicalizing\" had influenced the student protesters and co-opted the protest but without providing details.\n\nOfficers climbed into Hamilton Hall, which protesters had occupied earlier Tuesday, through a second-story window. Within three hours Tuesday night, they had retaken the building, NYPD said.\n\n\"It was about external actors hijacking a peaceful protest and influencing students to escalate,\" Adams said. \"We cannot allow what should be a lawful protest turn into a violent spectacle that serves no purpose.\"\n\nFordham, another NYC university, establishes encampment\n\nOutside Fordham University’s Leon Lowenstein Center building on Wednesday, another encampment sprung up. Students, faculty and community members surrounded by law enforcement officers and newly erected barricades chanted “Free, free Palestine” and “Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.” Inside, demonstrators including current and former students milled around their tents, played drums, banged on windows and held up signs reading “Free Palestine” and “Divest genocide funds” for passersby to see.\n\nJulie Norris, a 27-year-old Fordham alumni, said she arrived before 8 a.m. Wednesday to help establish the encampment. Norris, who spoke to USA TODAY on the phone from inside the Lowenstein Center, estimated about 30 people were inside with her and said they plan to stay until their demands are met.\n\n“The students can’t be stopped,” she said. “We saw intense repression against students on other campuses yesterday, and this morning students are ready to stand back up. There’s going to be no business as usual until Palestine is free.”\n\nNorthwestern, Brown reach deal:Make pact with student demonstrators to curb protests\n\nSome campus protesters cut deals, claim victory\n\nSome student activists who pitched tents and camped on university lawns to protest Israel's military attacks in Gaza have begun to declare victory after hammering out agreements with school administrators. Northwestern University just outside Chicago became the first U.S. school to publicly announce a deal on Monday. On Tuesday, Brown University protesters broke camp after President Christina Paxson said the Rhode Island school will bring divestment demands to a vote. Organizers hope the deals set a new precedent for protest encampments around the U.S. and show a way to find common ground without using force.\n\n“What these students have done is truly, truly historical,” Summer Pappachen, a graduate student and organizer of the Northwestern encampment, told USA TODAY on Tuesday amid cleanup of the lawn students held for days. “We have been able to achieve (our goals) while keeping students safe.”\n\n− Michael Loria\n\nColumbia building cleared:Police storm into building held by pro-Palestinian protesters\n\nWhat are college protests across the US about?\n\nThe student protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. In addition to divestment, protesters are calling for a cease-fire, and student governments at some colleges have also passed resolutions in recent weeks calling for an end to academic partnerships with Israel. The protesters also want the U.S. to stop supplying funding and weapons to the war effort.\n\nMore recently, amnesty for students and professors involved in the protests has become an issue. Protesters want protections amid threats of disciplinary action and termination for those participating in demonstrations that violate campus policy or local laws.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/13/berkeley-braces-visit-right-wing-speaker-ben-shapiro/664536001/", "title": "Berkeley braces for visit by right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro", "text": "JOCELYN GECKER and PAUL ELIAS\n\nAssociated Press\n\nBERKELEY, Calif. - The University of California at Berkeley will seal off large parts of its campus like a fortress with a closed perimeter and a “very large” visible police presence Thursday, when the birthplace of America’s free speech movement faces its next potential clashes.\n\nCity and campus authorities anticipate demonstrations at a speech by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor, and are preparing for possible violence with a variety of new strategies and tightened security.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, officers will be armed with pepper spray after the city council modified a 1997 ban at an emergency meeting this week.\n\nThe tactics to boost security are the latest indication of growing frustrations in Berkeley and other liberal cities that have become targets of violent political protests since the election of President Trump and battlegrounds for extremist groups that support and oppose him.\n\n“We have seen extremists on the left and right in our city,” said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, a Democrat who backed the police request to use pepper spray. “We need to make sure violence is not allowed.”\n\nShapiro’s event, organized by campus Republicans, is being watched as a warm-up act for later this month when provocative, right-wing speaker Milo Yiannopoulos says he plans to hold a “Free Speech Week” on Berkeley’s campus with a 20-person lineup that includes Ann Coulter and Stephen Bannon, Trump’s ex-chief strategist and head of Breitbart News. Campus officials say the event is not yet confirmed.\n\nIt will be Yiannopoulos’ second attempt to speak at Berkeley this year, after an event in February was abruptly canceled when masked, hooded left-wing anarchists dressed in black rioted outside the event — setting fires and smashing windows on campus and on nearby city streets.\n\nPolice and UC Berkeley officials were criticized at the time for giving demonstrators wide latitude and standing aside as the masked anarchists hurled Molotov cocktails at officers and caused $100,000 worth of damage.\n\nViolence escalated at subsequent off-campus protests and authorities say they have learned hard lessons as they struggle to balance free speech rights with preventing violence.\n\nUC Berkeley’s Provost Paul Alivisatos sent a recent campus-wide message detailing security plans, saying no one wearing masks or carrying weapons of any sort will be allowed on campus.\n\nPolice will block off the building where Shapiro is scheduled to speak and several other buildings hours before the event starts. Anyone entering the secure zone to pick up tickets must present a photo I.D. Nearby parking lots will be closed.\n\nBerkeley police chief Andrew Greenwood said police will make “very strong, rapid arrests” Thursday night if any protesters have weapons or wear masks.\n\nThe security measures include closing Sproul Plaza, the campus’ central hub that was the epicenter of the 1960s Free Speech Movement and site of its most historic protests, sit-ins and speeches.\n\n“Things have changed,” UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said. “We’re a quantum leap away from the sort of arrangements we needed to make in the past for events that have the potential to attract strong political support or opposition.”\n\nIn contrast, a similar event featuring Ben Shapiro on campus in 2016 before President Trump was elected and also hosted by Berkeley College Republicans had “ basic security.” It went off peacefully and made no major headlines.\n\nFor Thursday’s event, Mogulof said authorities are deploying “very, very large numbers of police officers” from campus, city and regional law enforcement agencies.\n\nBerkeley’s frustrations are shared by officials in other famously liberal cities such as Seattle and Portland, Ore., where Trump supporters and left-wing protesters have repeatedly taken to the streets in supposed free speech demonstrations that have resulted in violence.\n\nAt a protest last week in Portland, police said anti-fascist protesters threw smoke devices and other projectiles at officers trying to keep the peace between pro- and anti-Trump crowds. Seven people were arrested.\n\nBlack-clad protesters have been a menacing presence at protests in the Pacific Northwest since before Trump was elected, often clashing with police at May Day marches, and they continue to show up at the many demonstrations.\n\nPortland Police Sgt. Chris Burley said the frequent clashes take a toll on officers trying to protect free speech rights.\n\n“You’re out trying to ensure that everybody is able to speak their mind and observe an assault,” Burley said. “As officers try to step in to stop those assaults, the crowd turns on the officers.”\n\nGreenwood, the Berkeley city police chief, sought permission for police to use pepper spray because he said it is preferable to batons and tear gas for crowd control. Tear gas when fired disperses much more widely than pepper spray, raising the risk of hurting peaceful protesters who may be near violent demonstrators, Greenwood said.\n\n“It is a request made of urgency,” Greenwood told city councilors, calling protecting protesters and police amid continued violence in the city “a unique problem.”\n\nHe added: “The scope and scale of these demonstrations in our community is unprecedented.”\n\nGecker reported from San Francisco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/14/fact-check-national-guard-activated-16-times-us/5319853002/", "title": "Fact check: US activated National Guard 16 times", "text": "The claim: The National Guard is almost exclusively called against Black citizens\n\nThe claim began with this May 29 tweet by then-user @GarbageGangHQ, who now uses the name @amaiahorian: The National Guard are almost exclusively activated during civil unrest involving Black people.\n\n\"The National Guard has marched against US citizens a total of 12 times. (Eight) of them were in response to segregation protests, 2 were riots over police violence, and 1 to stop riots in the aftermath of MLK's assassination. They're almost exclusively called against Black citizens,\" read the tweet.\n\nThe user amaiahorian said the tweet was muted because of its popularity.\n\nUSA TODAY could not reach the poster for comment.\n\nInstagram user Mikah, who posts under the name theonepersonwhonoonegets also posted this claim, where it picked up attention. In the caption, Mikah questioned the effectiveness of peaceful protest.\n\n\"... what should the protesters do instead? Taking a knee in a silent protest didn’t work, going through the system didn’t work, just marching made the police decide to start shooting,\" Mikah wrote.\n\nMikah did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is the National Guard's purpose?\n\nFounded in 1636, the National Guard predates the Army as the oldest organized militia in North America, according to its website.\n\nThe Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 established a military reserve force — including the National Guard and Air National Guard, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard reserves — at the federal and state levels, according to The Library of Congress. The National Guard is part of a \"ready\" reserve category that can be activated by the president in a national emergency with or without the authority of state governors, as stated in H.R. 5426 (82nd).\n\nThe president also has the ability to dispatch the military or federalize the National Guard in states that either defy federal law or cannot control insurrections under the Insurrection Act of 1807, according to USA TODAY. Earlier this month, USA TODAY reported that President Donald Trump considered invoking the Insurrection Act during recent protests over the killing of George Floyd. Floyd was a Black man who suffocated after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground. The now-former officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe Insurrection Act was last used by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, when the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King sparked the Los Angeles riots.\n\nWhen and why has the Guard been activated on U.S. soil?\n\nThe National Guard has been activated at least 16 times at the federal level, according Dr. Richard Clark, historian for the National Guard Bureau.\n\nIncluded in Clark's timeline are:\n\nWhiskey Rebellion in 1792\n\nCivil War from 1861-65\n\nAgainst the Ku Klux Klan from 1866-1977\n\nGreat Railroad Strike in 1877\n\nDesegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas from 1957-58\n\nDesegregation of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi in 1962\n\nDesegregation of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1963\n\nIntegration of Alabama Public Schools in 1963\n\nMarch from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965\n\nDetroit Riots in 1967\n\n1968 King assassination riots in Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nNew York City Postal Strike in 1970\n\n1980 Cuban Refugee Crisis\n\nHurricane Hugo in 1989\n\n1992 LA Riots\n\nGeorge Floyd protests in multiple locations nationwide in 2020\n\nThe list was emailed to USA TODAY by Maj. Robert Perino of the National Guard Bureau of Public Affairs.\n\nAt least nine of the deployments pertain to riots, protests and enforced integration during tense periods for race relations. This is one more than on the social media list.\n\nThe 1967 riots in Detroit and the 1992 Los Angeles riots are the two riots \"over police violence\" when the Guard was called in.\n\n\"The writer of the statement assumes all segregation-related call-ups were 'against Black citizens.' In fact, most segregation-related call-ups in 1957, 1962, 1963, 1963, and 1965 were to protect African-Americans,\" Perino said of the claim.\n\nThere have also been innumerable state-level call-ups by governors for protests or unrest, according to a statement from the National Guard Bureau.\n\nWas the National Guard ever \"called against Black citizens\"?\n\nRobert J.S. Ross, research professor of sociology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, said the activation of the Guard to protect Black citizens began in 1957, with forced school integration in Little Rock, Arkansas, and ended with the 1965 Selma, Alabama, march.\n\nKnown as \"Bloody Sunday,\" peaceful protesters were tear-gassed and beaten while crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge during the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest voting discrimination, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHowever, deployments to \"'contain' Black 'rioters'\" started with the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles and continued in 1968 after MLK's assassination, Ross said.\n\nThe Watts riots began with the violent arrest of Marquette Frye, a 21-year-old Black man who was pulled over for drunken driving in the Los Angeles' Watts that neighborhood, according to The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.\n\n\"I was involved in two Chicago periods of protest when ... troops were in the city,\" Ross told USA TODAY in an email. Ross was witness to the city's reaction to the King assassination and the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"Federal and national guard troops were way more disciplined and less dangerous than Chicago police,” he said.\n\nEric Fleury, assistant professor of government and international relations at Connecticut College, also said the Guard's involvement in racial conflicts is complex.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, it’s relatively rare,\" Fleury said of federal National Guard deployments that centered on race. \"It peaks in the civil rights period. Afterwards, they were most often used to put down riots, such as during the Vietnam War.\"\n\nFleury noted the use of Guard troops in 1992's Rodney King riots.\n\n\"(National Guard troops were) supplemented with the use of regular armed forces. In that instance, you had Army corps and Marines patrolling the streets of L.A. They didn’t have the right to arrest, but they engaged in fire fights, resulting in fatalities on both sides.\"\n\n\"You really did have a combat situation on the streets of Los Angeles,\" Fleury said.\n\n\"The National Guard has played a dual role with respect to the civil rights of African Americans. Federal intervention famously helped to break resistance to integration in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. However, it has also been used to quell riots such as those following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King.\"\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE because it was not supported by our research. Most of the 16 incidents in which the National Guard was activated at the federal level happened during the Civil Rights Era in the '50s and '60s.

Christophe Ena/AP\n\nKennedy was at the match with his son and experienced the chaos first hand, telling CNN Sport’s Don Riddell he got caught in the crush at the ticket turnstiles.\n\n“I have to say, it was absolute chaos. And if it wasn’t for my son and if it wasn’t for the people helping me get over the fence – and it was a metal fence which was difficult to get over – if they weren’t there, then I would have been in serious trouble,” said Kennedy, who scored the winning goal in Paris against Real Madrid in the 1981 European Cup final.\n\n“The pressure was coming from all sides. It seemed to be that, you know, people were coming from the right. They were coming from the left. They were even coming from straight on,” he said. “Whichever way we turned … we were going the wrong way.\n\n“I remember being at a point where I just said to myself: this is so dangerous. There’s going to be a loss of life. I felt as though I was physically struggling against a lot of people.”\n\nEventually, two men on a metal fence got hold of him and were able to lift him to the other side, Kennedy said.\n\n“I was really, really afraid,” he said, adding that he was aware of “the tragedies that have been over the years. And I would never wish that on anybody because you don’t know which is the best way to turn. You didn’t know which was the best way to go.”\n\nOf those tragedies, the most well known in English football is the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster. During an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 97 fans were killed in a crush due to overcrowding in the stands and another 162 were hospitalized with injuries.\n\nReal Madrid fans experienced similar issues to those Kennedy describes around the stadium last weekend, with visitors speaking of poor instruction by UEFA and stadium officials, inadequate crowd control and violent incidents.\n\nPolice spray tear gas at Liverpool fans ahead of the Champions League final. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\n“As can clearly be seen in the revealing images which the press has published, many fans were assaulted, harassed, mugged and violently robbed. Events which also took place when people drove in their cars or buses worried for their physical well-being. Some of them also had to spend the night in the hospital for the injuries they received,” Real Madrid said in a statement issued Friday.\n\n“We want to know which were the reasons behind choosing the stadium as the host of the final and what were the criteria in consideration given what happened that day,” the club added.\n\n“In light of this, we ask for answers and explanations which determine who was responsible for leaving the fans unassisted and helpless,” the club said, adding that fans’ “general behavior was in every moment exemplary.”\n\nDetails are emerging about what fans endured.\n\n“All the other entrance[s] to the concourse around the Stadium that we could see from there were [unexpectedly] closed, and many locals were jumping the fences,” Real fan Amando Sánchez wrote on Twitter, noting that “officials were scared and not given the adequate tools to handle the situation [sic].”\n\n“No info was given [to] fans. UEFA should not be allowed to run an event like this any longer,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, witnesses told Spanish newspaper El Mundo that Real Madrid supporters were targeted by thieves and had their vehicles broken into at the match.\n\n“They came to take everything away from us, to rob us, but it was the Gendarmerie who launched pepper spray and rubber balls at us. We went down into the Metro and it had turned into a rat’s nest. If you tried to get out to look for a taxi, they asked you for 300 euros to take you out of there,” Enrique Cazorla, a Real Madrid socio (member) and attendee of five previous Champions League finals, told El Mundo.\n\n“We were lucky on exiting the stadium, but many other Madrid fans were robbed or attacked by gangs of what seemed to be locals, while exiting the stadium or on the subway, with a total absence of presence and action from French police,” Sánchez continued on Twitter.\n\nPolice officers guard the Stade de France ahead of the Champions League final. Christophe Ena/AP\n\nPressure mounts for investigation\n\nA blame game has been going on, with different accounts of last weekend’s mayhem coming from UK and French authorities.\n\nOn Monday, Darmanin said counterfeit tickets were to blame for the delay, claiming there was “a massive, industrial and organized fraud of fake tickets” and that “30,000 to 40,000 English fans … found themselves at the Stade de France either without a ticket or with falsified tickets.” UEFA, the governing body of European football, also said the buildup of fans at turnstiles was caused by fake tickets.\n\nThose figures have been disputed, while UK lawmaker Ian Byrne said attributing crowds and delays to fake tickets was “utter nonsense” and an attempt from French authorities and UEFA to cover their backs.\n\nCNN has reached out to UEFA for comment.\n\n“When you see the way the French police reacted, they were overwhelmed and the event wasn’t prepared,” French editorialist Alexis Poulin of Le Monde Moderne told CNN Sport.\n\nThe incident has brought the issue of heavy-handed policing back to the fore of the French conscience. Paris Police Commissioner Didier Lallement has been at the heart of several controversies, particularly during the Gilets Jaunes protests of 2018 and 2019, where 2,400 protesters and 1,800 policemen were reported injured and dozens of yellow vest protesters were reported to have lost an eye in violent clashes with police.\n\nParis’ police have also been accused of alleged brutality in a series of deaths in police custody that mirrored the murder of George Floyd.\n\n“Mr. Lallement has been there since the yellow vest movement. And it was very violent. And since then, he has been [taking a] tough line, using a lot of violence,” said Poulin.\n\n“He sort of rewrote the book of how to maintain order during the manifeste, during the protests.\n\nFor the Champions League final, Poulin said the police were “clearly unprepared.”\n\n“Mr. Lallement said that he was missing some men, there were not enough policemen to police the event,” he said, adding that there are reports that the stadium also hired employees who weren’t trained to staff the doors correctly.\n\n“So it’s a succession of mistakes.”\n\nHigh profile politicians, including French President Emmanuel Macron, are declining to comment in detail on the issue, he added, while government spokesperson Olivia Grégoire at a press conference Wednesday attempted to downplay the chaos.\n\n“First of all, very simply, could we have done things better or could it have been handled better? Yes,” Grégoire said.\n\n“First and foremost, the president of the republic and the entire government was sad and sorry for those people who had come and were simply deprived of the match,” he said.\n\nBut this has done little to reassure the public or the French media.\n\n“The French public was very disgusted by the way it went, especially because of the lies of the authorities, and the fact that they don’t want to assume the fact that they’ve been unprepared, and they are responsible, mainly, for the fiasco,” Poulin said.\n\n‘Inappropriate’ actions and shaken fans\n\nLiverpool Football Club has requested that authorities conduct a formal investigation into the ugly scenes that marred a final which was meant to mark a year of club success.\n\nLate on Friday, UEFA apologized “to all spectators who had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events” in the build up to the match. Additionally, the governing body has set up an independent review to “identify shortcomings and responsibilities of all entities involved in the organisation of the final” with a final report set to appear on UEFA’s website.\n\nPolice patrol the gates at Paris' Stade de France. THOMAS COEX/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Darmanin said “there were inappropriate and disproportionate actions by police officers and the riot police that have been documented.”\n\n“I want to say that there are two investigation requests,” he added, speaking during a hearing before the French Senate.\n\n“I personally saw two incidents where clearly maintaining public order and the use of tear gas was contrary to the rules of use and I asked for sanctions from the police chief for these two officers.\n\n“It is obvious that things could have been better organized,” admitted Darmanin, adding that “the negative image of this match is a wound for our national pride.”\n\nOn the issue of ticket fraud reported by Darmanin on Monday, the minister said that between 57% to 70% of tickets presented by Liverpool fans were fake.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra also addressed the Senate and announced that they have requested compensation from UEFA for ticket holders who were not able to attend the game.\n\n“We said to ourselves that the first thing we had to do was to ask for compensation for the 2,700 Liverpool fans who were unable to attend the match even though they had a valid ticket, and we asked UEFA to compensate them quickly and on an individual basis,” she said.\n\nPoulin said that last week’s match has brought up lots of failures, including failure by authorities to control the crowds.\n\n“But the main issue was the number of policemen and also the training of these people, because what the policeman said was that they were not trained to secure the stadium,” he said.\n\n“Will that be the case for future events?” he asked, noting that Paris is due to host the Summer Olympics in two years.\n\nSome fans have been left shaken by the experience.\n\n“I can’t remember much about the game. Now isn’t that strange? You know, we had a good view, but I can’t remember much about the game,” said Kennedy.\n\n“Because I think I’ve been traumatized by what had gone on earlier. You know, I must say that I was close to death.”", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt Dalal Mawad Camille Knight", "Amy Woodyatt", "Dalal Mawad", "Camille Knight"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/07/08/the-latest-mayor-police-safety-also-a-factor-at-protests/86847782/", "title": "Latest on Dallas shootings: Protests planned around world", "text": "Associated Press\n\nDALLAS — Five police officers were fatally shot and seven others wounded during a protest over fatal police shootings of black men in other states, authorities said. It was the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nHere is a running update of the latest news to come out of Dallas. All times listed are local to Dallas.\n\nProtests around the world\n\nCOLORADO — Black Lives Matter supporters said they plan to continue a sit-in in Denver in response to the police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana through Tuesday for a total of 135 hours. That's an hour for each of the black people they say have been killed by police across the country this year.\n\nThe gathering, across from the City and County Building, began Thursday afternoon, several hours before police officers were killed in Dallas.\n\nCALIFORNIA — Protests were planned in Oakland and San Francisco on Friday night. About 2,000 people blocked a highway in Oakland, smashed windows and scrawled \"murderers\" across a police building, leading to seven arrests on Thursday, authorities said.\n\nThe protest began with a mostly peaceful rally and march downtown. The crowd swelled, and about 1,000 demonstrators headed to Interstate 880, bringing traffic to a halt, police said. Vehicles were backed up for hours as demonstrators danced and played music.\n\nNo one was injured in the protest, but a small fire was set on the highway and two businesses had broken windows and graffiti scrawled on them, police said.\n\nIn Sacramento, guards were closing the Capitol early in expectation of a protest Friday evening. The demonstration was organized by affiliates of the Black Lives Matter movement after the Dallas shooting.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — A few dozen people rallied peacefully outside the U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, holding candles and quietly singing \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" amid a heavy local and federal police presence.\n\nHoward University student George Wyche, who's from Houston, said he was worn out emotionally from the racially tinged violence of this week. He said he believes there are no easy answers to the tensions plaguing the country.\n\n\"You have quotes about a race war from a former congressman. It does terrify you,\" Wyche said. \"But now is not a time for fear. It's a time for outreach. It's a time for belief in the greater good of humanity.\"\n\nUNITED KINGDOM — Hundreds of people took part in a Black Lives Matter protest in London on Friday. Large crowds of people marched through busy streets in the central part of the city as drivers honked their horns and passers-by pumped their fists.\n\nObama cuts short Europe trip\n\nObama had been scheduled to return to Washington on Monday. Instead, he will leave Spain on Sunday night after a meeting with that country's interim prime minister and a visit with U.S. military personnel.\n\nObama is currently in Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO summit.\n\nThe White House says Obama will focus next week on efforts to support police officers while addressing \"persistent racial disparities\" in the criminal justice system.\n\nKiller robot used by Dallas police appears to be a 1st\n\nWhen Dallas police used a bomb-carrying robot to kill a sniper, they also kicked off an ethical debate about technology's use as a crime-fighting weapon.\n\nIn what appears to be an unprecedented tactic, police rigged a bomb-disposal robot to kill an armed suspect in the fatal shootings of five officers in Dallas. While there doesn't appear to be any hard data on the subject, security experts and law enforcement officials said they couldn't recall another time when police have deployed a robot with lethal intent.\n\nThe strategy opens a new chapter in the escalating use of remote and semi-autonomous devices to fight crime and protect lives. It also raises new questions over when it's appropriate to dispatch a robot to kill dangerous suspects instead of continuing to negotiate their surrender.\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nDallas Mayor Mike Rawlings says the suspect in the sniper slayings of five officers used an AR-15 rifle.\n\nRawlings said that's the type of weapon 25-year-old Micah Johnson used in the attack Thursday night in downtown Dallas. A similar assault weapon was used in the attacks at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people.\n\nHe also says the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest. He does not know whether Johnson was wearing a helmet, \"but I was told he had some pretty good covering on.\"\n\nThe Dallas attack happened at a protest about the recent killings of black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota.\n\nJohnson was killed by a robot-delivered bomb after the shootings.\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nDallas Mayor Mike Rawlings says that when a gunman opened fire in the attack that killed five police officers, there were people in the crowd of protesters carrying rifles and wearing protective equipment who turned out not to be involved in the shooting.\n\nRawlings made his comments Friday in response to questions about initial police reports about possible other suspects.

Live TV video showed protesters marching along a street in downtown when the shots erupted and the crowd scattered, seeking cover.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/05/30/hundreds-march-through-oxnard-protest-george-floyd-death/5292622002/", "title": "Hundreds march through Oxnard to protest George Floyd death", "text": "More than 300 people joined a peaceful march through downtown Oxnard on Saturday afternoon, blocking downtown streets and the Third Street bridge as part of demonstrations held nationwide and throughout Ventura County to protest the death of a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\nDemonstrations also cropped up Saturday in Ventura, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, where authorities closed down a major intersection and freeway exits after some protesters spilled into the roadway and surrounded a deputy's vehicle.\n\nOn Sunday, plans for at least two local demonstrations were brewing in Thousand Oaks. Only a few people turned out for an 11 a.m. event, authorities said. A larger one was expected to start at 5 p.m. at the intersection of Lynn Road and Hillcrest Drive.\n\nIn Oxnard Saturday, marchers, many carrying signs that read \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Justice For George Floyd,\" gathered at Plaza Park. The group walked to the Oxnard Police Department station, across the Third Street bridge and back to Plaza Park, stopping traffic for several minutes. Organizers handed out face masks and hand sanitizers and protesters chanted, \"No justice, no peace. No racist police.\"\n\nThe march lasted about an hour without major police presence. There were reports of graffiti on the Third Street bridge, Carnegie Art Museum and nearby businesses but no other incidents.\n\nSome wore T-shirts that read \"I can't breathe.\" Parents brought young children along and passing cars honked in support.\n\nAt the police station, Stephanie Turner, of Oxnard, spoke through a megaphone recounting the times she and her two sons have been racially profiled. To a racially mixed crowd, Turner loudly spoke the names of George Floyd, Emmett Till and Eric Garner.\n\n\"We are the people tired of your foot on our necks,\" Turner said.\n\nThe protest was restrained compared to the fiery clashes with police in Minneapolis, Los Angeles and other cities protesting Floyd's death. Floyd died on Memorial Day after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since, spreading overseas to London on Sunday.\n\nGarner, the New York man who died after police put him in a choke hold in 2014, had also repeated the words \"I can't breathe\" before his death.\n\nAlthough the Oxnard march was peaceful, it was loud and filled with frustrations over local police actions. Many shouted the names of those who died under Oxnard police fire, including Meagan Hockaday in 2015 and Alfonso Limon Jr. in 2012.\n\nThere was no obvious police presence during the march.\n\n\"The most important thing is that nobody got hurt, and we are grateful for that,\" Oxnard Police Chief Scott Whitney said in a statement. \"We’re also glad that there were no police confrontations. Many protesters made it a point that Oxnard was going to do it the right way.\"\n\nWhitney and Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub both released personal statements in recent days condemning the actions of police officers involved with the fatal incident.\n\nThe Oxnard demonstration was spearheaded by a group of local community organizers from Oxnard and Ventura — Jessica Martinez, Denise Garcia and Debbie Pacheco. They used social media to spread the word and contacted Oxnard police to let them know their plans.\n\nOrganizers urged protesters to practice social distancing and wear face coverings.\n\n\"We want it to be safe but we also want to be heard,\" Martinez said.\n\nShe said she has friends and family members who have faced discrimination from law enforcement, and it's an issue that many people of color face. Martinez said it was important to offer an opportunity to voice these concerns in Oxnard.\n\n\"I am a huge advocate for voicing what's right,\" Martinez said. \"If you don’t have something in your backyard, you have to create it.\"\n\nMarvin McKenzie, a local pastor, said he came to the march because he needed to take action. He thought Oxnard really came together for the protest.\n\n\"This is a microcosm of Oxnard,\" McKenzie said about the crowd. \"We're all oppressed, we're all minorities, but when we come together we're the majority. That's what I see. I see the minorities becoming the majority.\"\n\nSaturday was the second day of protests in Oxnard over the death of George Floyd. On Friday afternoon, protesters marched from Wooley Road to the Oxnard police station. According to authorities, the march was peaceful and there were no issues.\n\nOther demonstrations\n\nIn Ventura, a smaller group of roughly 50 protesters lined sidewalks in front of City Hall on Saturday starting at 3 p.m.\n\nThe protest was organized the night before by Paige Kelly, 23, who recently graduated from nursing school in Milwaukee.\n\nKelly, who is from Ventura, said she learned about racial justice while at college. She figured she could pick a time and place for a peaceful demonstration and people would come out. She and her sister Maddie spread the word on social media.\n\nAt the event, demonstrators held up signs along both sides of Poli Street, cheering when passing cars gave supportive honks.\n\nDarean Martinez, who attended with daughters Nylah, 4, and Samara, 1, read about the Ventura gathering on a friend's Instagram post.\n\n\"You don't have to be a big city to have a peaceful protest,\" Martinez said.\n\nProtesters also gathered Saturday evening at the intersection of Thousand Oaks and Westlake boulevards in Thousand Oaks, a day after a group converged at the corner Friday evening.\n\nSaturday's protest, which drew an estimated 250 people, ultimately brought a law enforcement response that shut down a stretch of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and the Westlake Boulevard exit ramps on both sides of Highway 101 for a time.\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Cmdr. James Fryhoff, who serves as police chief in Thousand Oaks, said that late in the day a deputy’s vehicle was surrounded by protesters. In addition, some motorists reported people banging hands or signs on their vehicles, he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, because the road was being breached by the protesters, we decided to close the roadway down,\" said Fryhoff.\n\nAfter the road was shut down, a few people tried climbing the street lights, he said, but they weren't successful. About 30 to 40 deputies with shields and riot batons were quickly deployed and protesters left the area, another sheriff's official said.\n\nIn the end, no damage was reported and no arrests were made. Protesters largely stuck to sidewalks and crosswalks and there were young children, parents, teachers and coaches taking part, Fryhoff said. After roads were closed, some protesters walked to the overpass above Highway 101 and displayed signs to passing motorists below.\n\nFryhoff said Sunday his team would go out early to talk to organizers and let them know they welcome the protest but also advise participants to stick to sidewalks and crosswalks. If protesters take over a street, deputies will shut down roads, he said.\n\n\"We get it. We understand. What we saw was horrible, too,\" Fryhoff said of videos of Floyd's treatment at the hands of police. \"We just need to have it be peaceful.\"\n\nIn fact, the sheriff's commander said he welcomed a peaceful protest.\n\n\"I wish I could be out there with them. I really do,\" said Fryhoff, who broke is collarbone in a mountain bike accident Saturday. Police services in Thousand Oaks are provided by the sheriff's office through a contract.\n\nAlso Saturday, a small group assembled outside the Simi Valley Police Department. Another small group had gathered in Moorpark on Friday at Spring Road and Los Angeles Avenues, a sheriff's official said.\n\nAs of midday Sunday, no local law enforcement agencies had reported any notable problems stemming from the protests.\n\nLaw enforcement weighs in\n\nSome 40 Ventura County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Los Angeles Saturday evening to help law enforcement agencies there respond to rioting, officials said.\n\nSheriff Bill Ayub issued a personal statement along with the announcement.\n\n\"Earlier this week, I watched in disgust with the rest of the nation as a careless Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd and snuffed out his life while several other officers looked on,\" Ayub wrote, later adding that video footage showed that the officers \"clearly and unforgivably failed in their essential duty to care for George Floyd, and they have damaged the progress tens of thousands of noble peace officers in this country have worked hard and continue to work hard to achieve.\"\n\nWhitney, the Oxnard police chief, issued a similar personal statement on his Facebook page Friday.\n\n\"In my 31st year of policing and toward the end of my career, it breaks my heart to see these types of incidents still occurring,\" Whitney wrote in a public post. \"The disgusting actions by the officers who killed George Floyd cannot be explained, defended or tolerated.\"\n\nWhitney went on to note the original incident and subsequent protests didn't happen in a vacuum, but were \"partly the result of a 400-year legacy that our country hasn’t yet fully come to terms with. Many of us exit high school, and even college, with only a superficial understanding of our nation’s history, and with limited cultural competency.\"\n\nHe concluded by offering the police department's condolences to George Floyd's family.\n\nStaff writer Cheri Carlson contributed to this report.

The hearing before two Senate committees is the officials' first public testimony about the deadly riots.\n\nMeanwhile, senators are also holding confirmation hearings for several of President Joe Biden's nominees: attorney general nominee Merrick Garland, Interior secretary nominee Deb Haaland and Health and Human Services secretary nominee Xavier Becerra. The Senate is also slated to vote on the confirmation of Linda Thomas Greenfield for United Nations ambassador.\n\nPlease refresh for the latest updates on the Capitol riots hearings and the confirmation hearings.\n\nHearing concludes as Sen. Klobuchar calls intelligence failures 'very disturbing'\n\nThe grilling of current and former top law enforcement officials concluded after nearly four hours of proceedings Tuesday as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the Democratic chair of one of the panels probing the attack, said the intelligence failures were “very disturbing.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"They may have disagreed on some details,\" Klobuchar says of the witnesses and inconsistencies in their recounting of the request for the National Guard on Jan. 6, \"but OK.\"\n\nThough they could “point fingers” over the delays they learned of in the National Guard deployment, Klobuchar said they perhaps pointed to a system not equipped to rapidly handle a crisis.\n\nShe said they would continue to ask questions next week when they convened another hearing with leaders from the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense and the FBI.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, said “there’s no question in my mind there was a failure” to take the risk of the Jan. 6 riot “more seriously.”\n\nTop officials told lawmakers they did not receive intelligence before Jan. 6 suggesting it could turn into a violent riot.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nSund: Police acted in same ways for Jan. 6 attack, George Floyd protests\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said law enforcement did not treat those protesting the death of George Floyd over the summer differently than the pro-Trump demonstrations at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., asked Sund about the preparations and said it was not lost on him the \"difference in both police presence and response\" between the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and the summer protests. He noted more than 400 were arrested during the protests for Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground and kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Padilla added that on June 1, 2020, about 289 were arrested in one day during protests. To date, about 250 people have been arrested on charges relating to the riot at the Capitol, he said.\n\n\"We plan for every demonstration the exact same way, doesn't matter the message of the person, doesn't matter the demographics of the grievance involved in the demonstration, we do it the exact same way,\" Sund argued.\n\nHe noted that the agency had put into place plans that far exceeded any other event in all of 2020.\n\n\"Everything that we put into place for January 6 far exceeded any planning that we did for any events in 2020,\" Sund said, arguing the response \"far exceeded anything, any other event that I can recollect on the nation's Capitol.\"\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nSenator makes case for DC statehood in Capitol attack hearing\n\nSen. Mark Warner made the case for D.C. statehood during a hearing with law enforcement leaders who led the response to the U.S. Capitol attack, outlining how it could have helped quicken the deployment of the National Guard during the riot.\n\nWarner argued the delays in deploying the National Guard were partially due to the district's inability to deploy troops, something governors can do in states but in D.C. is a request to the Secretary of the Army and the Department of Defense.\n\nWarner, D-Va., said D.C. didn't have the ability to streamline the process because \"they're not a state and Mayor Bowser is not treated, I think, in a totally fair fashion\" and asked law enforcement leaders whether the mayor having this ability would help in the future.\n\nActing D.C. Metro Police Chief Robert Contee said he agreed that would help in the future. Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund argued there was an established process in place that was \"equally as effective.\"\n\nWarner highlighted the need for Congress to take up legislation making D.C. the 51st state, explaining this highlights the \"long-term discrimination against the district.\"\n\n\"As a supporter of D.C. statehood, I would like to see that move forward,\" he said. \"But even short of that, trying to ensure that the mayor has appropriate powers going forward.\"\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nEx-Capitol police chief: Pelosi's call for his resignation premature\n\nThe former chief of Capitol Police told a joint Senate panel investigating the Jan. 6 riots that he took issue with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s demand for his resignation, saying that directive was misguided.\n\nSteven Sund, who resigned his post shortly after the deadly assault, said Pelosi demanded his resignation “without a full understanding of what we prepared for.”\n\nEarlier in Tuesday’s hearing, Sund said he now regrets leaving the department, despite the admitted security breakdowns that resulted in the siege that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nThe former chief’s comments came as he acknowledged that an ominous Jan. 5 warning about the violent threat insurgents posed had not been shared and that officers lacked training for a breach of the Capitol building similar to the culmination of last month’s assault.\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nSund: 'I regret resigning' as Capitol Police chief\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said he regretted resigning his post after the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I certainly do regret resigning,\" Sund said when questioned by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. \"I love this agency. I love the women and men of this agency, and I regret the day I left.\"\n\nSund offered his resignation on Jan. 7, one day after the attack amid calls by congressional leaders that he resign due to the failed response to the riots. He officially left the agency on Jan. 16.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nSenator asks for phone records as officials offer conflicting accounts on National Guard request\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, asked that key law enforcement leaders testifying today provide phone records from Jan. 6 after two officials offered conflicting accounts of when the request was made for the National Guard to respond to the Capitol attack.\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund testified that he requested the National Guard help secure the U.S. Capitol at 1:09 p.m. the day of the Jan. 6 attack. He said he called former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving.\n\nThat request wasn't approved until 2:10 p.m. – one hour later, Sund said.\n\nIrving said he had \"no recollection of a conversation with Chief Sund at that time\" and said it was likely closer to 1:30 p.m. Irving said he huddled with Michael Stenger, the former Senate sergeant at arms, about the request before it was approved.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, who asked both officials about the different accounts, noted that this a moment where various times and the differences made a \"big difference.\"\n\nPortman followed up on Blunt's questioning on this discrepancy and asked that Sund and Irving \"provide us with those phone records,\" explaining, \"it seems to me that would clear up some of the confusion.\"\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nSenator chairing top funding panel presses officials on 'failure' to deploy resources correctly\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on a key Senate panel overseeing government funding, pressed top Capitol law enforcement officials on their “failure” to deploy resources Congress had authorized for them previously.\n\nLeahy, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, asked the former Capitol Police chief and the top law enforcement officials for the House and Senate if Congress had met their requests for funding each year. All three of the officials replied Congress had done so.\n\nThe Vermont Democrat said, “it’s not that we had inadequate resources but a failure to deploy the people in the way they were supposed to.”\n\n\"I really wonder why we didn't take it seriously enough to be prepared for them,\" he told the officials.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nCapitol police lacked training on building breach\n\nThe former chief of the Capitol police told a joint Senate committee investigating the Capitol insurrection that officers had not been trained for an actual breach of the building similar to the January siege that left five dead, including one officer.\n\nSteven Sund, who resigned shortly after the assault, also said that not all officers assigned to civil disturbance units had access to riot gear.\n\nThe stark admissions only added to lawmakers' concerns for the lack of preparations for the Jan. 6 demonstration that ultimately turned deadly.\n\n“I don't know why you would have a civil disturbance unit that didn't have riot gear,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio said. “They were not trained and they didn’t have the equipment. We owe it to the officers to provide the training and equipment they need.”\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nTop officials say they did not see FBI intelligence warning of calls for violence online\n\nTop Capitol law enforcement officials said they did not see intelligence from the FBI the night before the riot warning of calls for violence online and saying groups were “preparing for war.”\n\nUnder questioning from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the chair of one of the panels leading the hearing, former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said the report was received at Capitol Police headquarters the night before the riot, but leadership did not see it.\n\nMore:Investigators signal some Capitol riot suspects could be charged with conspiring to overthrow U.S. government\n\nThe officials previously faulted intelligence failures at the federal level for failing to forecast the escalation of violence at the riot. Former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, the House’s top law enforcement officer said the United States Capitol Police’s intelligence compiled from federal reports did not “forecast a coordinated assault” on the Capitol as had happened during the riot.\n\nBoth Irving and Michael Stenger, the Senate’s top law enforcement official, told Klobuchar they had not seen the FBI intelligence report.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the intelligence failure with the FBI report “raised some really big questions.”\n\nSund said the question “would be looked at.”\n\n“Lots of people post things on social media” that would need to be confirmed, he said.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nFormer Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund: 'These criminals came prepared for war'\n\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund defended the conduct of the USCP in his opening remarks during the Senate’s first hearing investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.\n\n“We properly planned for a mass protest and civil unrest,” Sund said during his testimony. “But what we got was a military-style assault on my officers and a violent takeover of the Capitol building.”\n\nThe former police chief resigned from his post in the aftermath of the deadly riots, which saw the U.S. Capitol ransacked and a police officer killed. Sund contended that Capitol Police had not been adequately warned or prepared for the gravity of the threat posed by rioters, and that calls for National Guard reinforcements had been delayed.\n\n\"Casting blame solely on the United States Capitol Police leadership is not only misplaced, but it also minimizes what truly occurred,\" Sund said in his opening remarks, repeatedly saying their best efforts weren't enough.\n\n“No entity, including the FBI, provided any new intelligence on Jan. 6,” Sund also argued, contradicting reports that federal agents had provided warnings about the severity of the threat from protesters ahead of the attack.\n\n“These criminals came prepared for war,” Sund emphasized. “They came with weapons, chemical munitions and explosives. They came with shields, ballistic protection and tactical gear. They came with their own radio system to coordinate the attack, as well as climbing gear and other equipment to defeat the Capitol’s security features,” he said.\n\nSund acknowledged that the images at the Capitol were “upsetting” to many in the country and that USCP was unprepared but pushed back on characterizations that the department was solely responsible for the Capitol’s ransacking.\n\n— Matthew Brown\n\n5 expert witnesses all support Garland for attorney general\n\nAll five witnesses at the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland to become attorney general supported his nomination, leaving any controversy to concerns about Justice Department policy.\n\nWade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said he would bring robust enforcement of civil rights laws.\n\nAndrea Tucker, a parent whose children Garland tutors at a D.C. elementary and middle school, said he brings character, commitment and dedication.\n\n“He is a man who actually does what he says he will,” Tucker said.\n\nDonna Bucella, former director of the executive officer for U.S. attorneys, worked with Garland as he led the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. She said they as they toured the carnage with 168 dead, they paused at the former day care center. “An empty silence overcame us,” she said.\n\nBucella said Garland made sure no corners were cut during the investigation and made sure all voices were heard.\n\n“He is a serious person and doesn’t shy away from making the hard decisions,” Bucella said.\n\nTwo experts invited by Republicans also supported Garland, but urged him to maintain policies from the Trump administration.\n\nJosh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, said Garland should continue a policy that avoided treating executive “guidance” statements as having the force of law. Former President Trump signed executive orders to prevent what Blackman called “government by blog post.” But President Joe Biden rescinded the executive orders on his first day in office.\n\nBlackman also said Garland should scrutinize consent decrees and avoid paying settlements in cases to third-party groups, a process he called “settlement slush funds.”\n\nKen Starr, a retired judge and former independent counsel, called the attorney general job difficult, but said Garland must make tough decisions.\n\n“It’s a hard job,” Starr said. “Controversy – at times quite bitter – goes with the territory.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nHHS nominee Xavier Becerra's confirmation hearing begins\n\nThe Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor & Pensions began its hearing for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, the Biden administration’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nAs HHS secretary, Becerra would play a crucial role in combating the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. surpassed 500,000 COVID-19 deaths on Monday.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are expected to press Becerra for his role in enforcing California's lockdown in response to COVID-19, as well as supporting some liberal policies, such as abortion. Several have expressed they believe Becerra is unqualified for the role.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the top Republican on the committee, said the “level of expertise that the American people deserve” may be more than Becerra’s experience, which also includes serving as a congressman representing California.\n\n“Members of Congress do not become subject matter experts just because they are members of Congress, just because they sit on a committee that has health responsibilities,” Burr said of Becerra’s previous assignment on the Subcommittee on Health.\n\nBecerra stated that HHS has a \"central role\" in meeting the ambitious goals President Joe Biden has set to battle COVID-19, including 100 million vaccinations in the Biden administration's first 100 days, \"safely and equitably.\" Becerra stressed he plans to achieve these goals in a bipartisan fashion.\n\nIf confirmed, Becerra would be the first Latino appointed to the role.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nCapitol Police official describes siege as 'worst of the worst'\n\nA senior Capitol Police official offered a moving recounting of the multiple, urgent calls for help to contain a riotous mob that had breached the Capitol last month.\n\nCapt. Carneysha Mendoza, appearing before a joint Senate panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, described a cloud of “military-grade gas” that hung in the hallways, saying that she still suffers from burns from the chemicals’ disbursement.\n\nDuring more than four hours of fighting, Mendoza said, she witnessed colleagues falling around her while others pleaded for help to keep the crowd at bay.\n\n“This was by far the worst of the worst,” Mendoza said of the siege, suggesting that no amount of additional personnel might have repelled the mob.\n\n“It was sad to see us attacked by our fellow citizens,” the Army veteran said.\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nSenate to hear from FBI, DHS and DOD on Capitol attack\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, said the Senate would hear from leaders at the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense on their role in the response to the attack at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nKlobuchar announced a hearing next week with officials from the agencies as she opened up Tuesday's hearing with law enforcement leaders on examining the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nNo date was announced, nor were the witnesses from these federal agencies.\n\nKlobuchar noted the heroism seen during the attack by police but said this oversight is needed to get to the bottom of how this riot happened.\n\n\"We want this to be as constructive as possible because in order to figure out the solutions, we must have the facts,\" she said. \"We are here today to better understand what was known in advance, what steps were taken to secure the Capitol, and what occurred that day because we want to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\"\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nTop Republican senator says he wants to hear about 'failure of imagination' and preparation\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said Tuesday he looked forward to hearing from Capitol law enforcement officials on any potential “failure of imagination,” preparation and intelligence gathering.\n\nHe also offered condolences for the officers who had died in the aftermath of the riot and noted the trauma “untold numbers of people experienced” after the riot.\n\n“The subsequent suicides of USCP Officer Howard Liebengood and MPD Officer Jeffrey Smith were just the first and most tragic results from the psychological trauma that untold numbers of people experienced,” Blunt said.\n\nOne officer, Brian Sicknick, died during the riot.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nChairman vows investigation into ‘colossal breakdown’\n\nThe chairman of Senate Homeland Security Committee Tuesday vowed a far-reaching inquiry into the “colossal breakdown” in security that preceded the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol assault.\n\n“The warning signs were there,” Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said, adding that the lack of coordination suggested a “systemic” security failure.\n\n“Our goal today is to begin to understand where those breakdowns occurred,” Peters said.\n\nThe chairman said the attack revealed an “urgent” domestic threat.\n\n“While today’s hearing is first it will not be our last,” Peters said. “The attack on Jan. 6 was extraordinary event that requires exhaustive consideration.”\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nTop House law enforcement official says intelligence did not 'forecast a coordinated assault'\n\nFormer House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, the House’s top law enforcement officer, detailed the intelligence available about the Jan. 6 riot, telling lawmakers in prepared remarks the United States Capitol Police’s intelligence compiled from federal reports did not “forecast a coordinated assault” on the Capitol as had happened during the riot.\n\nOn Jan. 6, he said their daily intelligence bulletin suggested the potential for civil disobedience or arrests was ““remote” to “improbable.”\n\nActing D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee is set to tell lawmakers the District’s intelligence did not suggest a “coordinated assault” either.\n\n“To be clear, available intelligence pointed to a large presence of some of the same groups that had contributed to violence in the city after demonstrations in November and December. The District did not have intelligence pointing to a coordinated assault on the Capitol,” he will say.\n\nThe Capitol Police Union has slammed their leadership for their lack of preparation despite intelligence suggesting potentially violent groups would attend the rally on Jan. 6.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nInterior nominee Debra Haaland begins confirmation hearing\n\nThe Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee has kicked off its confirmation hearing for Debra Haaland to be President Joe Biden’s Interior secretary, a controversial nominee who would be the first Native American Cabinet member.\n\nAn enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna Native American tribe, Haaland also serves as a congresswoman from New Mexico. She serves on the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\nBut her historic nomination is already under fire from senators representing oil, gas and coal states who are troubled not only by Biden’s executive order pausing drilling on public lands but also by her previous statements opposing fossil fuel extraction on the 480 million of federal acres she’ll be overseeing.\n\n“Rep. Haaland’s positions are squarely at odds with the mission of the Department of Interior,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the panel’s top Republican as the hearing opened. “That mission includes managing our nation's oil, gas, and coal resources in a responsible manner. Not eliminating access to them.”\n\nHaaland countered that the public lands could be used more for clean energy, such as wind and solar. And she promised to help fossil fuel workers find new opportunities in a future without carbon-emitting sources of energy.\n\n“The President’s agenda demonstrates that America’s public lands can and should be engines for clean energy production,” she told the committee.\n\nThe Interior Department has more than 70,000 employees and is responsible for managing nearly one fifth the land area of the United States as well as 2.5. billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf. The department’s portfolio includes more than 400 national parks, 100 national monuments and 500 national wildlife refuges.\n\nDespite the opposition from several Republicans, Haaland is expected to win confirmation.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nDC police chief says National Guard didn't like 'optics' of sending troops\n\nD.C. Metropolitan Police Department Acting Chief Robert Contee plans to testify that the National Guard did not want to send troops to the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 because they \"did not like the optics of boots on the ground at the Capitol,\" according to his prepared remarks.\n\nContee said at 2:22 p.m., after rioters had already started storming the building and two pipe bombs were found, he had a call with leadership of the Capitol Police, the D.C.

Irving disputed Sund’s account, saying in his prepared remarks Sund’s allegation was “categorically false” and that safety was his chief concern.\n\nSund also plans to say in his opening remarks that as the riot escalated and grew violent on Jan. 6, he asked for the sergeants at arms to declare a state of emergency and call in the National Guard, but was advised by Irving that the request needed to be relayed up the chain of command. Irving counters that he has “no memory” of a call from Sund at that time, nor did he receive any text messages.\n\nThe timing of the National Guard deployment to the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot and the communications failures among top Capitol law enforcement officials is likely to be a focus of today’s hearing. Officials have disagreed on this previously but the hearing is the first time the officials will be questioned in public.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\n5 experts to testify at Garland confirmation hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from a panel of five experts as the confirmation hearing continued Tuesday for Merrick Garland’s nomination to become attorney general.\n\nGarland, a longtime federal judge and former federal prosecutor, testified Monday that his top priorities are investigating domestic terrorism such as the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol and combatting foreign terrorism in the 20th anniversary year of the attacks Sept. 11, 2001. He discussed the need for racial equity in law enforcement. And he expects a moratorium would be declared on the federal executions.\n\nMore:Merrick Garland says he has 'great' concern about federal use of the death penalty, which surged under Trump\n\nDemocratic witnesses Tuesday are: Wade Henderson, interim CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Andrea Tucker, a parent of students at J.O. Wilson Elementary School; and Donna Bucella, former director of the executive officer for U.S. attorneys and a former U.S. attorney in Florida.\n\nHenderson submitted testimony calling for a change in course for the Justice Department, which he said was “deeply tarnished” during the Trump administration. Henderson criticized the department for supporting discriminatory voting laws and defending the spread of misinformation.\n\nHenderson called on Garland, who noted the department was created to fight the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War, to vigorously enforce civil rights laws. Henderson said Garland should enforce laws for voting access, deal with the COVID-19 crisis in prisons and suspend the use of the death penalty.\n\n“The need for robust federal civil rights enforcement has never been more important for the country,” Henderson said. “We need an attorney general who will reinstate DOJ’s historic commitment to integrity, independence and vigorous civil rights enforcement.”\n\nTucker will talk about how Garland has tutored students at a D.C. elementary school for decades.\n\nBucella worked with Garland after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, an investigation he headed.\n\nTwo Republican witnesses are: Josh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, and Ken Starr, a retired judge and former independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.\n\nBlackman has blogged about the lack of significant opinions among Garland’s decades on the bench.\n\nStarr was among prominent former Justice Department officials who signed letters encouraging the Senate to quickly confirm Garland.\n\nSeveral conservative Republicans on the panel supported his nomination Monday, so his confirmation is expected. The panel will vote March 1 and the full Senate is expected to vote next week, said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the panel’s chairman.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nAt Capitol riot hearing, ex-Senate security official calls for Intelligence review\n\nThe Senate’s former chief law enforcement officer Tuesday provided little insight into the initial preparations for the Jan. 6 Capitol demonstration, and instead called for a review of how intelligence is analyzed in advance of such events, according to his prepared opening statement.\n\n“We have to be careful of returning to a time when possibility rather than probability drives security planning,” said former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger in remarks prepared for delivery later Tuesday at a Senate hearing. “Though the events of January 6th certainly reveal that a review of intelligence-led policing should be done, returning to the concept of possibility driving security operations may result in the poor use of resources.”\n\nStenger resigned shortly after the riots that left five dead, including a U.S. Capitol police officer.\n\n“There is an opportunity to learn lessons from the events of January 6th,” he said. “Investigations should be considered as to funding and travel of what appears to be professional agitators.”\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nPolice officials to testify about Capitol riot at Senate hearing\n\nWASHINGTON – The current and former leaders of four law enforcement agencies tasked with protecting the U.S. Capitol face questioning from senators Tuesday in their first public testimony about the deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe hearing before two Senate committees comes as lawmakers investigate the buildup to the riots and the subsequent response by law enforcement.

The Capitol Police Union has faulted leadership for insufficient preparation and equipment for officers.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told reporters Monday he was hoping to learn more from the officials about intelligence leading up to the attack, why law enforcement was not prepared, and details on the National Guard deployment.\n\n\"Why were they not really fully prepared to deal with what was a very large violent attack on the Capitol?\" Peters said.\n\nSund, Stenger, and Irving all resigned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack.

The aircraft’s manifest stated it was loaded with cookies. Sudan rarely, if ever, exports cookies.\n\nA heated debate transpired between officials in a back office of Khartoum International Airport. They feared that inspecting the plane would vex the country’s increasingly pro-Russian military leadership. Multiple previous attempts to intercept suspicious Russian carriers had been stopped. Ultimately, however, the officials decided to board the plane.\n\nInside the hold, colorful boxes of cookies stretched out before them. Hidden just beneath were wooden crates of Sudan’s most precious resource. Gold. Roughly one ton of it.\n\nThis incident in February – recounted by multiple official Sudanese sources to CNN – is one of at least 16 known Russian gold smuggling flights out of Sudan, Africa’s third largest producer of the precious metal, over the last year and a half.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter confronts staff at alleged Russian operation in Sudan 08:55 - Source: CNN\n\nMultiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN paint a picture of an elaborate Russian scheme to plunder Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue.\n\nIn exchange, Russia has lent powerful political and military backing to Sudan’s increasingly unpopular military leadership as it violently quashes the country’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nFormer and current US officials told CNN that Russia actively supported Sudan’s 2021 military coup which overthrew a transitional civilian government, dealing a devastating blow to the Sudanese pro-democracy movement that had toppled President Omar al-Bashir two years earlier.\n\n“We’ve long known Russia is exploiting Sudan’s natural resources,” one former US official familiar with the matter told CNN. “In order to maintain access to those resources Russia encouraged the military coup.”\n\n“As the rest of the world closed in on [Russia], they have a lot to gain from this relationship with Sudan’s generals and from helping the generals remain in power,” the former official added. “That ‘help’ runs the gamut from training and intelligence support to jointly benefiting from Sudan’s stolen gold.”\n\nAt the heart of this quid pro quo between Moscow and Sudan’s military junta is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and key ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe heavily sanctioned 61-year-old controls a shadowy network of companies that includes Wagner, a paramilitary group linked to alleged torture, mass killings and looting in several war-torn countries including Syria and the Central African Republic (CAR). Prigozhin denies links to Wagner.\n\nIn Sudan, Prigozhin’s main vehicle is a US-sanctioned company called Meroe Gold – a subsidiary of Prigozhin owned M-invest – which extracts gold while providing weapons and training to the country’s army and paramilitaries, according to invoices seen by CNN.\n\n“Through Meroe Gold, or other companies associated with Prigozhin employees, he has developed a strategy to loot the economic resources of the African countries where he intervenes, as a counterpart to his support to the governments in place,” said Denis Korotkov, investigator at the London-based Dossier Center, which tracks the criminal activity of various people associated with the Kremlin. The center was started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, now living in exile in London.\n\nCNN, in collaboration with the Dossier Center, can also reveal that at least one high-level Wagner operative – Alexander Sergeyevich Kuznetsov – has overseen operations in Sudan’s key gold mining, processing and transit sites in recent years.\n\nKuznetsov – also known by his call signs “Ratibor” and “Radimir” – is a convicted kidnapper who fought in neighboring Libya and commanded Wagner’s first attack and reconnaissance company in 2014. He is a four-time recipient of Russia’s Order of Courage award and was pictured alongside Putin and Dmitri Utkin – Wagner’s founder – in 2017. The European Union sanctioned Kuznetsov in 2021.\n\nThe growing bond between Sudan’s military rulers and Moscow has spawned an intricate gold smuggling network. According to Sudanese official sources as well as flight data reviewed by CNN in collaboration with flight tracker Twitter account Gerjon, at least 16 of the flights intercepted by Sudanese officials last year were operated by military plane that came to and from the Syrian port city of Latakia where Russia has a major airbase.\n\nGold shipments also follow a land route to the CAR, where Wagner has propped up a repressive regime and is reported to have meted out some of its cruelest tactics on the country’s population, according to multiple Sudanese official sources and the Dossier Center.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian foreign ministry, the Russian defense ministry and the parent organization for the group of companies run by Prigozhin for comment. None has responded.\n\nResponding to the findings of CNN’s investigation, a US State Department spokesperson said: “We are monitoring this issue closely, including the reported activities of Meroe Gold, the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, and other sanctioned actors in Sudan, the region, and throughout the gold trade.\n\n“We support the Sudanese people in their pursuit of a democratic and prosperous Sudan that respects human rights,” the spokesperson added. “We will continue to make clear our concerns to Sudanese military officials about the malign impact of Wagner, Meroe Gold, and other actors.”\n\nReceding into the shadows\n\nRussia’s meddling in Sudan’s gold began in earnest in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea prompted a slew of Western sanctions. Gold shipments proved an effective way of accumulating and transferring wealth, bolstering Russia’s state coffers while sidestepping international financial monitoring systems.\n\n“The downside of gold is that it’s physical and a lot more cumbersome to use than international wire transfers but the flip side is that it’s much harder if not impossible to freeze or seize,” said Daniel McDowell, sanctions specialist and associate professor of Political Science at Syracuse University.\n\nThe hub of Russia’s gold extraction operation lies deep in the desert of northeast Sudan, a bleached landscape peppered with gaping chasms where miners toil in searing heat, with only tents fashioned from scraps of tarpaulin and sandbags providing any respite.\n\nAlex Platt, CNN\n\nMiners from those remote artisanal mines converge on al-Ibaidiya – known as ‘gold town’ – every morning, lugging sacks of gold in carts hauled by donkeys along the town’s unpaved roads. The highest bidders for their goods, many of them say, are almost invariably merchants dispatched from a nearby processing plant known by locals as ‘the Russian company.’\n\nIt’s a helter-skelter selling process that sources tell CNN is the nerve center of Russia’s gold siphoning. Some 85% of the gold in Sudan is sold this way, according to official statistics seen by CNN. The transactions are mostly off-the-books, and Russia dominates this market, according to multiple sources, including mining whistleblowers and security sources.\n\nFor at least a decade, Russia has hidden its Sudanese gold dealings from the official record. Sudan’s official Foreign Trade Statistics since 2011 consistently list Russia’s total gold exports from the country at zero, despite copious evidence of Moscow’s extensive dealings in this sector.\n\nBecause Russia has benefited from considerable government blind spots, it is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of gold it has removed from Sudan. But at least seven sources familiar with events accuse Russia of driving the lion’s share of Sudan’s gold smuggling operations – which is where most of Sudan’s gold has ended up in recent years, according to official statistics.\n\nMilling machines grind gold ore in the al-Ibaidiya milling plant.

Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya is known as 'gold town' and sources say it lies at the center of Russia's gold smuggling operation. Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya, Sudan Prev Next\n\nA whistleblower from inside the Sudanese Central Bank showed CNN a photo of a spreadsheet showing that 32.7 tons was unaccounted for in 2021. Using current prices, this amounts to $1.9 billion worth of missing gold, at $60 million a ton.\n\nBut multiple former and current officials say that the amount of missing gold is even larger, arguing that the Sudanese government vastly underestimates the gold produced at informal artisanal mines, distorting the real number.\n\nMost of CNN’s insider sources claim that around 90% of Sudan’s gold production is being smuggled out. If true, that would amount to roughly $13.4 billion worth of gold that has circumvented customs and regulations, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars lost in government revenue. CNN cannot independently verify those figures.\n\nAn anti-corruption Sudanese investigator who has tracked Russia’s gold dealings in Sudan for years provided CNN with the coordinates of a key Russian processing plant. When CNN arrived at the site, some five miles from al-Ibaidiya, a Soviet flag fluttered above the compound. A Russian fuel truck was parked outside.\n\nA casual encounter with the guard – who confirmed that the facility belonged to the so-called “Russian company” – quickly turned into a tense confrontation.\n\nThe guard spoke through a walkie talkie, conveying CNN’s request to speak to “the Russian manager.” A group of Sudanese men then rushed to the scene and ordered the CNN crew to leave, before the CNN car was tailed by the security detail.\n\n“You need to go,” another Sudanese employee at the plant told CNN. “This isn’t a Russian company. It is a Sudanese company called al-Solag.”\n\nA Soviet flag flies over the processing plant deep in the Sudanese desert, a facility known to locals as the \"Russian company.\" Alex Platt, CNN\n\nAl-Solag is a Sudanese front company for Meroe Gold, the US-sanctioned Russian mining business, according to five official Sudanese sources and company registration documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nAl-Solag’s formation over the last year has marked a key turning point for Russia’s presence in Sudan. Under the new model, Russia’s dealings have receded into the shadows, making the arrangements more reliant on Sudan’s military leadership and further enabling Russian actors to circumvent state institutions, including regulations pertaining to foreign companies, under the guise of a local business. CNN has reached out to Sudan’s military leadership for comment, and received no reply.\n\n‘Too much US scrutiny’\n\nIn 2021, Russia’s Sudan envoy, Vladimir Zheltov, called for an impromptu meeting with Sudanese mining officials.\n\nAppearing visibly nervous, Zheltov demanded that Meroe Gold be “obscured” after becoming subject to “too much US scrutiny,” according to a whistleblower from Sudan’s Ministry of Mining who had first-hand knowledge of the meeting.\n\nBy June of this year, Zheltov’s demands had materialized. The transfer of Meroe Gold’s assets to the Sudanese-owned al-Solag appeared to have been completed. An analysis of the registration documents of the two companies revealed striking similarities, including two identical lists of legal penalties.\n\nUnder Sudanese law, a company wishing to transfer their holdings must also transfer judgments against it. It is illegal to have an undeclared foreign partner.\n\nSudan’s anti-corruption committee, a watchdog set up to assist Sudan’s transition to democracy, then blocked the attempted subterfuge, according to a former civilian official with direct knowledge of the events. The anti-corruption committee sent a detailed report to the armed forces in September 2021 with evidence of the Meroe Gold transfer to al-Solag, urging them to stop what they dubbed a “crime against the state.”\n\nThe watchdog also accused the military of complicity in Russia’s dealings, drawing the ire of the military leadership who lambasted the committee for “harming the armed forces,” according to the former civilian official.\n\n“The Russians and Sudanese officers saw the civilians in the government as an obstacle to their plans,” the former official added.\n\nIn October 2021, a month after the anti-corruption committee stopped the transfer of holdings from Meroe Gold to al-Solag, Sudan’s military staged a coup – which US official and former official sources accuse Russia of backing – and the junta immediately dismantled the committee.\n\n“Russia is a parasite,” the former official told CNN. “It pillaged Sudan. And it has exacted a very large political penalty by terminating a democratic project that could have turned Sudan into a great nation.”\n\nGen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary unit, is a key beneficiary from Russian support, as the primary recipient of Moscow’s weapons and training. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – the country’s military ruler – is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to be backed by Russia.\n\nHuman rights groups have implicated both Burhan and Dagalo (known as Hemedti) in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during Sudan’s Darfur conflict that started in 2003.\n\nOn the same day that Russia launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hemedti was heading a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to “advance relations” between the two countries.\n\nWagner boots on the ground\n\nOn a dusty border-crossing between the CAR and Sudan in March 2019, a bespectacled 34-year-old Russian frantically sent his boss – Meroe Gold owner Mikhail Potepkin – a plea for help.\n\n“Radimir is pissed that no one was warned,” wrote Aleksei Pankov in a Telegram conversation which the Dossier Center shared with CNN. He was referring to Kuznetsov, the menacing high-level Wagner operative, depicted as manning the border alongside Sudanese intelligence operatives.\n\n“Tell Radimir that it was a ‘closed’ operation. That’s why we didn’t warn him about it,” came Potepkin’s reply.\n\n“F**k, Radimir is scary. I almost s**t my pants,” Pankov wrote back.\n\nThis exchange is part of a string of evidence collected by CNN that establishes Kuznetsov as a key Wagner enforcer across key locations in Sudan.\n\nCNN has also seen official Sudanese communiques referencing Kuznetsov as a “problematic” armed Russian who was overseeing security at the Russian gold processing plant near al-Ibaidiya. A source familiar with Meroe Gold’s activities in Sudan told CNN that Kuznetsov also frequented the company’s offices in Khartoum.\n\nWagner operatives deploy to Sudan on a rotational basis, the Dossier Center told CNN, and Kuznetsov may be one of several Wagner men in the country. These are strategically dispatched to protect Russia’s smuggling scheme that has grown in importance since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.\n\nThose Wagner operatives appear to be part of a growing climate of fear as Moscow tightens its grip on Sudan’s gold pipeline, sources say.\n\nSeveral local journalism networks whose work CNN has drawn on for this report – such as Mujo Press, al-Bahshoum and activist journalist Hisham Ali’s Facebook page – have been targeted in recent months, driven into exile under the threat of assassination. Ten protesters were gunned down in demonstrations in June alone, three of whom were prominent pro-democracy activists. CNN security sources believe they were deliberately targeted.\n\nHigh-level Sudanese officials repeatedly urged CNN’s Nima Elbagir to steer clear of protest sites. Since CNN began this investigation, Elbagir has been put on the military junta’s hit list, according to multiple Sudanese security sources.\n\nAs images of Russian tanks encircling Kyiv were flashing on TV screens at Khartoum International Airport, employees watched as the plane laden with cookies and gold took off last February. Senior army brass had intervened and a sense of foreboding set in.\n\nSome of the officials who uncovered the haul were reassigned, some to regional duty stations, and others were sent to army reserves, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\n“They paid for doing their jobs,” the source told CNN.", "authors": ["Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Tamara Qiblawi Gianluca Mezzofiore Mohammed Abo Al Gheit Marco Chacón Natalie Croker Henrik Pettersson", "Cnn Exclusive", "Nima Elbagir", "Barbara Arvanitidis", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Mohammed Abo Al Gheit", "Marco Chacón", "Natalie Croker", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2021/09/08/police-schools-black-and-disabled-children-face-harsher-discipline/5436023001/", "title": "Police in schools: Black and disabled children face harsher discipline", "text": "Corey Mitchell, Joe Yerardi and Susan Ferriss\n\nCenter for Public Integrity\n\nThis story was produced as part of a collaboration with the Center for Public Integrity and USA TODAY.\n\nA school safety officer removed a third grader from class, took him to a staff bathroom, closed the door and berated him, telling the frightened child to “stop crying like a little girl.”\n\nHis crime? Refusing to leave art class after an argument with another student at their northeast Philadelphia elementary school.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident in 2017, Philadelphia schools issued a statement acknowledging it was not handled correctly. But a charged encounter with an officer in school is far from rare. Nationally, students were referred to law enforcement nearly 230,000 times during the 2017-18 school year, exemplifying why demands to restrict policing at schools are growing.\n\n“You’ve got some police officers that just can’t help themselves,” said the child’s father, Isaac Gardner. “You’re taking a little elementary school child in the bathroom. You ain’t supposed to be doing that.”\n\nA Center for Public Integrity analysis of U.S. Department of Education data found that school policing disproportionately affects students with disabilities, Black children and, in some states, Native American and Latino children. Nationwide, Black students, such as Gardner’s son, and students with disabilities were referred to law enforcement at nearly twice their share of the overall student population.\n\nSchools in some states are far more likely than others to refer students to law enforcement, regardless of their race and disability status. New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin schools did so at rates at least twice the national average. The repercussions ripple through communities in urban, suburban and rural areas alike.\n\nLancaster County Public Schools, a three-school district in remote eastern Virginia, had a referral rate 17 times the national average. In Philadelphia, one of the nation’s 20 largest school districts, the referral rate for all students was seven times the national average.\n\nThirty-one states, as well as the District of Columbia, referred Black students to law enforcement at more than twice the rate of white students, the Public Integrity analysis found.\n\nThese sharp disparities come despite years of mounting pressure on schools to stop policing kids.\n\n“They’re criminalizing some ordinary behavior of students, and they’re certainly disproportionately referring students of color to the juvenile justice system rather than disciplining them at school,” said Maura McInerney, legal director at the Education Law Center, a Pennsylvania legal advocacy group.\n\nIn 2017, a national study at the University of California, Irvine, found that on-campus arrest rates for children younger than 15 increased in areas where the federal government made grant money available in 1999 for school resource officers – a response to the mass shooting at Columbine High School. The funding was available whether a district struggled with crime or not, which helped researchers tease out the impact.\n\nNationwide, roughly a quarter of law enforcement referrals lead to arrests, federal data shows. Students may be issued citations that require them to appear before judges or other juvenile court system officials. The federal data doesn’t specify what the referral was for, nor the result.\n\nIn 2019, a Vermont student with a disability that causes bone pain was forcefully subdued by a school resource officer after educators suspected, erroneously, that the 17-year-old had a vape.\n\nThe officer demanded to search his backpack. The boy objected, using foul language, and the officer told him that he was “acting retarded.” The officer pushed the student to the floor, arresting and handcuffing him and leaving him with bloody knuckles and bruised wrists.\n\nShould we defund school police? Teacher is torn about how to keep kids safe.\n\nIn Vermont, students with disabilities accounted for 48% of students referred to law enforcement in 2017-18. That’s the highest among all states and more than twice their share of the overall student population.\n\n\"These are kids that school districts have traditionally not done a good job of helping,\" said Diane Smith Howard, managing attorney for criminal and juvenile justice for the National Disability Rights Network. \"They don't do a good job, the kids act out, and then instead of fixing the problem, they call the police.\"\n\nAfter the incident in 2019, the boy missed classes during a months-long battle in juvenile court over charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest – charges that were dropped after police released cellphone and bodycam videos of the incident.\n\nThe teen earned his diploma from an adult school. A settlement last year with the city and his school district, Maple Run Unified, required a $30,000 payment to the teen and training for the officer. A nondisclosure agreement restricts public discussion about the case.\n\nThis spring, civil rights attorneys sent a letter of protest to Vermont education officials after discovering that two school districts – one of them Maple Run – used Medicaid funding intended for students with disabilities to instead hire school resource officers, or SROs.\n\nDecades of policing students\n\nThe roots of school policing reach back to 1948, when Los Angeles formed a security unit that grew into a full-fledged school-based law enforcement agency. In the 1950s, Flint, Michigan, posted officers borrowed from city ranks in schools to serve as “liaisons” in an anti-crime strategy. School shootings led to an expansion of this policing. “Zero tolerance” for weapons morphed into crackdowns on kids’ behavior.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2018, the share of schools reporting the presence of at least one security officer on site at least once a week grew from 42% to 61%. The higher the enrollment and proportion of children eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches, the more likely schools are to have security, according to a report in 2020 from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice.\n\nFederal funds remain available to schools that want to hire police. Because of the specter of school shootings, many parents, staff and children like to know an armed officer is on site. The University of California, Irvine, study found that principals in schools with more officers reported lower rates of criminal incidents. With that decline came an increased likelihood that children accused of disruptive behavior would come into contact with someone in the criminal justice system rather than a principal or dean of students.\n\nIncreasing outcry and concerns that children of color are targeted have prompted some districts to remove police from schools. The trend quickened after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nSome states, Virginia most notably, have taken steps to slash referrals of children to law enforcement for minor incidents.\n\nA Center for Public Integrity investigation in 2015 identified Virginia as the top state for referrals in the 2011-12 school year. The commonwealth’s rate of about 16 referrals per 1,000 students was nearly three times the national rate. The investigation revealed that Virginia middle school students, some with disabilities, were arrested and charged with crimes such as felony assault on police and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn 2020, after years of adopting and rejecting multiple changes, legislators approved a bill making Virginia the first state to prohibit police from charging students with disorderly conduct at school or school-sponsored events. Legislators removed language from the state code that educators said contributed to driving up referrals because it obliged them to report any potential crime, including a possible misdemeanor.\n\nThe changes went into effect in July 2020. The Virginia-based Legal Aid Justice Center pressed lawmakers for years to enact the changes, producing reports that highlighted widespread disparities in referral rates and cataloging stories of children charged with crimes for minor rule offenses.\n\n“It’s a great step,” said Rachael Deane, legal director of the Youth Justice Program at the Legal Aid Justice Center. “But I still think that pieces of the puzzle that aren’t in place yet [will mean continued] high numbers of referrals from schools to law enforcement.”\n\nPublic Integrity’s analysis of the most recent data available found that in 2017-18, before these changes were approved, Virginia’s schools collectively reported students to law enforcement at three times the national rate, topping all other states.\n\nThe Lancaster County schools, serving about 1,160 students that year, had a rate higher than any other traditional Virginia district, behind only small alternative schools. Tracking both state and national trends, Black students and students with disabilities in the district made up a disproportionate share of referrals.\n\nAlso striking is the focus on younger children. Educators referred students 65 times from Lancaster’s middle school of 396 students and 19 times from the similarly sized elementary school, compared with 14 at Lancaster High School.\n\nLancaster County Public Schools Superintendent Dan Russell said he expects those numbers to fall now that Virginia law no longer requires educators to notify police of an incident. The process, he said, often went no further than a “simple conversation” about “two kids horseplaying.” If officers isolate children to speak to them about an incident, Russell said, an administrator must be present.\n\nRussell said only seven incidents in the 2017-18 school year led to more serious police involvement, but school records didn’t indicate why.\n\nLancaster County Sheriff’s Capt. Martin Shirilla said that if educators notified authorities about an incident, a school resource officer would keep a record “for statistical purposes.”\n\nResearch shows that those early interactions can have lasting effects. In 2020, a Tulane University and University of Washington study tracking Seattle Public Schools students found lingering effects from middle school interactions with police.\n\n\"Black respondents who experience contact with the police by eighth grade have 11 times greater odds of being arrested when they are 20 years old than their white counterparts,\" researchers found.\n\n‘Cops are trained to be cops’\n\nAfter the advent of cellphone video, the public has seen evidence that some officers injured or threatened students, including some as young as 5 years old. The Advancement Project, a civil rights organization, documented at least 62 cases from 2010 to 2018 in which police officers were accused of assaulting students.\n\nA video that went viral this year shows two police officers in Montgomery County, Maryland, haranguing a sobbing kindergartner they’d subdued and handcuffed in 2020 after he walked out of school. Officers screamed at length at the child, one declaring, “This is why people need to beat their kids.”\n\nGrainy cellphone video taken in March 2018 at a high school in suburban Minneapolis showed the tense moments before a police officer deployed a stun gun to subdue a then-14-year-old high school student, leaving him hospitalized, after the school resource officer called for backup. Burnsville Police Department records indicate that seven officers “responded to an incident of disorderly conduct.”\n\nNot all incidents are captured on camera – or even in federal records.\n\nHigh school students speak out:Students say police don't belong in schools. Here's how they forced them out.\n\nAccording to the federal data, the Pittsburgh district made 191 referrals to law enforcement and had zero arrests during the 2017-18 school year. The district acknowledges that’s inaccurate because of a data entry error.\n\nSchools and districts enter their own figures into the federal database. Among tens of thousands of such entities, some errors are inevitable. Nevertheless, the data is the only detailed information on discipline that covers nearly all public schools, and experts in the field said the stark disparities it shows are real.\n\nFor years, civil and disability rights advocates have pressed school boards and state lawmakers to get police officers off campuses, arguing that they often posed risks to students they were hired to serve.\n\n“Cops are trained to be cops,” said Marilyn Mahusky, staff attorney for the Disability Law Project at Vermont Legal Aid. “Consistent with their training, they demand that the behavior stop, and if it doesn’t, you’re charged, you’re arrested.”\n\nIn January 2018, two weeks after scuffling with Fair Haven, Vermont, police in a bathroom stall at her high school, a student in distress found herself in trouble again. She returned to school, in violation of her at-home suspension, and refused to leave the principal’s office. This time, officers restrained and arrested the girl, who later faced charges of assault on law enforcement, disorderly conduct, trespassing and resisting arrest.\n\n“While on the way to the hospital, the defendant stated she wanted all of us to die, and that she wanted to die as well,” a police department sergeant wrote in an affidavit about the case.\n\nMahusky was among the advocates backing state legislation that would prohibit schools from hiring school resource officers, called SROs for short. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott argued that school districts, not state lawmakers, should make that decision.\n\nThough the legislative push in Vermont failed, dozens of school districts across the country canceled their contracts with police departments or cut their policing budgets, some after identifying disparities in referrals and arrests.\n\nSchool systems in Minneapolis; Oakland, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle ended their agreements with law enforcement agencies. Two of the nation’s largest districts, Chicago and Los Angeles, slashed their budgets, the former by half and the latter by almost a third.\n\nChange also came to Des Moines, Iowa, where the school board ended an agreement of at least two decades with the city police department last winter.\n\nDuring the 2017-18 school year, federal data shows Black students represented 42% of all law enforcement referrals in the district, more than twice their share of the student population.\n\nDeborah VanVelzen, an officer with the Des Moines Police Department, patrolled the halls at district schools for 15 years before taking on a new role in late 2019 as youth services coordinator for the police department, overseeing youth mentoring and diversion programs.\n\n“We don’t want to send kids to court. That’s not our goal,” VanVelzen said.\n\nIn her current role, she has noticed racial disparities in court referrals.\n\n“It’s there, you can see it compared to what our city’s demographics are,” VanVelzen said. “People have said in the past that it exists. Then you see the stats, and you’re like, ‘OK, it does.’”\n\nThe Des Moines district acknowledges that school officials help create and sustain the disparities. That means solving the problem, there and elsewhere, will take far more effort than just canceling a contract with police.\n\n“In the community, it came off as SROs are the problem. If it was that easy, we probably would have identified that a long time ago,” said Jake Troja, the district’s director of school climate transformation. “The issue is, systematically, the overuse of law enforcement and underpreparedness of our school system to respond to safety violations and violations of law in an equitable manner.”\n\nThe pattern repeats across Iowa, where Black students were referred to law enforcement at five times the rate of white students. Students with disabilities were referred at twice the rate of the overall student population.\n\nIn incidents involving students with disabilities, often little consideration is given to the student’s individualized education programs and the behavior intervention plans outlined in those documents, said Nathan Kirstein, children’s and investigation staff attorney with Disability Rights Iowa, a federally funded legal assistance and advocacy nonprofit group. Kirstein has represented several families of children younger than 10 who were restrained or detained by police officers after classroom outbursts.\n\n“Were they in places where they were struggling behaviorally? Yes,” Kirstein said. “Did police need to be involved? No. That’s a huge failure on multiple levels.”\n\nSetting boundaries\n\nIn 2014, during the Obama administration, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice issued joint guidance aimed at ensuring that Black and Latino students were not unfairly disciplined in school.\n\nThe Trump administration rescinded the guidance, arguing that it made schools reluctant to discipline students for unruly or violent behavior because they feared federal discrimination investigations.\n\nIn announcing the decision to roll it back in December 2018, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos cited concerns about “school environments where discipline decisions were based on a student’s race” and maintained that districts should make the final call on student discipline decisions.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, referral rates for students with disabilities and Black, Hispanic and white students all dropped, the Public Integrity analysis shows.\n\nIt’s too soon to know whether racial disparities in school discipline increased or decreased during the Trump administration because the 2017-18 data is the latest available.\n\nIn May, 23 state attorneys general wrote to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking them to reissue and strengthen the Obama-era guidance. Twelve Democratic U.S. senators signed a letter requesting similar action.\n\nCatherine Lhamon, who served as assistant secretary for civil rights during the Obama administration, is poised to return to the role. During her confirmation hearing in July, Lhamon said she would push to reinstate the discipline guidance.\n\nThe Department of Education would not make Suzanne Goldberg, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, available for an interview, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nIn June 2020, as other big-city districts cut back their commitment to school police, Philadelphia rebranded its police officers as safety officers and decided they would no longer patrol school hallways. The move was part of a years-long effort to transform the police force and improve interactions between officers and students.\n\nA diversion program launched six years ago has reduced the number of arrests in schools by 84%, according to the district. In 2014, the district directed school officers to stop responding to internal calls related to minor student offenses such as insubordination.\n\nThat should have prevented the incident at Solis-Cohen Elementary, when the officer removed the third grader from class in 2017. But it did not.\n\nAnd the changes in Philadelphia didn’t stop the racial disparities in law enforcement referrals, the 2017-18 data shows.\n\nAbout half of district students are Black. Yet Black students were nearly three-quarters of those referred to law enforcement in Philadelphia during that school year.\n\nThe Philadelphia school district declined to make an official available for an interview. Spokeswoman Monica Lewis sent a statement that said, “Our school safety officers work to provide a safe and secure learning environment for our students and staff.”\n\nIn 2017, as the Philadelphia schools sought to resolve the matter at Solis-Cohen, district leaders enlisted Isaac Gardner, the third grader’s father, to help with a review of school police officer practices. That invitation was the last Gardner heard of the effort.\n\n“They never had plans on doing anything like that,” Gardner said. “Because nothing ever happened.”\n\nCorey Mitchell, Joe Yerardi and Susan Ferriss are journalists at the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/rnc-live-mike-pence-speech-trump-during-convention/5636612002/", "title": "RNC hits 'law and order' theme hard amid Wisconsin protests", "text": "Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC.\n\nReviving a theme that was central to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, Republicans used the third night of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday to hammer away at an argument that Democrats are to blame for protests and violence taking place in American cities.\n\nBy extension, they asserted that Democrat Joe Biden isn’t equipped to address it.\n\nThe attacks represented a shift from the previous night, during which many speakers sought to frame Trump in a softer light, and they were designed to fit into a broader appeal to suburban women that was evident throughout the evening.\n\n“The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” said Vice President Mike Pence during live remarks from Baltimore’s Fort McHenry.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIt was an issue Republicans returned to again and again throughout the evening, frequently misstating the former vice president’s positions on policing.\n\n“In recent months we've seen weak spineless politicians, seek control of our great American cities to violent mobs defund the police is the rallying cry for the new radical Democratic Party,” said Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law. “Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order to keep our children safe in our neighborhoods.”\n\nCan the strategy work? Polls show growing support for the Black Lives Matter protests and concerns about police brutality, including in the suburbs.\n\nHowever, many GOP strategists have noted that violence and rioting could drive many voters in the opposite direction.\n\n\"Democrats have got to be concerned about what is going on in so many of our cities,” said Republican strategist Doug Heye. “This could be the issue that helps Trump with suburban voters who otherwise might turn away from him. And so it’s no surprise that we’ve heard so much about it tonight.”\n\nPutting aside that the violence is taking place now – during Trump’s presidency – Republicans offered little in the way of explanation about why they felt Biden was ill-prepared to address racial strife at the root of the protests, or what Trump would do about it in a second term.\n\nSome speakers such as Lara Trump attacked Biden as being weak on crime, while others have slammed him for the 1994 crime bill they said was too tough.\n\nRegardless, the argument closely echoed the president’s own in recent months following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. It has allowed Trump to dub himself as the “law and order” candidate, just as he did in 2016, but it has also let him conflate Black Lives Matters protests with rioting in some cities.\n\nThe message has come at a particularly tense time in the USA, amid protests in Wisconsin following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. That incident, which has replayed on cable news networks since all week, has barely come up at the Republican convention this week.\n\nAlso not mentioned on Wednesday: Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old, who was arrested after shooting protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with an AK-47.\n\n\"The Trump team is trying to reduce the gender gap. Specifically, they are trying to prevent losses among white working-class women,\" said Claremont-McKenna professor Jack Pitney. \"As for law and order, they are trying to revisit 1968 and 1988, when Republicans thought that crime was their winning issue.\"\n\n— John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nDonald Trump joins Mike Pence at Fort McHenry after veep speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump wasn't going to let Mike Pence have the stage all to himself.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump joined Pence at Fort McHenry in Baltimore following the vice president's re-nomination acceptance speech.\n\nAfter the crowd chanted \"four more years!\" the Trumps and Pence stood at attention as country singer Trace Adkins sung the national anthem (which was written at Fort McHenry after a battle in the War of 1812).\n\nTrump, who has made a \"surprise\" appearance at the convention every night this week, offered another surprise in Baltimore – he didn't speak to the crowd.\n\nInstead, he will give his acceptance speech Thursday from the White House.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nMike Pence talks about on-going protests during RNC speech\n\nVice President Mike Pence called for an end to rioting and looting in his Republican National Convention speech that continued a “law and order” theme set earlier in the night.\n\n“Let me be clear: the violence must stop – whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,” Pence said, addressing without talking about the cause of the recent turmoil in Wisconsin after the shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man shot multiple times in the back by a police officer.\n\n\"We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color,\" he said.\n\nPence accused Democratic nominee Joe Biden of not saying “one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country” when addressing the Democrat’s convention last week.\n\nHours before Pence spoke, Biden released a video addressing the shooting of J Blake in Wisconsin. Biden said protests over police brutality \"a right and absolutely necessary” but “burning down communities is not protest. It's needless violence.”\n\nGuests at Pence’s speech included the sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer of the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.\n\n“The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” Pence said. “Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we’re not going to defund the police – not now, not ever.”\n\nSpeaking at the historic fort that inspired the national anthem, Pence on Wednesday said the election will determine the very definition of the country.\n\n“It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat,” Pence said in his remarks at the Republican National Convention. “The choice in this election is whether America remains America.”\n\nPence made his convention appearance from Baltimore’s Fort McHenry, the site of an 1812 battle against the British that moved Francis Scott Key to write what became the national anthem.\n\nA replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe, “Star-Spangled Banner” that Key wrote about flew at the national monument as Pence spoke in front of an audience of mostly military families.\n\nThe vice president said voters will decide whether future generations will have a country “grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the inalienable right to life and liberty.”\n\n“Or,” he said, “whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that is fundamentally transformed into something else.”\n\nPence called Democratic nominee Joe Biden “nothing more than a trojan horse for a radical left.”\n\nAnd he said if voters want a president who “falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,” Pence said, then Trump is “not your man.”\n\n“President Donald Trump believes in America and the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams in freedom,” he said.\n\nTrump has taken a tough stance on the football players who have knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nEven after the National Football League said in June that such “peaceful protests” should be allowed, Trump has said he’d rather the NFL not play if players choose to kneel in protest.\n\nIn 2017, Pence walked out of an Indianapolis Colts game after some of the San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nRNC hits ‘law and order’ theme hard amid protests\n\nReviving a theme that was central to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, Republicans used the third night of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday to hammer away at an argument that Democrats are to blame for protests and violence in American cities.\n\nAnd, by extension, they argued that Democrat Joe Biden wouldn’t be able to address it.\n\n“In recent months we've seen weak spineless politicians, seek control of our great American cities to violent mobs defund the police is the rallying cry for the new radical Democratic Party,” the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said. “Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order to keep our children safe in our neighborhoods.”\n\nPutting aside that the violence is taking place now – during Trump’s presidency – Republicans offered few details to explain why they felt Biden would be unable to address those concerns.\n\nWhile speakers such as Lara Trump have attacked Biden as being weak on crime, others have slammed for the 1994 crime bill he helped shepherd through Congress as being too tough.\n\nThe line of messaging, which closely echoes the president’s own in recent months, is aimed at framing Trump as a “law and order” candidate.\n\nBut it has also allowed the president to conflate peaceful Black Lives Matters protests with rioting and looting taking place in some cities, largely minimizing the message of the former group.\n\nSam Vigil, whose wife was killed last year in her driveway, lamented that cities like his home of Albuquerque with violent crimes have low rates of solved homicides.\n\n“It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the U.S. for a better life than her native Colombia only to be gunned down in her own driveway,” Vigil said.\n\nThe line of attack is coming at a particularly tense time on the issue, during protests in Wisconsin following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThat incident has barely come up at the convention this week, and aides to Trump have said he is reviewing the case. Also not mentioned: Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old, who was arrested after shooting protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with an AK-47.\n\n— John Fritze and Jeanine Santucci\n\nDonald Trump joins Mike Pence at Fort McHenry for veep speech\n\nYou didn't think President Donald Trump was going to let Mike Pence have the stage to himself, did you?\n\nTrump made a last-minute trip to Fort McHenry in Baltimore to attend his vice president's re-nomination acceptance speech.\n\nPress pool in tow, Trump landed on the site shortly before 10 p.m.\n\nPence is scheduled to speak at around 10:30 p.m.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nLara Trump makes the case for female voters, touts Trump as \"law-and-order\" president\n\nThe president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, opened up about her roots in North Carolina as well as marrying into the Trump family, describing her in-laws as “warm and caring,” “hard-workers” who were “down to earth.”\n\nThe 37-year-old wife of the president’s son Eric is one of the campaign’s top officials and one of the president’s fiercest defenders. She has focused much of her time on trying to energize female voters who are a crucial voting bloc in Trump’s re-election bid.\n\nTrump reiterated that message Wednesday night by highlighting the number of women President Trump has promoted both in business and in government and touting that female unemployment hit a record low in 2019 and early 2020.\n\nTrump said she “saw, first-hand, the countless women executives who thrived” at the Trump Organization.\n\n“Gender didn’t matter, what mattered was someone’s ability to get the job done,” she said.\n\nTrump told NBC’s “Today” show that the GOP convention message would feature a “hopeful and inspirational and patriotic” message compared to that of the Democratic convention, but she laced into Joe Biden, who she insisted would not “do what it takes to maintain order, to keep our children safe in our neighborhoods and in their schools, (and) to restore our American way of life.”\n\n“This is not just a choice between Republican and Democrat or left and right — this is an election that will decide if we keep America America, or if we head down an uncharted, frightening path towards socialism,” she said.\n\nTrump also touched on one of the major themes of the Trump campaign, attacking Biden as beholden to the radical left while her father has proven to be the “law-and-order president – from our borders to our backyards.”\n\n“We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams – for ourselves and our children – while consumed by worry about the safety of our families,” she said. “President Trump will keep America safe.”\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nOperation Legend highlighted amid RNC’s ‘law and order’ message\n\nSam Vigil, whose wife was killed last year in her driveway, lamented that cities like his home of Albuquerque with violent crimes have low rates of solved homicides.\n\n“It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the U.S. for a better life than her native Colombia only to be gunned down in her own driveway,” Vigil said.\n\nVigil said that it took eight months for arrests to be made in the murder, and that “help arrived” from President Donald Trump’s Operation Legend, an administration effort to send federal authorities into cities, including Albuquerque, to crack down on violent crime, named after a slain 4-year-old boy.\n\n“The Albuquerque police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case,” Vigil said.\n\n“I am extremely grateful to President Trump and the FBI for their efforts to deliver justice for Jackie and all the other innocent victims of violent crime,” Vigil said. “I know he will never stop fighting for justice, for law and order, for peace and security in our communities.”\n\nAlbuquerque leaders were hesitant about the operation, fearing an outcome like Portland’s, where federal agents have clashed with anti-police brutality protesters.\n\nOther convention speakers like Rep. Jim Jordan, Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle have hammered Democrats in a push to promote the president’s “law and order” message.\n\nRepublicans accused Biden of wanting to defund the police, though the former vice president has come out against the push.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nCongressional candidate says Democrats have \"normalized demagoguery and a radicalized identity politics\"\n\nMadison Cawthorn, the young conservative who pulled off an upset in the race for Mark Meadows' North Carolina seat in June, said Democratic leaders have \"normalized demagoguery and a radicalized identity politics\" at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.\n\nCawthorn, who was in a car accident as a teenager that left him paralyzed from the waist down, said his injury inspired him to enter politics, ending his speech by standing up with the aid of two people onstage.\n\n\"Today, political forces want to usher in the digital dark ages,\" he said, claiming that \"national leaders on the left have normalized emotion-based voting, and a radicalized identity politics that reject (Martin Luther King, Jr's) dream.\"\n\n\"MLK’s dream is our dream,\" he said. \"For all Americans to be judged solely on their character. Millions of people risk their lives to come here because they believe in the dream of MLK and the American dream.\"\n\nCawthorn also emphasized his support of \"freedom of speech\" at the convention.\n\n\"To liberals, let’s have a conversation,\" he said, alluding to previous criticisms he has made on Twitter, insisting that \"the left\" stifles free speech and promotes \"cancel culture.\"\n\n\"We are committed to building a new town square,\" he said of the Republican party at the convention. \"In this new town square, you don’t have to apologize for your beliefs or cower to a mob. You can kneel before God but stand for our flag.\"\n\n— Jason Lalljee\n\nNun, coach question Biden’s Catholicism\n\nSister Dede Byrne, who served in the Army as a surgeon in Afghanistan and Egypt, said President Donald Trump is the biggest opponent of abortion in the country’s history. But she called the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the biggest supporter of abortion rights ever.\n\n“As a physician, I can say unequivocally life begins at conception,” said Byrne, who called the rosary her weapon. “While what I have to say may be difficult for some to hear, I am saying it because I’m not just pro-life, I’m pro-eternal life and I want us all to end up in heaven someday together.”\n\nOne in five voters in 2016 were Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center. More than half (52%) voted for President Donald Trump and 44% voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut in a June Pew Research Center survey, 52% of all Catholics supported Biden’s candidacy but Trump was still carrying white Catholics.\n\nIn October, a Catholic priest in South Carolina said he had denied Holy Communion to Biden because of the candidate’s views on abortion.\n\nBiden has dropped his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion in most cases.\n\nBiden has proclaimed his faith repeatedly and he regularly attends church.\n\n\"I grew up with Catholic Social Doctrine which taught me that faith without works is dead and you will know us by what we do,\" Biden said in a video for the funeral of George Floyd, the Black man whose death in police custody sparked nationwide protests.\n\nLou Holtz, a former college football coach at Notre Dame, also hit Biden on abortion and said he was among politicians who are “Catholic in name only.” Holtz said one of the key questions he considers in supporting a candidate is whether he deserves trust.\n\n“I trust President Trump,” Holtz said, because “nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump.”\n\nBut Holtz said he couldn’t say the same about Biden.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRNC claims Biden is ‘anti-law enforcement.’ He’s not.\n\nIt’s a claim that President Donald Trump and his allies have been increasingly pushing this campaign: Democrat Joe Biden, they assert, has embraced a “far-left” agenda on policing.\n\n“Joe Biden has turned his candidacy over to the far-left, anti-law enforcement,” said Michael McHale with the National Association of Police Organizations, which has supported Trump’s candidacy.\n\nBut the facts don’t match that claim.\n\nWhile it’s true that some on the left have called for defunding police departments, Biden has repeatedly distanced himself from that position.\n\n\"As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,\" campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told USA TODAY in June.\n\nPressed on the point in an interview with Fox News last month, Trump pointed to a “unity” platform released by Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. That platform calls for banning chokeholds and ending racial profiling, but does not recommend defunding police departments.\n\nBiden has also called for a $300 million increase in police funding to address concerns about racial profiling.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nStefanik: President Trump protects American dream\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik recited the heroic history of her congressional district in upstate New York, from the Battle of Saratoga that turned the tide in the Revolutionary War to the Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal against the Soviet Union in Lake Placid 40 years ago in the “miracle on ice.”\n\n“Since our nation's founding, generation after generation of everyday Americans served and sacrificed to preserve and strengthen the American Dream,” said Stefanik, who was the first member of her immediate family to graduate from college and the youngest Republican woman ever elected to Congress. “The vision of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness – and the idea that if you work hard and dream big, you can achieve anything you imagine.”\n\nStefanik, who gained the national spotlight as a vocal defender of President Donald Trump during the \"endless impeachment sham,\" praised him for working to reopen the Main Street economy from the coronavirus lockdown. She contrasted him with his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, who has proposed to raise taxes as part of his economic recovery plans.\n\n“I believe in the wisdom and spirit of the American people to elect the only candidate who is capable of protecting the American dream, President Donald J. Trump,” Stefanik said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nHead of national police organization slams big-city mayors for 'unabated' unrest\n\nThe head of an organization representing more than 240,000 police officers across the country took aim at the leaders of large city mayors, saying they had abandoned rank-and-file law officers in the wake of civil unrest and calls for racial justice.\n\n“Good officers need to know that their elected leaders and the department brass have their backs,” said Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations.\n\n“Unfortunately, chaos results when failed officials in cities like Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement,\" he said. \"Shootings, murders, looting and rioting occur unabated.”\n\nThe organization has endorsed Trump for re-election after having supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008 and 2012. McHale called Biden and Harris \"the most radical anti-police ticket in history.\" Trump and his surrogates have often accused Biden of supporting the “de-funding” of police agencies, a position the former vice president has repeatedly rejected.\n\nBut the mostly-peaceful protests and civil unrest triggered by the calls for racial justice in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 death and other victims of police brutality have seen public support for police plummet.\n\nMcHale, a former Sarasota, Florida, police officer, echoed Trump’s “law-and-order” rhetoric that Democratic-led cities have sat idly by while their downtowns burn.\n\nBut mayors have said the president has helped foment the civil unrest with his charged rhetoric and deployment of federal troops to cities like Portland that have heightened tensions.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nDoes Trump ‘stand’ with Americans on pre-existing conditions?\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a compelling and deeply personal story about her decision to undergo a preventative double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene that increased her risk for cancer.\n\nThe story was moving, and it portrayed Trump as a compassionate boss who checked in with McEnany at perhaps the most traumatic time in her life.\n\n“I was blown away,” McEnany said, recalling a phone call she received from the president. “Here was the leader of the free world, caring about my circumstance.”\n\nBut McEnany veered into a far more disputed territory when she claimed that the president’s actions indicated he “stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions.”\n\nTrump largely ran in 2016 on rolling back the 2016 health care law that ensured Americans with pre-existing conditions could purchase health coverage. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has declined to defend a lawsuit brought by Republican states that would unwind those protections.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he will unveil a new health care law to take care of people with pre-existing conditions, but so far has not done so.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFormer Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz blitzes Joe Biden on abortion rights\n\nThe Republican Party brought in a former football coach at a major Catholic school to attack Joe Biden over the abortion issue – and even his commitment to Catholicism.\n\n\"The Biden-(Kamala) Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history,\" ex-Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said, adding that Biden and similar politicians \"are 'Catholics in Name Only' and abandon innocent lives.\"\n\nThe Trump supporter also said that \"nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn\" than the president.\n\nBiden says he is a devout Catholic who has respectful disagreements with the church on issues like abortion.\n\nBest known for his work at Notre Dame – his 1988 team won a national championship – Holtz also coached at William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota, and South Carolina.\n\nHe has also been a noted television commentator – on football, not politics.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP makes a bid for female voters\n\nThe third night of the convention spotlighted a host of women who support or work for President Donald Trump to shore up his eroding support among female voters, a group political analysts say are key to the president’s re-election.\n\nWednesday’s program heavily relied on female voices as well as highlighted the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment through a slickly produced video and speeches from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Second Lady Karen Pence and White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nMcEnany took the stage to offer a softer side of Trump, whom she said called her after she underwent a preventative mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene mutation. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway talked about how Trump empowered her to lead his successful 2016 bid while promoting women to senior positions in business and government.\n\n“He confides in and consults us, respects our opinions, and insists that we are on equal footing with the men,” she said.\n\nWhite, suburban women – once-reliable Republican voters – overwhelmingly rejected the GOP and helped the Democrats retake the House of Representatives in 2018, raising alarm that a similar gender gap could play out in November.\n\nDisapproval of Trump’s handling of the pandemic among women has only underscored his growing deficit ahead of the election. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found Trump behind Biden by 16 points among registered female voters.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nConway praises Trump’s dedication to ‘everyday heroes’ ahead of White House departure\n\nIn what is likely to be her final public address in her current position, senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway praised the president because she said he has “elevated” women to leadership roles in his administration and is a “champion” for Americans who are “everyday heroes.”\n\nConway, who recently announced she will be leaving her job in the Trump administration at the end of this month, highlighted those she said are championed by the president, including teachers and health care workers who have worked through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“A woman in a leadership role still can seem novel,” Conway said. “Not so for President Trump.”\n\n“President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the world of politics by empowering me to manage his campaign to its successful conclusion,” she said.\n\nConway was the first woman to lead a presidential campaign to victory in 2016, when she was Trump’s campaign manager in the final few months of the race.\n\nConway and her husband, conservative lawyer and Trump critic George Conway, are both stepping back from their jobs to focus on their family, they said. Their home life has been the subject of attention because of George Conway’s attacks on his wife’s boss and the recent social media presence of their teenage daughter, who has described an increasingly turbulent situation at home.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nKayleigh McEnany: I want my daughter to grow up in Donald Trump's America\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany gave a more personal speech in her convention appearance Wednesday, praising President Donald Trump's support as she had a baby shortly after a mastectomy.\n\n\"I want my daughter to grow up in President Donald J. Trump’s America,\" McEnany said.\n\nA former campaign spokeswoman who became White House press secretary this year, McEnany has spoken openly about the genetic mutation that made her vulnerable to breast cancer. She opted to have a preventative mastectomy on May 1, 2018.\n\nMcEnany, who has spoken at political rallies and urged women to support Trump, now has a daughter who is nine years old.\n\nChoosing a preventative mastectomy was \"the hardest decision\" she has ever made, McEnany said, but supporting Trump \"was the easiest.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nMother promotes school choice\n\nTera Myers spoke about her son Samuel, who has Down syndrome and advocated for “education freedom,” or school choice, a popular issue with President Donald Trump’s supporters.\n\n“I would like to extend my thanks to President Trump and his administration for their work towards making every student’s dream of a meaningful education a reality,” Myers said. She also lauded Trump for his anti-abortion stance, saying she was advised to terminate her pregnancy due to her son's disability.\n\nTrump has made it a point to call for broader school choice, which includes nontraditional schools that get public money, such as charter schools and private or religious schools that may receive taxpayer money as an alternative to public schools attended based on location. School choice critics argue that it takes needed funding away from public schools.\n\nMyers said that “one size did not fit all” with education, and that she helped pass legislation in Ohio that provides a scholarship to students with disabilities to attend a chosen school system.\n\nMyers quoted her son: “School choice helped my dreams come true. My school taught me the way I learn best. I was able to fit in. I made many friends. I became a part of my community. My teachers helped me become the best I can be.”\n\nRebecca Cokley, director of the Center for American Progress' Disability Justice Initiative, said in a statement that school choice is a “fallacy” for students with disabilities because private schools that accept vouchers aren’t required to comply with certain federal laws designed to give equal access to education for disabled students. “It takes advantage of parents that want the best for their kids as all parents do, and sells away their civil rights instead,” she said.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nThat RNC speaker? Probably from a battleground\n\nVoters watching the RNC are being bombarded with multiple messages at the same time: Pitches for President Donald Trump, arguments against Democrat Joe Biden, a sense of building excitement and, more subtly, a sense of place.\n\nThose places tend to be battlegrounds.\n\nMany of the non-politician speakers during the RNC on Wednesday hail from competitive states. The lineup Wednesday night included: Clarence Henderson, a civil rights leader, from North Carolina; Tera Myers, a school choice advocate from Ohio; and Scott Dane, who represents a logging and trucking association in Minnesota.\n\n\"America needs us to keep building and we can’t wait to be part of it,\" Dane said. \"In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden hasn’t done anything for the timber industry.\"\n\nSometimes the speakers don’t mention their home states on stage, and they don’t have to: Voters find out through an inevitable barrage of media coverage about the hometown business person sharing the “virtual” stage with a president.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFormer SEAL veteran: ‘We are a country of heroes’\n\nTexas Rep. Dan Crenshaw earned two Bronze Stars and lost an eye fighting as a SEAL in Afghanistan. But he said America’s heroes aren’t just the ones on the battlefield.\n\n“It’s the nurse who volunteers for back to back shifts caring for COVID patients because she feels that’s her duty,” the freshman GOP congressman said during the third night of the Republican National Convention. \"It’s the parent who will re-learn algebra because there’s no way they’re letting their kid fall behind while schools are closed. And It’s the cop that gets spit on one day and will save a child’s life the next.”\n\nCrenshaw’s message was notably upbeat during a convention that has often portrayed Democrats as dangerous, immoral and promoters of chaos.\n\nIn fact, Crenshaw never mentioned the Democrats and only once mentioned the president though not by name. Instead, he focused on the everyday Americans who have tried to keep people healthy in a pandemic and safe during mostly peaceful protests that have at times ben wracked by looting and riots.\n\n“Here’s the truth about America: we are a country of heroes. I believe that, so should you,” Crenshaw said. “We are a people with a common set of ideals conceived in liberty.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBlackburn: Leftists turn heroes into ‘villains’\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn lauded the country’s heroes among first responders and in the military, but she blasted Democrats for supporting nationwide protests against police.\n\n“Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their radical allies try to destroy these heroes, because if there are no heroes to inspire us—government can control us,” Blackburn, R-Tenn., said from the Mellon Auditorium in Washington. “Leftists try to turn them into villains. They try to ‘cancel’ them. But I’m here to tell you that these heroes can’t be cancelled.”\n\nBlackburn, who represents the “volunteer state,” also criticized social distancing restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 that have closed stores and prevented churches from meeting in person.\n\n“They say we can’t gather in groups at church, but encourage protests, riots, and looting in the streets,” Blackburn said. “If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRNC kicks off with mention of ‘violence’ in cities\n\nThe Republican convention kicked off its third night with an attack on violence in “Democrat-run cities” as the nation is wrestling with a deadly shooting in Wisconsin.\n\n“From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant,” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said in the first major remarks of the evening. “There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can’t - good, hard-working Americans - are left to fend for themselves.”\n\nFor three nights, violent protests have torn through Kenosha after a police officer shot Jacob Blake from behind at close range while he was getting in a vehicle. Buildings have been burned, windows smashed out and stores looted.\n\nA 17-year-old suspected of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was arrested as protests over police brutality and the shooting of Blake continue to rock the city and the country.\n\nCourt records show Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, faces a first-degree intentional homicide charge in Kenosha County.\n\n— John Fritze and N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nGoya CEO removed as GOP convention speaker\n\nA speaker who had been expected to deliver remarks on the third night of the Republican National Convention has been unexpectedly removed from the program hours before airtime. Another speaker's appearance is up in the air.\n\nThe campaign confirmed that Robert Unanue, the president and CEO of Goya Foods, will not be speaking Wednesday night, citing a “logistical problem.”\n\nUnanue’s praise of President Donald Trump at the White House last month sparked a boycott of his company’s products.\n\nAlso unclear is the status of a speech by former professional football player Jack Brewer.\n\nBrewer was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month. The campaign would not say definitively whether he will speak.\n\nOrganizers on Tuesday pulled another featured speaker, “Angel Mom” Mary Ann Mendoza, after she directed her Twitter followers to a series of anti-Semitic, conspiratorial messages hours before her prerecorded segment was set to air.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nHarris vows support for Israel, protection against Iran\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president, told a virtual fundraiser Wednesday that Joe Biden’s administration would offer unwavering support for Israel and would never let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\n“Joe has made it clear he will not tie security assistance to any political decisions that Israel makes and I couldn't agree more,” Harris said. \"I pledge to you the Biden-Harris administration will sustain our unbreakable commitment to Israel's security including the unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation pioneered during the Obama-Biden administration and the guarantee that Israel will always maintain its qualitative military edge.\"\n\nBiden as vice president was a key advocate for Israel’s security, with support for technologies such as Iron Dome and a memo for $38 billion over a decade in defense assistance signed in 2016, which Harris called “the largest military aid package in U.S. history.”\n\nHarris was also asked, in the aftermath of President Donald Trump withdrawing from a contentious nuclear agreement with Iran, how the Biden administration would protect Israel from Iran.\n\n\"Let me be clear, we will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Period,” Harris said. “We will continue to ensure that Israel has the unbreakable support of the United States.”\n\nThe Obama administration’s nuclear deal sought to hinder Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon. But the deal was heavily criticized, with skeptics saying it was unenforceable, and Trump withdrew from it. Harris said Iran “is revving up its nuclear activity and becoming more provocative.”\n\n\"I serve on the Intelligence committee and I believe that we are more isolated than ever from our allies and that we need help for us to meet this challenge,” Harris said. “The Trump administration took the issue of arms embargo against Iran to the security council recently and only one other country voted with us. I think it's fair to say this America First approach has been America alone which is not in our best interest or in the interest of our allies.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump reprises unfounded 'drug test' attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday floated the idea that he and Democrat Joe Biden should take a drug test before their first debate – reprising an unfounded line of attack he also used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\"We're going to call for a drug test, by the way, because his best performance was against Bernie,\" Trump told The Washington Examiner in an interview Wednesday.\n\nTrump offered zero evidence to support the theory that Biden used drugs to improve his debate performance. Trump used the same baseless attack against Clinton in 2016, telling a crowd then that, “I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate.”\n\nDemocrats dismissed the attack.\n\n\"Biden should agree to take a drug test if Trump will agree to be strapped to a lie detector,\" tweeted Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman in the Obama administration.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nDems rip Trump on WH backdrop\n\nDemocrats have been running a counter program throughout the Republican convention. They had plenty to complain about from the GOP's second night.\n\nAmong the issues: The president's decision to conduct a series of official acts in the White House and broadcast those events during a political convention. Also drawing fire: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech from Israel.\n\n\"These people are so unethical, whether it is legal, illegal. We think that it is illegal,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nMore:'The rules go out the window': Democrats deride RNC over Hatch Act\n\nIs it illegal? Trump has noted he is exempt from the Hatch Act, the law that prohibits the use of taxpayer resources for campaigning. It's another matter for aides, but White House officials have been dinged for violations before – with little to no consequence.\n\nEven Democrats seemed resigned to move on.\n\n\"The American people know these people are unethical and illegal and doing things outside the law,” Pelosi said. “What they want to know is what we’re going to be doing for them.\"\n\n– John Fritze and Bart Jansen\n\nDay 3: Prepare for the Pence show\n\nVice President Mike Pence will have the spotlight at the RNC, though he may spend much of his speech praising the real star of show: President Donald Trump.\n\nIf his past speeches on the campaign trail are any indication, Pence's remarks are likely to lavish praise for Trump while offering harsh denunciations of Democrat Joe Biden and what the Trump team has labeled \"socialist\" policies of Democrats.\n\nPence will go on the road for the speech, heading to Baltimore's Fort McHenry.\n\nOther big draws for the night: Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president who recently announced she's leaving the White House, and Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n– David Jackson and John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/26"}]}

Less than two weeks ago, President Joe Biden visited with UAW workers in Macomb County — in another event where the location was kept under wraps until it was held.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to have a get-out-the-vote rally on Saturday night at a charter aircraft facility in Oakland County. Trump is widely expected to win Michigan's Republican primary and be the GOP nominee to face Biden again in the fall.\n\nThe White House said Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, will talk about how Democrats in Michigan worked to protect abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

Even though a White House official said abortion rights are not a part of her official portfolio, the issue has given Harris some momentum after a first year in which the vice president found herself fighting off negative headlines, internal frustration and tough assignments that became political anchors.\n\nWith the midterm elections less than 100 days away, Indiana state Sen. Jean Breaux, a Democrat, told CNN Sunday she could see abortion rights as a chance for Harris to show off her leadership – both now and in the future.\n\n“I thought that there was something behind it for her, as well. That she was trying to position herself as a leader on this issue so that she could show America that she has the potential to lead and can articulate an issue that is resonating with voters all across the country,” she said after attending a roundtable event with the vice president last week.\n\nBreaux told CNN that still, she believed Harris is “sincerely concerned about abortion and the loss of abortion rights for women across this country” and White House officials and others downplay the idea Harris is making a political play by focusing on abortion. They argue she is only responding to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established abortion as a constitutional right.\n\n“This is not about the next election. This is about an assault on women’s reproductive rights. This is about an extreme Republican Party that is willing to dismantle freedoms and erode rights. I don’t think anybody’s thinking of it in a political sense,” said Cedric Richmond, who left his position at the White House to be a senior advisor for the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhile there is no action President Joe Biden can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, Democrats and advocates have been pressuring the White House to do more on abortion rights. The White House has dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access, including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in states where the procedure is banned.\n\nAbortion rights have long been a prominent issue for Harris in her campaigns. When she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, she vowed, if elected, to require states with a history of restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval before any new abortion law could take effect. “We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not understanding women have agency,” Harris said at the time.\n\nShe’s bringing that same intensity to her discussions with state lawmakers about how to respond to the Dobbs decision, in which the conservatives on the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Aides say the vice president plans to be more visible on any topic that is front and center for the Democratic Party as November grows near. In particular, Harris will continue to elevate abortion rights, ramping up her travel to speak to the “urgency of the moment,” three months ahead of the midterms, aides say.\n\n“As a former local official, the vice president is keenly aware of the critical role these leaders play, especially now when it comes to protecting access to reproductive care,” Kirsten Allen, Harris’ press secretary, told CNN. “The vice president will continue to travel the country and meet with leaders and people on the ground to highlight what’s at stake and build coalitions to protect a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from government interference.”\n\nHarris finds her voice on the road\n\nThe vice president has been traveling from state-to-state this summer, sometimes making several trips per week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade at the end of June. Harris has focused on deeply red and purple states like Florida, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania where state lawmakers have already put in place, or are discussing, newrestrictive measure to curtail or simply eliminate women’s access to an abortion.\n\nHarris will increase that already-ramped-up political travel over the next few months, with a significant number of trips focused on raising money for the DNC and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official.\n\n“She has been intentional about going to places and calling out mainly Republican governors in a way that we really haven’t done up until now,” one aide said.\n\nHarris allies, who had previously criticized the administration’s use of the vice president, now herald President Joe Biden for positioning her in an effective way on an issue where she has “deep credibility.”\n\n“This is just an area where she has a more defined profile,” the White House official said, who noted her focused intensified after Harris gave a forceful pro-abortion speech at Emily’s List hours after the draft opinion leaked. “It was a confluence of events, ability and opportunity all in one.”\n\nThe official said Harris then tasked her office with providing her data about wider implications of the Supreme Court’s decision, such as the effects if could have in vitro fertilization (IVF), access to birth control and same-sex marriage.\n\nStill, these latest appearances are giving hope to supporters who may have questioned what happened to the fierce former prosecutor who made headlines grilling Republicans during high-profile Senate hearings.\n\n“If you think about her as a rising star in the party, that’s what people saw,” one person allied with Harris told CNN. “They’re like, ‘Yes, she’s a fighter for us.’ And so, her voice out there on this issue is helping both to literally fight the fight, but then also to mobilize voters and remind voters what she is uniquely adept at.”\n\nLess than 100 days\n\nThe roundtables with state legislators have been a winning model for the vice president, allies say, as it props up Harris’ ability to convene and organize, while also shining a light on restrictive policy proposals across the country.\n\nThey’ve also provided Harris with an avenue to show the skills honed over years as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, providing a more emphatic voice on abortion rights than the President, who has a complicated history on the issue.\n\n“I think on issues like this, it’s clear why they are a good pair,” one source close to Harris told CNN.\n\n“In this moment in crisis her unique history, credibility, and expertise is just invaluable both to the administration as well as the country,” said Karen Finney, vice chair of NARAL and Democratic strategist\n\nThe vice president has tasked staff, aides say, with putting more of a focus on engaging younger voters as November grow closer. And a source with a Democratic-aligned super PAC told CNN that their focus groups show that Harris is still a popular figure with Black voters, despite the general dip in approval rating for the President.\n\n“So that’s going to be an important angle down the road,” the source said, suggesting Harris be deployed to help Democrats in tight House races, such as Georgia’s Sanford Bishop or Ohio’s Amelia Sykes, who is vying for an open seat.\n\nThe vice president will start campaigning with a relatively new team around her, after a series of staffers departed her office. A source familiar with office relations says that quicker decision-making has streamlined coordination with the West Wing and the vice president’s office during the administration’s second year. One White House official credited Anita Dunn, who returned to the White House amid staffing changes in the West Wing, as responsible for some of the positive change.\n\nThat’s led to Harris becoming more of a public face than she was during her first year, doing more media interviews in 2022 than in 2021 and taken far more trips to tout the Biden agenda.\n\nAbortion roundtables\n\nHarris has held more than two dozen roundtables on abortion rights since a draft opinion previewing the overturning of Roe v. Wade was published in Politico in May.\n\nFlorida Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who has attended two roundtables with Harris in both Washington and Orlando and rode on Air Force 2, said, “I really have the genuine sense that she is wanting to hear what we are experiencing on the ground.”\n\nIn some ways, Harris has been trying to create a national message for Democrats – repeating at nearly every roundtable how “one does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision” for women.\n\nBut advocates say Harris could be doing more, as they pressure the White House to be more aggressive on abortion rights legislation and meet the moment.\n\n“I’m really glad that the vice president is doing these things,” Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, told CNN at in an interview. “But we were asking for very specific things, and we need to see those delivered.”\n\n“It would be amazing to see her have a more forceful voice, to be able to say the word abortion unapologetically,” Sherman said, “to have her remind everyone in this country that everyone loves someone who’s had an abortion, and also to see the actions from the White House that match her energy.”", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/03/15/kamala-harris-biden-campaign-abortion-election/72973926007/", "title": "Harris abortion clinic visit shows Biden campaign hears voters", "text": "So Vice President Kamala Harris stood in a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota and said – out loud, for all the world to hear – the words “uterus” and “abortion” and “contraceptive care.”\n\nAnd lo, the world did not end.\n\nAfter speaking passionately and honestly Thursday about the reproductive health care rights women have lost since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Harris said: “How dare these elected leaders believe they are in a better position to tell women what they need, to tell women what is in their best interest? We have to be a nation that trusts women.”\n\nShe’s right. It’s remarkable that it needs to be said, but clearly it does.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris vs. House Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nAt about the same time Harris was visiting the clinic in the Twin Cities, House Speaker Mike Johnson was at a Republican retreat saying he opposes any federal legislation to protect in vitro fertilization, which has come under attack recently following an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that said frozen embryos are children.\n\n“It’s not my belief that Congress needs to play a role here,” he said from West Virginia. “I think this is being handled by the states.”\n\nIs reproductive health up to the states?Election minefield for Republicans got worse with IVF ruling.\n\nThat’s an interesting comment coming from a guy who is one of more than 100 U.S. House Republican co-sponsors of the Life at Conception Act, which contains no IVF exceptions. The same guy who has voted in the past for a national abortion ban.\n\nBasically, it’s up to the states when it fits Johnson’s ideology and up to the federal government when it doesn’t.\n\nHarris' Planned Parenthood visit shows who's on the side of women\n\nThe juxtaposition of Johnson’s man-confident hypocrisy and the first female vice president directly advocating for reproductive health care rights was striking. And it presents voters who care about reproductive rights – be it IVF or abortion or contraception – with a simple question: Who are you going to trust?\n\nThe first-ever vice president to visit an abortion clinic and speak in support of the rights lost to a conservative U.S. Supreme Court ruling, or the very conservatives who applauded the loss of those rights and appear eager to keep going?\n\nIVF access is reproductive justice:Alabama IVF ruling was protested by both sides. There's common ground for reproductive health.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has boasted about appointing the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, and he has recently expressed support for a 16-week national abortion ban.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in the wake of the Alabama IVF ruling, “ardent abortion opponents at the Heritage Foundation and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, among other groups, have sought to push lawmakers and state legislatures toward regulating IVF treatments in the United States.”\n\nIn 2022, 195 House Republicans voted against the Right to Contraception Act, which would’ve protected access to contraception from any government restriction.\n\nTrust women? That's not what GOP is doing ... at all\n\nNone of that demonstrates a willingness to, as Harris said, trust women. But it does paint a picture of an ongoing plan, often led by Republican men, to continue exerting control over women and the reproductive choices they can make.\n\nWith her unprecedented visit to that Planned Parenthood clinic, the vice president put down a marker, making it abundantly clear where the Biden administration stands.\n\n“The reason I’m here is because this is a health care crisis,” Harris said. “Part of this health care crisis is the clinics like this that have had to shut down and what that has meant to leave no options with any reasonable geographic area for so many women who need this essential care.”\n\nHarris made abortion-rights statement voters will remember\n\nAgain, she’s right. Women in states with draconian abortion laws have suffered, and continue to suffer. And voters care deeply about this, as Republicans have learned in recent elections.\n\nRepublicans like Speaker Johnson can wave off the issue of federal protection for IVF procedures all he wants. But that dismissive attitude, coupled with his own party’s culpability for the situations many women now find themselves in, will be remembered.\n\nAs will Harris’ willingness to stand in an abortion clinic and show voters whose side she’s on.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on X, formerly Twitter, @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/13/kamala-harris-to-visit-planned-parenthood-clinic-in-minnesota/72966176007/", "title": "Vice President Kamala Harris to make historic visit to abortion clinic ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris will visit a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota on Thursday as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to draw attention to the threat to abortion services and other reproductive rights ahead of this year’s presidential election.\n\nHarris, who has helped lead the charge on the administration’s efforts to protect abortion access, will walk through the clinic and speak with staff members, said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe stop in Minnesota is the sixth on her nationwide “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour and is believed to be the first time a president or vice president has visited a clinic that provides abortion services.\n\nHarris will use her visit to highlight how Minnesota has been impacted by abortion bans in other states that threaten women's health and force them to travel out of state to receive care, the official said.\n\nShe will outline what the Biden administration has done to safeguard reproductive rights and highlight efforts by advocates and elected leaders in states like Minnesota to protect those rights following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning of Roe v.

PAUL, Minn. ― Vice President Kamala Harris made a historic visit to an abortion clinic in the Twin Cities Thursday, demanding \"we have to be a nation that trusts women\" and declaring that access to reproductive medical care has spiraled into a \"health crisis.\"\n\nThe visit to the Planned Parenthood facility − the first ever by a president or vice president to a clinic that provides abortion services − marked the most dramatic push by President Joe Biden's reelection campaign to make access to abortion a defining issue in the 2024 election.\n\nHarris, the nation's first female vice president, has become the White House's leading voice on restoring abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending a 50-year constitutional right to an abortion and prompting several Republican-led states to pass laws limiting abortion access.\n\n\"In this environment, these attacks against an individual's right to make decisions about their own body are outrageous and, in many instances, just plain old immoral. How dare these elected leaders believe they are in a better position to tell women what they need, to tell women what is in their best interest?\" Harris said.\n\nThe trip was the final stop of Harris' “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour, which launched in January and included previous visits to Wisconsin, California, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore:Vice President Kamala Harris to make historic visit to abortion clinic in Minnesota\n\nMinnesota, which offers broad access to abortion procedures, has become a safe haven for individuals from other states that have passed bans on abortion over the nearly two years since Roe was overturned.\n\n\"Many of you have asked why am I here at this facility,\" Harris said after touring the St. Paul Health Center - Vandalia, which remained open to patients during her visit. \"It is because right now in our country we are facing a very serious health crisis, and the crisis is affecting many, many people in our country, most of whom are frankly silently suffering.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has set out to relentlessly remind women voters that it was former President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court appointments who led to Roe's dismantling.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a Fox News town hall in January that he's \"proud to have done it\" when asked about the court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. Trump later added that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\n\n\"Let us all recognize who is to blame,\" Harris said, singling out Trump during a campaign rally elsewhere in St. Paul after leaving the clinic. \"He intended for them to take away your freedoms. And it is a decision he brags about.”\n\nHarris was joined at the abortion clinic by Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.\n\nWalz signed legislation last year codifying the \"fundamental right\" to an abortion in the state and repealing the state’s 24-hour waiting period before an abortion.\n\n\"When we talk about clinics such as this, it is absolutely about health care and reproductive health care,\" Harris said. \"So, everyone get ready for the language. Uterus − that part of the body needs a lot of medical care from time to time. Issues like fibroids. We can handle this. Breast cancer screenings. Contraceptive care. That is the kind of work that happens here − in addition, of course, to abortion care.\"\n\nHarris slammed other states for passing laws that \"caused clinics like this to shut down,\" which she said denied women \"vital care\" within any reasonable distance. She spoke in front of a large map showing Planned Parenthood clinics in the organization’s five-state North Central region.\n\nSixteen pink dots noted the presence of clinics in Minnesota, where Walz and the Democratic-controlled state legislature moved to protect abortion access. But Minnesota’s neighbors are barren in comparison, with just four clinics distributed across North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. Only one provides abortions, according to the organization’s website.\n\n\"Since Roe was overturned, I've cared for patients from everywhere − from nearby states like South Dakota and North Dakota and Wisconsin, but from faraway states like Texas, Alabama, Wyoming, Florida, Oklahoma, Missouri, and the list goes on,\" said Sarah Traxler, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood North Central States.\n\nTraxler said the St. Paul abortion clinic has seen a 25% increase in abortions since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe. Out-of-state patients have doubled, she said.\n\n\"Traveling to access essential health care can be intimidating and overwhelming. It is not an easy thing to do as we have all pretended that it is,\" Traxler said.\n\nWhile Biden struggles to convince Americans of an improving economy, according to polls, abortion rights has proven to be a winning issue for Democrats in elections held since 2022.\n\n“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden said in his State of the Union address last week. “But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and we'll win again in 2024.”\n\nMore:Joe Biden boosts abortion, contraception access on Roe v. Wade anniversary\n\nOver the course of the decades-long battle over abortion rights in the U.S., abortion clinics have at times been sites of violent protests and targets of bombings.\n\nAn hour before Harris was scheduled to speak, about two dozen protesters gathered outside the St. Paul Planned Parenthood, holding signs with slogans such as, “life is a human right, “they’re killing babies here,” and “the real war on women.” A heavy police and Secret Service presence surrounded the building in anticipation of the vice president’s arrival.\n\nDiana Halsey, a 70-year-old Minneapolis resident was among those hoisting signs with anti-abortion slogans. She said she stops by the clinic about once a week to pray that the women coming and going “get the help they need.”\n\nShe was surprised to learn that Harris would also be dropping by Thursday and hurried to find a bigger display. As Harris drove by, Halsey’s large “Life is a human right” sign was on immediate display. “It's sad,” she said of Harris’ visit. “I really feel bad about our medical community — that they are not supporting.\"\n\nPaige Robinson, a 22-year-old University of Minnesota student, was among a handful of supporters who gathered outside the clinic Thursday, intermingling with the protesters, trying to catch a glimpse of the vice president as her motorcade exited the building.\n\n“I think it's very cool,” Robinson, a Democrat, said of Harris’ visit. “I know that this is the first time she's ever done it — the first time anyone has ever done something at an abortion clinic, which I think is very neat.\n\n\"And I think it's very cool that it's Minnesota especially, because Minnesota has a pretty good track record. It's nice to see such clear support of our pro-woman policies,\" Robinson said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/05/kamala-harris-culture-warrior-vp-embraces-fight-with-desantis/70504004007/", "title": "Kamala Harris: culture warrior? VP embraces fight with DeSantis", "text": "WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris is embracing a new role as the Republican presidential primary kicks into high gear: culture warrior.\n\nInspired by the traction that her fight against reproductive restrictions gained in the midterms, the Biden campaign says the vice president will zero-in on abortion, voting rights and guns in the coming months.\n\nHarris will rebuke GOP presidential candidates for positions on cultural issues when she believes they’ve crossed a line, her campaign chief of staff said in an interview, much like she did with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on his state’s slavery curriculum.\n\n“She's a fighter,” said Sheila Nix, who was Joe Biden’s campaign chief of staff when he was vice president and is currently advising Harris. “She's not afraid to call out extremism. So she’s going to drive actions and hold Republicans accountable, and then they're forced to respond.”\n\nThe approach has yielded some early success for Harris, who has struggled to mold the vice presidency in a role that works to her political advantage. After she traveled to DeSantis’ home state last month to blast Florida’s education guidelines, Black Republicans and several GOP presidential contenders piled on him, too.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBut the attacks have been deliberate, coming in pre-written remarks, before mostly friendly audiences, where she is sure to attract applause. Her calculated approach to campaigning frequently involves moderated conversations conducted by Democratic activists in settings where she is unlikely to be goaded into veering off message.\n\nDuring one such conversation in Iowa, Harris did not mention DeSantis or the slavery dispute, even though the Florida governor was due to be in the same city that day to speak at a GOP cattle call.\n\nHarris’ recent travel has included a mix of battleground states such as Wisconsin, where she delivered remarks on high-speed internet in Milwaukee and appeared at campaign fundraisers on Thursday.\n\nShe also visited Florida last week to deliver remarks at the African Methodist Episcopal Women’s Missionary Convention in Orlando. The visit coincided with an offer from DeSantis to meet in Tallahassee to discuss the Black history dustup.\n\nThere, she forcefully declared, \"There is no roundtable, no lecture, no invitation we will accept to debate an undeniable fact: There were no redeeming qualities of slavery.”\n\n“And as I said last week when I was again here in Florida: We will not stop calling out and fighting back against extremist so-called leaders who try to prevent our children from learning our true and full history,” she said, without mentioning DeSantis by name.\n\nHarris intentionally visited Jacksonville in July to meet with elected officials, teachers and civil rights leaders in a historically Black neighborhood and deride the state’s newly-released African American history standards.\n\nGoing \"toe-to-toe\" over culture\n\nHer crusade against Black history guidelines in Florida is drawing praise from other Democrats who want to see their party’s leaders push back harder on efforts by Republican presidential candidates to reshape American culture.\n\n“You have to go toe-to-toe with them,” said Marc Morial, a civil rights leader who is close to the White House and the National Urban League’s president and CEO.\n\nCriticizing what he described as an effort by some Republicans to win the next election by dividing the country, Morial said, “People call it culture wars. Culture is really just a proxy term for race, gender and gender identity.”\n\nSome of the vice president’s allies are reluctant to use the terms “wokeism” or “culture wars” to describe issues such as national abortion bans and transgender military service that a subset of the Republican presidential field are campaigning on.\n\nTerminology aside, Democrats say Harris has an opportunity to highlight GOP candidates’ positions on social issues that public polling suggests will not work to their advantage in a general election.\n\n“You might as well get them on record, and put them on the defensive, because Republicans only dig in even more on these issues, in the context of a Republican primary,” said former Harris campaign manager Brian Brokaw. “I think it’s smart politics, and she’s a good messenger on the issues that she has been deployed to focus on.”\n\nHarris has reshuffled her office and her portfolio multiple times since she became vice president. Her allies say the latest iteration plays to her strengths as a former prosecutor and state attorney general. Ahead of the midterm election, she jumped in to support abortion rights as the Supreme Court prepared to reverse Roe.\n\nBut none of the issues she’s tackled so far have had as pronounced an effect as her showdown with DeSantis over his defense of the state’s description of slavery.\n\nFlorida’s social studies standards advise that \"slaves developed skills, which in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\"\n\nDeSantis argued that he did not write the guidelines but has repeatedly offered his support for them. He told Harris in a letter last week that the Biden administration had \"repeatedly disparaged our state and misinformed Americans\" about the state's African American history standards.\n\nBiden has also spoken out. But as an Black woman, Harris has lived experiences, Democrats say, that allow her to address the issue in a very direct way.\n\n“And you can't lose sight of that. She's not talking about some third party, she's talking about herself, her own family, her own upbringing, her own lived experiences,” Morial said. “And with many of these issues, that's an important dynamic.”\n\nEnergizing lethargic Democrats\n\nBiden does not face stiff opposition for the Democratic nomination and has not been campaigning, even though he announced his reelection bid more than three months ago. He has participated in allied groups’ events and fundraised heavily, but he has selectively focused on using official events to promote his economic agenda.\n\nDemocrats worry about voter lethargy, as Republicans and independents tune into the other party’s primary, and say that Harris’ emphasis on cultural issues is helping to energize the party’s base.\n\nAlthough the vice president has a 42% overall favorability rating, 77% of Democrats approve of the way she's handling her job, in a new CNN poll. She has an approval rating of 72% among African Americans.\n\nHarris may not be changing independent voters’ minds, Democrats say, but she is engaging hardcore liberals, demonstrating her value to the ticket and filling a void while Biden runs the country.\n\n“When we hit general election season, when the president actually knows who he will be campaigning against, I really think it's both of them that should be out there on these issues,” MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said.\n\nHailing Harris’ focus on slavery and abortion rights in the meantime, Epting added, “But let's make no mistake: the role has to be executed carefully. Republicans are trying to set traps for Democrats left and right and everywhere we go.\"\n\nDeSantis has sought to capitalize on his fight with Harris, using it to draw attention to his campaign and Biden’s age.\n\n\"I thank her,\" DeSantis said, according to NBC. \"I mean, the more that it’s me versus Harris, because ultimately if you look at the next election, she’s going to be the VP, you know, it’s possible she could end up being president of the United States. And I think voters need to take a hard look at that and see if that’s something that they would want.\"\n\nFormer Harris communications director Ashley Etienne said she viewed the trip to Jacksonville as a “risky” one given Republican presidential candidates’ focus on the vice president in the 2024 election.\n\n“But it was one that she had to take, because the president needs from her not to just have a moment but to really catch fire. And these are the types of issues that she could get the base fired up on,” Etienne said.\n\nBiden and Harris also have a responsibility as role models to make sure that what students are learning is accurate, National Education Association president Becky Pringle said.\n\n\"Whether or not it feels as though...they're taking a risk of some sort by doing that, they're doing what is right. And in this moment, we absolutely need our president and vice president to be speaking on these issues,\" Pringle said.\n\nCalculated campaigning by Harris\n\nHarris’ decisions of when and how to tangle with Republicans have been calculated. She often refers to “so-called leaders” in her remarks without referring to GOP politicians by name.\n\nOn her trip last month to Iowa, while DeSantis and most of the Republican field were in the state, she participated in a moderated conversation on abortion that her office said was attended by health care providers, patients, local leaders, and advocates.\n\nIn her remarks, Harris accused the GOP of pursuing a “national agenda that is about a full-on attack” on Americans’ freedoms and brought up voting, gun violence and LGBTQ+ rights. But she did not refer to DeSantis or their dispute over educational standards.\n\nIn contrast, he took direct aim at her in his remarks.\n\nHarris' campaign chief of staff said the vice president's event focused on abortion because Iowa had just passed a six-week ban.\n\n“That is an issue that she's spent a lot of time talking about and wanted to make sure that we were raising that issue, as well, ahead of the Republican debate,” Nix said.\n\nThe state has more registered Republicans than Democrats and went for former President Donald Trump in the last two presidential elections.\n\nIowa Democratic Party chair Rita Hart said that efforts to control curriculum and not teach history accurately are a “real problem.” But she said, “That's not happening here in Iowa.\"\n\n\"And we've got to make sure that it doesn't happen here in Iowa,\" she said. \"But the things that really matter to folks are making sure that people have the quality of life — that they can have the confidence that we have a future here in Iowa, that our children can live here and raise good families and have the confidence that these culture wars are not going to dominate the day.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/kamala-harris-midterm-campaign-travel-abortion/index.html", "title": "Kamala Harris embarks on midterm campaign swing to boost turnout ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamala Harris is embarking on a targeted burst of midterm campaigning – especially rooted around abortion rights – in an effort to raise her profile after a rocky start as vice president and boost turnout among key segments of the coalition Democrats desperately need for the midterms.\n\nShe’ll be zeroing in on Black, women and younger voters, while keeping up what has been a deliberate outreach to unions, among both leadership and rank-and-file, according to a dozen aides to Harris and others in the White House and beyond familiar with her plans.\n\n“The positioning is not so much about the geography,” said one aide, “but about the demography.”\n\nThe central and uniting theme of her fall will be abortion, an issue that’s already proven to be an animating force for Democratic base voters. Harris was initially reluctant to be the face of the administration’s efforts to champion abortion rights, recoiling from the assumption that she had to be, simply because she is the highest-profile woman in Democratic politics, according to people who’ve spoken with her. But now she’s planning to focus on it as she tries to make the case for Democrats defending their narrow congressional majorities, even as many candidates keep their distance from her.\n\nHarris’ first year as vice president was defined largely by stories of staff infighting, being sidelined and resulting frustration, as CNN has previously reported. But even people close to Harris and within the West Wing who used to insist publicly there weren’t problems with her work and her public presence now speak regularly about how much Harris has improved, and express optimism that she might start to actually make an impression in voters’ minds and pull up poll numbers that are worse than President Joe Biden’s.\n\nWith White House aides privately acknowledging that Biden is not the perfect fit for talking about abortion rights, they’ve been glad to have Harris as the point person for advocates and officials alike. In a speech on Saturday to a meeting of Democratic National Committee members just outside Washington, DC, she laid out why holding onto their razor-thin majority in the Senate would matter for Democrats – and for her.\n\n“I cannot wait,” she said, “to cast the deciding vote to break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights.”\n\nTo many Democratic operatives and officials watching, Harris’ midterm activity is part of a longer arc of preparation for the bigger campaign ahead in 2024. By the spring, Harris will either be a necessarily much higher profile than normal running mate for an already aging president running for reelection – or if the situation changes, suddenly in a short fuse primary campaign to be the replacement nominee herself.\n\n“The next eight months are Rocky punching the beef, running up the stairs,” said one top Democrat who’s spoken to Harris recently.\n\nGetting outside of Washington\n\nThe rescue effort for the recalcitrant vice president began last winter, as her chief of staff, communications director and press secretary were all replaced. Internal and external advisers assured her that her treatment in the media was unfair. The racism and sexism the first female and the first Black vice president felt was absolutely real, they told her.\n\nBut the defensive burrowing in that she had been doing, they warned, was only going to make the situation worse. And it was leaving her more prone to out-of-practice fumbles, like when she laughed at a question last summer about why she hadn’t visited the southern border by saying she also hadn’t been to Europe.\n\nShe kept saying she wanted to get out more, but she needed to actually start getting out more, advisers told the vice president, and build up her confidence and comfort in public in owning her presence on the job.\n\n“All of her assignments before were not as clear cut. If you look at [migration issues related to diplomacy at the] Northern Triangle, look at voting rights, there was no clear way to measure success,” said Cedric Richmond, the former congressman and White House adviser who’s taken on a prime role counseling Harris.\n\n“I just reminded her that she and the President are both the biggest assets that we have,” Richmond said, “and that people need to see her to understand all what she’s been doing and to really hear her.”\n\nAmong the stops already planned are additional trips to Texas and Pennsylvania, and a roundtable scheduled for Friday in Chicago with state legislators, students, abortion providers and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is running against a Trump-endorsed Republican who supports stringent abortion restrictions. Aides expect Harris to be on the road up to three days each week in a mix of events that will include more fundraisers, but most events will be like one CNN has learned she has scheduled for September 22 in Milwaukee at a meeting of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, in a critical swing state, where she’ll highlight the legal fight for abortion rights.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks beside President Joe Biden during an Inflation Reduction Act event on the South Lawn of the White House on Tuesday. Samuel Corum/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWith Biden’s poll numbers cratering in the spring as even core Democrats grew disaffected, White House chief of staff Ron Klain – who served as a chief of staff to two vice presidents – urged Harris’ aides, and her directly, to think about capitalizing on where her appeal was strongest. Black voters were giving up on Democrats and drifting away. Before the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, female voters were too. Younger voters who, for the most part, were never deeply committed to Biden had returned to being blasé at best.\n\nThey’re using the model of Harris’ appearance at the Essence Festival in New Orleans over July Fourth weekend. There’s not a competitive race in the fall anywhere near Louisiana. But there was an audience of 10,000 primarily Black women gathered from across the country to whom she spoke about the “outrageous” Dobbs decision, not very subtly linked the Supreme Court ruling to “a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership over human bodies.”\n\nShe brings her own approach to the issue. In internal conversations at the White House, for example, she’s made the point that they shouldn’t assume Black voters are going to automatically agree with them on championing abortion rights.\n\nAfter her speech at the DNC on Saturday, Harris made a surprise stop in the same hotel to speak to a gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority of Black women to which she belonged at Howard, and urged the women in the room to think of the midterm campaign as service.\n\n“So many women, especially younger women whom we absolutely need, connect to her in a way that they don’t connect with any other leader in the Democratic Party right now who’s front and center,” said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who has advised Harris and her staff.\n\nThat targeted focus will also define Harris’ approach to media interviews. Though she pre-recorded a rare Sunday show appearance with NBC’s “Meet the Press” last weekend, her aides are catering to women’s magazines, Black and Latino television and radio, and a Labor Day-themed, union-focused interview with the left-leaning magazine The Nation. (She declined an interview request from CNN.)\n\n“If you’re going to put together a winning coalition nationally, I would argue it’s more important to be on stage at the Essence Festival than it is to be at the rural county fair,” Belcher said.\n\nSo far Harris’ recalibration isn’t a total revolution. Some of the issues that plagued her start as vice president – inconsistency, endless meetings and prep sessions – remain. Complaints come in from inside and outside the government about hesitation and lack of follow through. “Overthinking” is still a word people who talk with her often use, and caution and anxiety can wrench her words into garbles, such as in the “Meet the Press” interview when she gave a meandering dodge to a question about whether she’d support prosecuting former President Donald Trump.\n\nThough dynamics internally at the White House have improved, Harris and her aides still worry about inadvertently outshining Biden, while trying to carve out her own identity.\n\nHer role, one top Biden adviser said – acknowledging playing off Harris’ original 2020 “prosecutor for president” pitch – is now making the case for Biden.\n\n“For many of the people we’re talking to, it’s the same people we needed to turn out for us in 2020,” another person familiar with Harris’ thinking said. “She feels a sense of responsibility to make them understand what we have delivered on, and to ask them to do it again.”\n\nAnd when making that sell, she likes to get specific, her aides say. She’ll cross out “American Rescue Plan” or “ARP,” for example, if she sees them written in her speeches, and say things like, “Don’t tell me, ‘We’re spending money on bridges.’ Pick a bridge!”\n\nFocusing on abortion\n\nHarris was flying to Chicago when the Dobbs decision came down in late June, but she tore through the majority opinion, dissent and concurrences as Air Force 2 landed, and then in the motorcade to a long-scheduled event that happened to be on maternal health, she scratched notes in the margins.\n\nHarris very quickly started talking about the decision as an assault not on reproductive rights but on “freedom and liberty.” She stressed the importance of talking about the impact on IVF and miscarriages, and the potential future legal action against same-sex marriage.\n\nIn talking with clergy and other faith leaders, she’s urged them to see abortion rights not as a threat to their personal opposition to the procedure, but instead about the government not making decisions for women. She also pressed aides to make sure she isn’t just talking to older faith leaders.\n\nNew aides have built a quiet yet consistent structure of events for her, unlike during her first year on the job. Hosting abortion rights roundtables with local legislators around the country in both red and blue states, Harris has raised their profile with the spotlight a vice presidential visit brings, while offering practical tips like whom to call at the Justice Department taskforce or which legislator in another state might be worth connecting with.\n\nHarris has led internal White House meetings too, with aides saying her experiences as a state attorney general has proven crucial both as they’ve weighed policy moves and in urging everyone involved to use more practical and direct language.\n\n“It helps the President to have her playing a leadership role,” said top Biden adviser Anita Dunn, who’s been part of several one-on-one and group conversations with Harris.\n\nAnd it’s clearly helped Harris too, many around her say.\n\n“She’s found her groove,” said Donna Brazile, a former DNC chair and informal adviser, marveling at how an issue uniting Harris’ legal background and longtime attention to maternal health and equality happened to land right when she needed it.\n\n“She has really been able to help the White House communicate its message on choice, on freedom and on equality – and that matters in a close election.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/16/kamala-harris-planned-parenthood-visit-abortion-debate/72970879007/", "title": "VP Kamala Harris broke politics at an abortion clinic visit. She even ...", "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. ― These are not words politicians use. But Vice President Kamala Harris, already a historic figure, went there when she broke a political barrier by touring a Minnesota-based Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\n“Everyone get ready for the language,” Harris, the nation's first female vice president warned.\n\n\"Uterus.\"\n\nThe crowd broke into laughter. “That part of the body needs a lot of medical care from time to time,\" Harris said.\n\n\"Issues like fibroids\" − muscular tumors that grow in the wall of a woman's uterus − must no longer be taboo. She insisted: \"We can handle this.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDecades ago, it might have made them squirm or denounce it as vulgar.\n\nThe 59-year-old Democrat stood in front of a bouquet of microphones and went into detail about the many services Planned Parenthood provides that are unrelated to abortion.\n\nHarris’ decision to visit the clinic – and her public use of medical terms for the human reproductive system – were the clearest sign yet of how much America's abortion debate has been scrambled ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe decision by the most powerful woman in elected office in the US was a remarkable departure for Democrats, who have historically kept abortion providers at arm's length.\n\nAnd the public is ready for it.\n\nFor Paige Robinson, a 22-year-old University of Minnesota student, abortion is a key issue she’ll be considering when she votes this fall.\n\nHarris's visit, she told USA Today: \"does show a very clear stance from the administration on their support of it, which is a strong thing to do.\"\n\nExperts and activists reiterate how Thursday's trip further reflects how the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe vs. Wade threw out the old rules around abortion.\n\n\"It's both unprecedented and unsurprising given the earthquake of the Dobbs decision,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University.\n\nOthers say this moment also showcases Harris's expanding role as the Biden campaign's progressive crusader-in-chief on social issues.\n\nOn the trail, she has been urgent about women's health being in crisis as part of her \"Fight for Reproductive Freedoms\" tour, which concluded in Minnesota this week after previous stops in battleground states such as Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona.\n\nPoll shows opening with independent women\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released this week underscores one reason why Harris is running toward the abortion issue.\n\nThe vice president is already well liked among fellow Democrats, particularly Democratic women who give her a 78% job approval rating, the survey shows. Her popularity nosedives, however, when she tip-toes outside the party’s tent.\n\nRoughly 54% of all respondents, for instance, said she isn't qualified to serve as president versus 38% who believe she has what it takes.\n\nThat gap shrinks a bit when measured against the views of independent women, who have been at odds with Republicans on reproductive rights.\n\nThe poll shows 45% of independent women think Harris isn’t qualified to be president compared to 40% who think she is qualified.\n\n“Outside of core Democratic voters, she has an opportunity to flip independent women into positive territory. She's negative there, but it's close,” said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.\n\nWhen compared with all voters, Harris gets slightly higher marks on job approval and favorability with women who don't belong to either party, the survey finds.\n\nAmong everyone, Harris has a net negative 16% rating in both the job she’s doing as vice president and her popularity. But with independent women, that drops to a net negative 5% on approval.\n\nOn favorability, the net negative with independent women is 15% but with a larger group of 9% still undecided.\n\nPaleologos said the vice president's failure to gain traction with other constituencies matters at a time when there are legitimate concerns by voters surrounding Biden's age and ability to serve. He said that means her role, and eventually the same for Trump's running mate, will be magnified in the coming months.\n\n\"The fact that she can't really add to the Biden equation for November statistically is a problem, and it's a concern,\" he said.\n\n\"They are aligned and very popular within the Democratic Party, but it’s questionable among independents, and they're going to get nothing among Republicans.\"\n\n'We can't do this without' Harris, advocates say\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of more than 100 supporters at a rally in St. Paul, Harris praised what Minnesota Democrats had accomplished by fortifying women's healthcare access. She also hinted at her hopes about what that could mean for the national elections in November, such as Congress eventually codifying Roe into law.\n\n\"So the victory that you all have wanted to, particularly in the statehouse, have once again demonstrated to our nation just how much progress a Democratic trifecta can make,\" Harris said.\n\nThe vice president didn't mince words when drawing out the choice voters have this fall, saying that the country should, \"all recognize who is to blame\" for the patchwork of laws.\n\n\"The former president, Donald Trump, hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe,\" she said. \"He intended for them to take away your freedoms. And it is a decision he brags about.\"\n\nAbortion rights advocates said Thursday’s event is illustrative of how valuable Harris is to the president in ways snapshot polling can’t capture.\n\nAfter Biden’s annual State of the Union address, for instance, some progressives were reportedly left flat about the president failing to use the word \"abortion\" in his remarks.\n\nBiden instead opted for less politically charged verbiage, according to the Associated Press, such as “reproductive freedom” and the “freedom to choose.”\n\nMini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly known as NARAL Pro-Choice America), said going to a clinic distinguished Harris as someone who could talk to an experience all women share.\n\n\"This has become the most reproductive freedom forward administration in the history of the country, and much respect and affection for Joe Biden, but that wouldn't be happening without Kamala Harris being the tip of the spear,” she said.\n\nJacqueline Ayers, a senior vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, echoed how the Biden administration has been, \"an invaluable champion for sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.\"\n\nShe emphasized how Harris has, \"prioritized traveling across the country to see this access crisis first-hand since the fall of Roe.\"\n\nJeannette Pai-Espinosa, president of Justice & Joy National Collaborative, a national racial and gender advocacy organization, said given the impact restricting abortion has on women of color, Harris's visit feels more poignant.\n\n\"It is a watershed moment not just because the vice president is a woman, but in particular for me a woman of color at this time when there's a lot of hostility, risk and polarization,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a big statement of courage, control and power for her to walk in those doors.\"\n\nPolling has consistently shown Americans broadly support some level of access to abortion rights.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey last year, for instance, found 64% of adults think it should be legal in at least some circumstances.\n\nCoupled with voters in seven states siding with the liberal position on ballot questions since 2022, Biden and his allies have confidence that this will be a decisive subject in November.\n\nAdvocates say Harris's visibility as the woman who is a heartbeat away from the presidency, is an asset too.\n\n“She's authentic on this issue. She understands it. She's the moral conscience of it,\" Timmaraju said. \"She doesn't just speak to the base, she speaks to soft Republican and independent woman as well. We can't do this without her.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/16"}]}

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/10/03/student-debt-snap-medicare-daycare-changes-october/71035527007/", "title": "How student debt, SNAP, Medicare, daycare change can affect your ...", "text": "October is bringing big financial changes to millions of Americans.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, 43 million people will start paying off federal student loans again. A similar number will get a small boost to their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP (formerly food stamps). More than 3 million children may be at risk of losing child care after pandemic emergency money that supported the industry expired Saturday. And finally, 65 million seniors on Medicare will get a chance to tweak their health care plans.\n\nAny one of these things could bring big changes to people’s budgets, which is why we’re breaking down what each of them could mean to your pocketbook.\n\nWill student loans resume in October?\n\nYes.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nBy now, you’ve probably already received a statement from your loan servicer. It details the amount of your monthly federal student loan payments and the interest rate charged on your balance. Millions of people will need to make their first loan payment this month after a three-year pause.\n\nIf you haven’t, get in touch with your loan service right away. Even though you won’t be reported to credit reporting agencies for a year if you miss your payments, interest will accrue. So it’s better to start paying if you can.\n\nOf those making payments, the average monthly student loan payment was $200 to $299, according to Federal Reserve data from 2018 through May 2019. Nearly 3 in 10 adults with outstanding education debt weren’t making payments because deferments are allowed while people are in college, it said.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to receive loan forgiveness, check to see if you owe state taxes on it.\n\nWhat does SNAP do on October 1?\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, kicked in Sunday for SNAP recipients, meaning you may see a boost in your check starting this month.\n\nThe maximum monthly amount a family of four can receive is now $973, from $939. The maximum a single person can receive increases to $291 from $281. On the other end, the minimum benefit in most places will remain at $23 for up to a two-person household.\n\nThough the COLA increase is likely welcomed by SNAP recipients, it won’t fully make up for the loss this year of pandemic-related emergency boosts. By March, the last of the pandemic supplement expired. Every SNAP household saw at least $95 a month less, but some saw reductions of $250 a month or more, according to the nonpartisan research and policy institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe average person received about $90 a month less in SNAP benefits after the increase lapsed, it said.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, 41.5 million people a month, or 12.5% of U.S. residents, used SNAP, the Department of Agriculture said. In fiscal year 2019, 43% of all SNAP participants were children and 16% were at least 60, it said.\n\nWhy childcare prices might rise\n\nChild care already costs an average of $1,031 a year more than public college tuition, according to lending platform NetCredit. Now that pandemic-related child care emergency funding has expired, parents could see that gap widen even further.\n\nThe $24 billion Child Care Stabilization Program, passed through the American Rescue Plan of 2021, allocated funding to more than 220,000 child care programs and covered as many as 9.6 million children, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That program expired Saturday.\n\nWithout the additional funding, child care programs may be forced to close. More than 70,000 child care programs could close, according to The Century Foundation, a progressive public policy think tank. More than 3 million children are at risk of losing their child care spots, it said.\n\nThe ones that remain open may have to raise prices, experts said, leaving some families perilously close to falling off a financial cliff.\n\nChildcare cliff hanger:Sept. 30 may represent child care cliff as emergency federal funding runs dry\n\nStudent loans:Should you refinance?\n\nMedicare open enrollment to begin\n\nMore than 65 million Americans will soon get a chance to switch their health care plans with Medicare’s open enrollment beginning Oct. 15 and running through Dec. 7.\n\nDuring open enrollment, people with Medicare can change their health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs − whether dictated by health changes, finances or something else.\n\nOnly about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries compare plans during the open enrollment period, according to the nonprofit KFF, which focuses on health care policy. But experts strongly encourage you to review your coverage because plans often change, especially drug coverage, and you may end up paying more.\n\nEach year, Medicare health and drug plans can change things like cost, coverage, and what providers and pharmacies are in their networks.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nHome owners, renters and potential buyers look at housing and the real estate market from different, often conflicting perspectives.\n\nThere are alarming headlines for all three in recent weeks:\n\nThis convergence speaks to the larger problem of a shortage of affordable housing in the US, as well as the broad issue of affordability, and leads to stories like this: Majority of Americans say they’re worried about being able to pay for housing.\n\nI went to Anna Bahney, the CNN Business writer focused on real estate, to understand why there’s a housing shortage and what, if anything, anyone is doing about it.\n\nOur conversation, conducted by email, is below.\n\nA housing shortage, an affordability crisis\n\nWHAT MATTERS: I have read both that there’s a housing shortage and that there’s a housing crisis. Is there a difference between those ideas – a shortage and a crisis? And is the problem that there literally aren’t enough houses for the number of people in the US?\n\nBAHNEY: The “housing crisis” is actually an “affordability crisis.” Part of the reason housing has become so expensive for Americans is because there is a national shortage of homes. Record low interest rates during the pandemic coupled with more than a decade of under building created a supply and demand mismatch that has pushed home prices higher.\n\nThe US has fallen behind by about 5.5 million housing units over the past 20 years as builders failed to keep up with historical building trends. If you add in property destruction due to demolition or natural disasters, among other things, the total shortfall could be 6.8 million during that time, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThis is a gap so deep that it would take more than a decade to catch up. But even if more homes and apartments are built, it won’t matter unless people can afford them.\n\nMortgage rates are the highest they have been since 2008 and home prices remain near record highs, pricing many prospective homebuyers out of the market. Those people then remain in the already tight rental market, pushing rents up even further.\n\nAs tenants reach the limits of what they can afford to pay each month, homeownership gets further out of reach as they struggle to save for a down payment. This widens the wealth gap and locks in place inequities between those who benefit financially from homeownership and those who don’t. It also widens the racial home ownership gap, in which 72% of White Americans are homeowners while only 43% of Black Americans own a home.\n\nThe cost of housing is driving inflation\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The cost of housing has been cited as a cause of inflation. To what extent is that true and what is the market force that could lower the cost of housing?\n\nBAHNEY: The soaring cost of housing has been a key driver of inflation. For most people, housing is their biggest expense. About one-third of the Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to track inflation, is the “shelter” component.\n\nLast month, the index showed that inflation was worse than expected and the housing component had risen 6.2% from a year ago, the biggest increase since 1991. Stubbornly high inflation means that the Federal Reserve will likely take aggressive action at its meeting next week with either a 75 basis-point hike in interest rates, or potentially a 100 basis-point hike.\n\nBut there are some early signs of cooling in the housing market. Home sales have been dropping for six months in a row as the rising cost to buy and finance a home pushes more people out of the housing market. As demand dries up, prices will come down and eventually mortgage rates will settle.\n\nWhere is the housing shortage felt the worst?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Which parts of the country are most affected by this problem?\n\nBAHNEY: Cities in the Sun Belt like Phoenix and Austin saw some of the biggest increases in housing costs during the pandemic. In Miami the price of a home is up 33% from a year ago, and rents are up 26% from last year. But the affordability crisis is happening nationally, in all regions of the country.\n\nThe median-priced house now costs $749 more per month\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The Fed’s medicine for inflation is to raise interest rates, which has driven up mortgage rates. That might control sales prices, but won’t it make the cost of housing more expensive?\n\nBAHNEY: The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates in order to stem inflation, which may reduce demand but also makes the cost of buying a home even more expensive.\n\nBut the Fed doesn’t set the rate borrowers pay on mortgages directly. Instead, mortgage rates tend to track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury. As investors anticipate the Fed’s rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and, with it, mortgage rates.\n\nThe rate on a typical 30-year-fixed mortgage has more than doubled from a year ago, making a home purchase that was possible then, out of reach for some today.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $359,900 home and financed the rest with a mortgage rate of 2.86% – which was the average at the time – had a monthly payment of $1,192.\n\nToday, a homeowner buying the median priced home, which is now $403,800, with a mortgage at the current average of 6.02%, would pay $1,941 a month in principal and interest. That’s $749 more every month.\n\nAmericans are now spending more than 35% of their median income on monthly principal and interest payments on that median-priced home. Historically, Americans spent closer to 25% of their median income on payments.\n\nTo get back to that level, some combination of these things would need to happen, according to mortgage data company Black Knight: a person’s income would need to grow by 40%, mortgage rates would have to be cut in half, or there would need to be a 30% drop in the median price of a house.\n\nNone of those are likely to happen any time soon.\n\nHomeownership is getting out of reach\n\nWHAT MATTERS: If housing prices go down, it will mean millions of people lose value in their main asset. If housing prices don’t go down, it means millions of Americans will never own a home. It seems like an impossible situation.\n\nBAHNEY: Some housing economists have been saying lately that the housing industry is in a recession, but homeowners aren’t feeling that way. Sure, there are plenty of examples of cooling in the housing industry (mortgage firm layoffs, home builders pulling back, home sales falling). But homeowners still have tremendous equity in their homes, which has risen by an average of $60,000 in the past year.\n\nStill, millions of people are being shut out of homebuying as the affordability challenges prove insurmountable.\n\nIn April 2021, a household had to earn about $80,000 a year to afford payments on the median-priced home with a modest down payment of 3.5%. A year later, the income requirement was $108,000. This cost increase means that about 4 million renter households that could have bought the median-priced home last year could no longer do so 12 months later.\n\nHow can this problem be fixed?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What are some of the ideas to fix this problem? Is there an effective way the government can act?\n\nBAHNEY: Most housing policy experts say that building a steady supply of new, moderately priced homes is job number one. But because those homes are not as profitable for builders as larger, higher-priced homes, it will take a concerted effort by both public and private sectors.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced a Housing Supply Action Plan to close the affordability gap and ease housing costs. The plan aims to boost the supply of affordable housing by enhancing existing federal financing and incentivizing areas to reform zoning and land use policies to build more lower-cost housing. It also calls for homebuilders to adopt more efficient construction methods.\n\nBut none of this is a quick fix, and some of it requires congressional action.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Housing Finance Administration, which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has announced plans this summer to expand home financing options for buyers, particularly those of color, to close the racial homeownership gap. These programs include down payment assistance, lower mortgage insurance premiums and a credit reporting system that factors in rent payment history.\n\nSome of these ideas, including new zero down payment loans with no closing costs for buyers in specific Black or Hispanic neighborhoods, are already in place.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

College may no longer be ...", "text": "Parents spend a lot of time worrying about how they’ll afford college tuition for their kids someday, but a pair of recent surveys show exorbitant college-like costs actually come much earlier in life.\n\nIn more than half the states, child care costs more than in-state public college tuition, according to lending platform NetCredit.com. Then, comes the price you pay for independent kids. Teen car ownership now also costs more than in-state tuition at a public university, an analysis by car app Jerry shows.\n\nEveryone already knows raising a child is expensive, but it’s getting even pricier. After two years of elevated inflation, families are feeling pinched more than ever. Overall, for example, parents spend a significant portion of their annual income on child-related expenses. Nationwide, families spend 19% of their annual income on child-rearing expenses, online lending marketplace LendingTree said.\n\n“Ideally, you’d be able to keep child care costs to 10% or less of your total income,” said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. “But that’s laughably unrealistic for millions of Americans.”\n\nHow expensive is child care?\n\nOn average, child care costs $1,031 a year more than public college tuition, NetCredit said.\n\nLower your auto insurance costs: Find the best car insurance of 2023\n\nNetCredit examined the average annual fees paid for public in-state college tuition and the average cost of child care in each state and calculated the difference between the two. Then, it compared these costs to local average salaries to find the affordability of child care and in-state college tuition in every state.\n\nIn 28 out of 50 states, child care tops in-state tuition, it said. Hawaii has the largest gap: Annual child care costs a whopping $15,995 more than a year of tuition. New York is a close second with a $15, 951 gap between child care and college costs.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Vermont’s annual child care costs were $5,423 less than in-state public college tuition, NetCredit said. That’s followed by South Carolina, a distant second, with child care $3,679 below annual tuition.\n\nHow expensive is it for a teenager to own a car?\n\nIt costs $11,378 a year for a teen to own and drive a new car, more than the average annual in-state tuition at a four-year public university, estimated at $10,940, Jerry said.\n\nTo find this, Jerry used AAA’s driving costs calculator and added the difference ($829) in insurance costs between teen drivers and those over 19 years old. It set annual mileage at 10,000, the choice closest to the 7,200 miles a year driven by the average teen, according to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration.\n\nWhen comparing increases in tuition and the costs of car ownership, it compared the College Board’s tuition in the 2017-18 academic year with the 2022-23 school year, and car ownership costs from the end of 2018 through July 2023.\n\nNot every teen gets new wheels, of course, but even owning a used car can add up. The annual $10,276 cost to own a five-year-old Toyota Camry exceeds in-state tuition at the flagship public university in 13 states and is just $664 less than the average for all four-year public universities, Jerry said.\n\nAt $14.08 per hour – the average wage for fast food workers, lifeguards, retail salespeople, and amusement and recreation attendants – a teen would have to work 49 hours a week over a 15-week summer, or 14 hours every week for a year, to cover the cost of owning and driving a 2018 Toyota, assuming it’s financed, Jerry said.\n\n“No wonder some studies have concluded that shifting economics explains much of the difference in attitudes toward driving and car ownership among Millennials and Gen Z,” wrote Jerry’s Henry Hoenig.\n\nWhy are child care costs surging?\n\nDemand for child care has risen in the past couple of decades in line with the number of two-income households, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.\n\nIn 2019, the public policy nonprofit Center for American Progress said about half of U.S. children spend at least some time in a licensed child care facility.\n\nPair that with the pandemic, which fueled sudden wage growth for child care workers as centers worked to attract and retain workers much like other businesses. As of October 2021, average hourly earnings for child care workers had risen 10.4% to $16.44 from the prior year – on top of already above-average wage growth of 4.3% between September 2019 and September 2020, and much stronger than the 5.8% wage growth for other workers, it said.\n\nIn July, annual child care costs were up 6% from a year earlier, around twice the pace of overall inflation of 3.2%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nChildcare woes hurt everyone:Childcare crisis: What costly daycare and fewer workers mean for US economy and taxpayers\n\nWhy are car ownership costs climbing?\n\nBlame soaring prices for auto insurance, maintenance and car repairs, vehicle prices and parts, and gasoline. Since 2018, they’ve all risen at least three times faster than tuition at four-year state universities, Jerry said.\n\nAnd don’t expect car ownership to get much cheaper any time soon. “As interest rates continue to climb, this adds a layer of expense per month that consumers should consider when shopping for their next vehicle,” said Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive research. The Fed has projected it will raise its benchmark, short-term fed funds rate one more time this year by a quarter point to a range of 5.5% to 5.75%.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

From 2019 to 2022, the median net worth of American families jumped 37% to $192,900, after adjusting for inflation. It’s the largest increase ever recorded by the federal Survey of Consumer Finances, released last fall. Surging home values and rising stock ownership fed the surge.\n\nSome of the new numbers are startling. Average household net worth now tops $500,000 for Americans in their late 30s. For late-40-somethings, it exceeds $750,000. For 50-somethings, it reaches seven figures.\n\nIf you’re a 50-something and you’re not worth a cool $1 million, do not despair. Those numbers are averages, and the super-rich drive them waaaay up.\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nThe “median” American household – picture the middle number in a long list of numbers – achieves a net worth of about $300,000 in the 50-to-59 age range, a far cry from $1 million.\n\nAnd those figures are from 2022. By many accounts, Americans' net worth continues to rise.\n\nOne component is retirement savings. The average 401(k) account balance rose 14% to $118,600 in 2023, according to Fidelity Investments.\n\nHome values, too, continue their upward march. The median sale price for existing homes rose from $360,800 to $384,500 between February 2023 and February 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThe 1%:The wealthiest American earners now own more wealth than the entire middle class\n\nHere is how net worth breaks down, decade by decade\n\nTo illustrate how wealth stacks up over the years, here is a decade-by-decade breakdown of net worth in America.\n\n20-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $120,896 (ages 20-24), $120,185 (ages 25-29)\n\nMedian net worth: $10,800 (ages 20-24), $30,160 (ages 25-29)\n\nIn our 20s, most of us are just starting out. We’re working our first jobs at relatively low pay. We’re digging out of student debt. On the upside, we probably don’t have many other expenses.\n\n“You’re off on your own for the first time,” said Liz Gillette, a certified financial planner in Edgewater, Maryland. “You’ve got liabilities coming in, like your first car, your student loans. And then, you’re just building your way toward saving for retirement.”\n\nFor 20-somethings, “the biggest factor is debt,” said Jonathan Swanburg, a certified financial planner in Houston. “You’ve accumulated a bunch of school debt, and you haven’t had a chance to work, so your net worth is often in the negative. You’re just trying to get out of the hole.”\n\n30-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $258,073 (ages 30-34), $501,289 (ages 35-39)\n\nMedian net worth: $89,801 (ages 30-34), $141,200 (ages 35-39)\n\nAmericans in their 30s may be emerging from college debt, buying a first house and starting a family. Their income is probably rising, but so are their expenses. Think diapers.\n\n“Let’s say that they’ve accomplished getting out of most of their debt,” Swanburg said. “They’re starting to put some money into 401(k)s. And that basically starts the process of going into the positive.”\n\nMany 30-somethings begin to experience the miracle of compounding: watching the investments they made in their 20s rise in value as interest accrues on the initial investment and on the interest already earned.\n\nCompound interest helps explain how average net worth reaches $500,000 for people in their late 30s.\n\n“Maybe you started investing at 25,” Gillette said. “Now, you’re 35. That money has now had 10 years to grow.”\n\n40-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $590,718 (ages 40-44), $781,923 (ages 45-49)\n\nMedian net worth: $134,730 (ages 40-44), $212,800 (ages 45-49)\n\nWhen we reach our 40s, that house we purchased in our 30s builds serious equity as the balance of mortgage payments shifts from interest to principal. We’re entering our top earning years. If we have children, they’re getting more expensive.\n\n“People probably have gotten married, bought a home, had kids,” said Peter Lazaroff, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “It’s what I would call full-on adulting.”\n\nHome equity and appreciation help push average net worth toward the upper six figures, along with the aforementioned miracle of compounding.\n\n“If you had a 30-year mortgage,” Swanburg said, “you’re probably halfway done with it.”\n\n50-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $1,132,532 (ages 50-54), $1,442,075 (ages 55-59)\n\nMedian net worth: $272,800 (ages 50-54), $320,700 (ages 55-59)\n\nWelcome to Millionaires' Row. In their 50s, many Americans attain the mythical status of millionaire, their household assets worth at least $1 million more than their liabilities.\n\nOur house may now be our prize possession, rising in value as we enter the final years of our mortgage. If we started saving for retirement in our 20s, then our 401(k) is a wonder to behold after reaping 5% to 10% returns for many years.\n\n“By the time you’re in your 50s, most of what’s in your retirement account is compounded interest,” Lazaroff said.\n\nYour children may be in college, one of the biggest expenses you and they will ever incur. But then they’re done, and your nest is empty. You start planning in earnest for retirement.\n\n“There does seem to be something magical about turning 50 and saying, ‘I’d better get myself in gear here,’” Gillette said.\n\n60-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $1,675,214 (ages 60-64), $1,836,884 (ages 65-69)\n\nMedian net worth: $394,010 (ages 60-64), $394,300 (ages 65-69)\n\nThis is the decade when average net worth peaks, a figure close to $2 million for Americans in their late 60s.\n\nOur 60s is when many of us retire and begin drawing down our accumulated wealth.\n\n“You are asking (people) to flip a switch and to suddenly start spending down their money,” Gillette said.\n\nYet, for affluent households with decades of investments to draw upon, “you’re living off the income,” she said. “You’re not even touching the principal.”\n\n70-somethings\n\nAverage net worth: $1,714,085 (ages 70-74), $1,629,256 (ages 75-79)\n\nMedian net worth: $433,100 (ages 70-74), $341,300 (ages 75-79)\n\nIn their 70s, Americans watch their net worth finally begin to decline.\n\nWe are probably not working any longer, and we’re gradually depleting our retirement nest egg. Many expenses are dwindling, but others are rising − especially health care.\n\n“You’re in the spend-down phase,” Swanburg said, “drawing down the 401(k) rather than building it up.”\n\nTime to give CDs a spin?Certificate of deposit interest rates are highest in years\n\nWealthier families may still be earning more than they spend: A retirement fund of $1.5 or $2 million can kick off a lot of income. Less affluent families may be relying on Social Security.\n\nIf you’re approaching your 70s and you don’t have a seven-figure net worth, you are not doomed to live out your days in poverty, the experts say: Every budget is different.\n\n“How much money you need is entirely dependent on how much you spend,” Swanburg said. “Someone who has less than the average but doesn’t spend very much can be very, very wealthy.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/20/mortgage-loans-risk-financial/7355357001/", "title": "Unable to get a mortgage, millions of Americans turn to risky lenders ...", "text": "At least 1 in 5 Americans have used alternative financing, meaning many low-income buyers are purchasing homes at higher costs and less favorable terms.\n\nTypical alternative financing arrangements include land contracts, seller-financed mortgages, lease-purchase agreements and personal property loans.\n\nExperts worry many low-income Americans turned to risky financial agreements amid the pandemic-fueled rush to homeownership.\n\nWhen Yvonne Maldonado bought her New York mobile home, she thought she had found a cost-efficient place where she could live out her golden years.\n\nBut the deal soon soured after the purchase of the three-bedroom home in the Silver Stream Village Manufactured Home Community in New Windsor, a small town about 60 miles north of New York City.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/25/daily-briefing-a-454-million-deadline/73089264007/", "title": "Trump legal cases, Russia shooting, Congress spending bill ...", "text": "Monday is former President Donald Trump's deadline to put up a bond or make a deposit of more than $450 million to shield his assets while he appeals a New York civil fraud trial loss.

In his church choir, he can’t always hear his part and get the pitch right. It’s also affected his work at the Fire Safety Research Institute, a nonprofit that generates safety research. The 61-year-old said he feels less effective judging audio quality when his team makes their life-saving videos for firefighters.\n\n“It is affecting all parts of my life,” he said.\n\nHe saw an audiologist who said he needed hearing aids, but they would have cost him more than $6,000. “I thought, ‘Maybe this can wait,’ ” Couste said.\n\nThat was seven years ago.\n\nThe wait may be over for Couste and millions of other Americans. On Monday, for the first time, adults with mild to moderate hearing loss in the US will be able to buy over-the-counter hearing aids. Those who are under 18 or who have severe hearing loss will still need a prescription.\n\nHelp for millions\n\nIn July, President Joe Biden signed an executive order meant to promote competition; it encouraged the US Food and Drug Administration allow over-the-counter, prescription-free hearing aids, and the FDA announced the long-awaited rule change in August. The move ushers in options that should be cheaper and possibly even better.\n\nNow, instead of getting a prescription and having a custom fitting with a hearing health professional, adults can buy hearing aids directly from a store or online. Some doctors estimate that 90% of the population with hearing loss could benefit from these over-the-counter devices.\n\nExperts say the move is a “game-changer.”\n\n“We’ve been working for years for affordable and accessible hearing health care,” said Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America. “We’re really looking forward to Monday.”\n\nCouste is certainly not alone in forgoing hearing aids because they were too expensive, Kelley said. Only about 16% of the tens of millions of people with hearing loss use a hearing aid, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.\n\nThe number of people with hearing loss is substantial. About 1 in 8 people in the US ages 12 and older has hearing loss in both ears, and the rate increases significantly with age. About a quarter of people 65 to 74 have hearing loss, and that goes up to 50% around age 75.\n\nOn average, people spend at least $4,000 out of pocket for devices for both ears, according to a 2020 study published in the medical journal JAMA. Prices can vary: Large retailers may offer a pair for about $1,400, but some can cost as much as $6,000 per ear, depending on the technology.\n\nThe FDA rule allowing for over-the-counter hearing aids didn’t change how the devices are covered. While private insurers pay for treatment after the loss of a limb or even cover the cost of Viagra, most do not cover hearing aids. Most Medicare plans won’t pay for them, either. Only about half of state Medicaid programs do.\n\nMore competition, more advances\n\nUntil now, five companies have controlled 90% of the global marketplace for hearing aids. That kind of consolidation meant there was little price competition.\n\nWith the change, many more companies are expected to enter the market. Experts say that existing manufacturers will also develop lower-cost over-the-counter devices in addition to their current offerings.\n\nThe White House said Monday that hearing aids are available or coming soon at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Best Buy and Hy-Vee, with some models priced as low as about $200 for a pair.\n\nSony has a couple of models that pair with an app that lets users personalize settings and find additional support. The CRE-C10 sells for $999.99 and has a battery life for up to 70 hours of continuous use. The CRE-E10 has more of an earbud-like design and a rechargeable battery; it is Bluetooth compatible to stream music or audio. It will be available for $1,299.99 on the Sony website and at Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers.\n\nBose also teamed up with Lexie Hearing to offer the B1 model for $899 a pair. The B2, for $999, adds a rechargeable battery that works for up to 18 hours. Both models are Bluetooth-enabled, can be tuned by the wearer and pair with a mobile app for support. They’ll be sold online, at drugstores and at stores like Best Buy.\n\nBest Buy says that nearly 300 of its stores will offer a “hearing experience,” which will include about 10 over-the-counter hearing aids and PSAPs, or personal sound amplification products. Those enhance sound but don’t need to meet FDA standards, unlike hearing aids, which have to meet the FDA’s high standards for labeling, manufacturing and safety, like other medical devices.\n\nBest Buy is encouraging customers to take a hearing assessment on its website before coming into the store to work with trained associates to pick out a new device.\n\nWhy hearing aids matter\n\nHearing aids aren’t just nice to have; they are essential for physical and mental health.\n\nPeople with hearing loss who do not have hearing aids are more likely to report poor health overall, and they are less likely to leave home or exercise, studies have found.\n\nThere’s a link between hearing loss and general frailty and an increasing risk of falls, which are the second leading cause of unintentional deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Association.\n\nSeveral studies have also found an link between hearing loss and poorer mental health and psychosocial health.\n\nHearing loss can lead to depression, loneliness and isolation – even dementia.\n\nWith hearing aids becoming easier to access, “I have a big smile on my face right now,” said Dr. Frank Lin, director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health. He has been consulting with the government on this issue for eight years.\n\nLin said there has been little innovation in this space because of the way the market has been regulated.\n\n“In 1977, because of the technology at the time, the only way for hearing aids to be safe and effective is if they were programmed and fitted and professionally adjusted by a licensed provider,” he said. “But the market and that technology has changed dramatically.\n\n“This will allow companies like Samsung, Apple, Google – companies that are already making innovative earbuds – they can now enter the market. They really couldn’t before.”\n\nWhat to look for\n\nKelley said that if you plan to buy an OTC hearing aid, make sure to read the return policy. The FDA did not require companies to offer one, as Kelley’s group pushed, but any return policy should be listed on the package.\n\nCheck how long you have before you can return them, too. Hearing aids are different than glasses; it can take your brain up to four weeks to adjust to hearing in a new way.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTest them in different circumstances over a few weeks to see whether they’re the right fit. Do they help in a crowded room, or are they better at work? It’s not one size fits all.\n\nCouste said he will check with his insurance company to see whether it will pick up any of the cost of an OTC device. But finally, after all these years, he thinks he’ll soon be able to hear better.\n\n“I am looking forward to it,” Couste said. “I truly am.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/voter-inequality-us-democracy-what-matters/index.html", "title": "See how your votes aren't equal | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’ve heard how US democracy can be undemocratic; the candidate who gets fewer votes is routinely elected president because of the Electoral College.\n\nBut the inequality of American democracy goes much deeper. While US citizens 18 years and older get a vote, one person’s vote goes much further than another’s. And a person from Wyoming has the most powerful vote of all.\n\nOne major reason is the size of the House of Representatives, which is frozen at 435.\n\nCongress used to grow with the population\n\nHouse seats are split up among the states — a process called apportionment — every 10 years after the census.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a skyrocketing population driven by immigration fueled fear among many rural lawmakers of the growing power of cities.\n\nA dispute after the 1920 census ultimately led Congress to cap the size of the House at 435 seats.\n\nIt temporarily grew after the addition of Hawaii and Alaska as states, but has basically stayed the same for more than 100 years.\n\nThe number of representatives is frozen, but the US population has exploded\n\nIn 1910, just before the House reached 435 members, there were 46 states and the official census population was 92,228,496 people in the US.\n\nIn 2020, that same number — 435 members of the House — represented 50 states, and the official census population was 331,449,281.\n\nWhere the average House member used to represent around 200,000 people in 1910, today it is approaching 800,000.\n\nNot only does this put lawmakers further from the individual people they represent, but it also means different members of the House might represent a very different number of people.\n\nCompare two similarly sized states:\n\nDelaware had a population of 989,948 in 2020.\n\nMontana had a population of 1,084,225 in 2020.\n\nThat’s a difference of 94,277 people.\n\nBut Delaware gets the minimum one representative in the House.\n\nMontana, based on those 94,277 additional people, will get a second representative for the first time in the 2022 election.\n\nDelaware’s House member will represent nearly 1 million people.\n\nMontana’s two House members will represent about 500,000 people each.\n\n26 people can make a huge difference\n\nThe above are the most extreme examples. Each member of the House represents somewhere between about a million people and a little more than 500,000, a large range.\n\nThe difference between losing a seat and keeping it can be incredibly thin. After the 2020 census, Minnesota maintained its eighth congressional seat by a margin of 26 people over New York.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nCounting 26 people determined a full decade of congressional representation.\n\nMillions of Americans get no say in Congress\n\nWashington, DC, has a larger population than Wyoming, but it gets no federal lawmakers who can vote, compared with Wyoming’s House member and two senators. The same is true for more than 3 million Puerto Ricans, who have even less power because they can only take part in presidential elections if they leave their home to live in a state or Washington, DC.\n\nMost countries have a lot more representatives per person. The United Kingdom has 650 members of Parliament, or a little less than one member per about 100,000 people. Each member represents a fraction of the people a US House member represents.\n\nThe size of the House could be unwieldy if Congress was to grow. As the founders envisioned it, the House could have more than 11,000 members today. Something in between could be better.\n\nJust try reading all the mail\n\nThere are real-world consequences to having so few representatives for so many people.\n\nA sample congressional office that received 9,300 messages in 2001 got 123,000 in 2017, according to an analysis by the Congressional Management Foundation.\n\nMore constituents means more work for each lawmaker, but the number of congressional staffers has fallen dramatically. So has the number of bills enacted. Congress is getting more diluted and less efficient as the same number of people represent a vastly larger country.\n\nThe growing distance between lawmakers and the people has changed the power of states\n\nNew York once had more than 40 representatives. Today it has 26.\n\nPennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois have also lost power. California, for the first time, lost a House member after the 2020 census.\n\nTexas, Florida and other Sun Belt states are growing. Texas, in particular, has used partisan gerrymandering to keep the state reliably controlled by conservatives in the House, even though its growth is driven by cities and minority populations.\n\nHow to make the US more democratic\n\nCongress could vote to uncap the size of the House, and there are plenty of good-government groups pushing this type of reform, although it is not top of mind in Washington. The arguments and options are included in a review by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Here are a few:\n\nIdea 1: Apply the Wyoming Rule, where every district is approximately the same size as the least populous state: Wyoming.\n\nUnder that model, California would grow to nearly 70 seats. Texas would have more than 50. Montana and Delaware would probably be about equal based on their similar population size of around 1 million people.\n\nIdea 2: Use the Cube Root Rule, where the cube root of the US population is used.\n\n∛331 million people, as of the 2020 census, would be 692 members of the House, according to the American Academy’s math.\n\nEither method would make for a more equal and a much larger Congress.\n\nIdea 3: Add 150 lawmakers. The authors of the American Academy study ultimately recommend simply expanding the size of the House by 150 members and periodically adding more members as the population grows.\n\nNone of these proposals would address the other major problem affecting democracy in the House, which is gerrymandering.\n\nParties in states have become sophisticated in their ability to draw congressional maps. Some states have created nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to remove some of the political gamesmanship, but another idea put forward is to have lawmakers represent multiple districts, giving more people a voice.\n\nThe Constitution actually gives great latitude to how Congress should be made up. At periods, some large states like New York have had at-large districts in addition to their mapped districts.\n\nThen there’s the Senate, where equality for states equals inequality for Americans\n\nThere is an even greater imbalance in the Senate, where each state, by the design of the framers of the Constitution and regardless of a state’s size, gets two senators.\n\nBut states, most of which did not exist when the Constitution was written, have grown unevenly. Some populations have exploded while others have stayed relatively static.\n\nCalifornia is one of the largest economies in the world, but in the Senate, its two senators are on par with Rhode Island and Wyoming, which have comparatively minuscule economies.\n\nRepublicans of the late 1800s actually pushed to quickly expand the number of states, thinking it would help them consolidate power. They added six states — 12 senators — in two years, in 1889 and 1890, creating a wildly different balance of power on Capitol Hill. Generations later, that imbalance is still helping Republicans, although the two parties of today bear almost no resemblance to their former selves.\n\nAnd finally, the Electoral College\n\nHouse and Senate representation converge in the Electoral College, where states have electors equal to their senators plus their House members. Using 2010 census data, as I wrote in 2018, California has about 12% of the population, but its 55 electors equal a smaller share of the Electoral College.\n\nWhich means each Californian voter has the least individual say at the presidential level. Because it has the smallest population and two senators, Wyomingites have the most say. There’s one presidential elector for every 192,000 or so of them, which makes for a very lopsided say in their government.", "authors": ["Zachary B. Wolf"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}

Behind me are 45 states and at least a quarter of all the countries on the planet. Southern Crete — a rugged, mountainous place bordering the Libyan Sea — has been my happy place with close friends since 2004.\n\nBut this summer, my small black roller bag is racking up miles faster than the most rabid \"Pokemon Go\" player.\n\nI’ve been told that it may have gone from Heraklion to Rome and on to Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., in just the past 20 days.\n\nAnd it’s still not home.\n\nI know what you’re thinking: You should know better than to check a bag.\n\nRight? Didn’t we all see the stories of jaw-dropping security lines this summer at major airports?\n\nIn my defense, I haven’t checked a bag in years. That’d be breaking Rule No. 1 of the veteran air traveler: Keep it light.\n\nRELATED: Report: Airlines are losing fewer bags\n\nMy excuse: I had to attend a five-day journalism conference in New Orleans right before my 10-day vacation. All the professional and recreational necessities couldn’t fit into one carry-on.\n\nBut I have to confess that, even as a journalist, I didn’t know how bad complaints had gotten with American, the airline I booked for the work trip and vacation, until the black roller went rogue.\n\nAs it turned out, the suitcase didn’t make it to New Orleans until the day after my flight out. And it has been lost, at least twice so far, on its way home from Greece.\n\nHeavy baggage: Consumer complaints\n\nLast year, airline complaints shot up 30 percent — a 15-year high, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nThe government received more than 20,000 complaints from consumers in 2015, or about 5,000 more than were filed the previous year. And that's just those made to the DOT.\n\nAmerican Airlines, the world’s largest carrier, was at the top of the pack, with about 4,000 DOT complaints last year. United was second, with about 2,700, Spirit had nearly 2,100 and Frontier had just over 1,000.\n\nDelta, typically my go-to airline for travel from Des Moines, had 1,025.\n\nAfter completing its merger with US Airways in 2015, American dominated the rankings in almost every complaint category. It had the most complaints about flight problems (1,094), baggage (601), reservations (506), fares (479), customer service (426), refunds (415), disability issues (183) and over-sold flights (152), according to Forbes.\n\nThe Forbes article concluded that most airlines are performing better operationally, but they are alienating customers with draconian rules and unfriendly service.\n\nMy suitcase was checked onto a flight on Vueling Airlines, a Spanish airline that has a baggage agreement with American, when I left Heraklion late last month. It was supposed to be transferred the same day, in Rome, to an American flight to New York.\n\nThe Vueling agent assured me there was no need to pick up my suitcase after going through customs in Rome. She said to just give the bag-tracking number to the American agent when I picked up my new ticket in Rome and the bag would be transferred.\n\nI did that. And when I got to my gate in Rome, I checked again to make sure the suitcase and its tracking number were registered on my American flight to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.\n\nBut after I waded through customs again for more than an hour, the bag never emerged onto the carousel in New York.\n\nRELATED: Tips to have your luggage arrive when you do\n\nJFK that afternoon was a zoo like I had never seen.\n\nWith no suitcase and little help at the lost-baggage counter, I stood in a long American line to try to get an earlier ticket to Des Moines.\n\nI took notice of the detached expressions on the agents' faces, while several people fidgeting around me groused that they were missing international flights, even though they had showed up hours in advance.\n\nAnd this was the American ticket line. Not security.\n\nThis past week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey publicly criticized the Transportation Security Administration for long security wait times at JFK, saying they surged by 82 percent this spring compared with a year ago.\n\nThe TSA blamed the longer lines, in part, on tighter security measures imposed after an investigation last year revealed serious flaws in airport security. Some policy analysts responded that the longer lines we're seeing this summer are making us more vulnerable to terrorist attacks inside airports.\n\nAmerican did grant me an earlier ticket home, but the connection from D.C. was too tight, so I missed a flight to Chicago. The minute I returned to Des Moines the next afternoon, I lodged an initial lost-bag complaint with American.\n\nI will spare you the agonizing waits and daily phone calls since.\n\nBut I will say I managed to clean my entire house one Sunday afternoon while on hold. Every time I call, is like \"Groundhog Day\" — only I get to explain the story of the missing suitcase to a different person. Among the many things I’ve been told by workers on American's 800 line is this priceless gem: “American’s lost baggage recovery unit is in complete command of the situation.”\n\nA week after the bag disappeared, I filled out all the necessary paperwork identifying what was in the bag and its approximate value, including some receipts, and sent it to American online and by snail mail.\n\nNot long after, one American employee trying to track the bag's whereabouts confessed that the airline may not have looked for the suitcase earlier because one suitcase under my name had been delayed and returned in New Orleans. Apparently, workers couldn't tell that the suitcase had been lost again on its way home from Greece.\n\nAfter that, baggage trackers kept insisting that the bag never left Greece.\n\nSo, I asked a kindly travel agent friend in my favorite Greek village to check. She made the hour-and-a-half drive to Heraklion to see if the bag left the country. Vueling told her it had been sent to Rome.\n\nImagine my elation when, on Thursday, July 14, I got a call saying the black check-in had been located in Rome. The woman from American said it would be coming on a flight that Friday from Chicago, arriving at 6:30 p.m.\n\nI happily announced to friends on Facebook, joking that I hoped my clothes weren’t marinating in the four canisters of Greek olive oil I bought in Greece.\n\nSilly me. The suitcase never showed.\n\nOn Saturday morning, July 16, I called American again and learned that the Chicago flight had been delayed and it was unclear whether my suitcase made the flight. So I went to the Des Moines airport. An American worker there knew nothing, but she promised that she would call me by the end of the day with an update. She didn’t.\n\nOn Sunday, someone named Irene from American with a Phoenix-area phone number called and told me that tracking suggested that the bag may have accidentally been sent to LAX in Los Angeles.\n\nThen she called back and left a message saying she believed that the bag was sent to Des Moines.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, after another hour on hold, someone in the baggage-recovery unit said the bag’s number was last tracked to Washington, D.C.\n\nDid I mention my legal name — Lisa Sutherland (Lee is a nickname, and Rood is my maiden name) — and phone number are on a plastic tag attached to this bag?\n\nThere’s got to be a better way\n\nThis past week, I sent a formal complaint to American trying to understand how an airline could lose a suitcase inside the U.S. that had already been found abroad.\n\nI know by law I am entitled to up to $3,500 for a bag lost inside the country, and I know the bag and its contents — full of many new vacation and work clothes, prescription glasses, shoes and jewelry — is worth at least that.\n\nBut I don’t want that.\n\nI want my suitcase back.\n\nAnd, being a watchdog for a living, I want some accountability.\n\nI want to understand the wayward path my suitcase really traveled and why it landed where it did.\n\nI fully realize this is a first-world problem, and I don't stress the small stuff. But American and other airlines have long been under fire to do better.\n\nAnd exasperating experiences like mine, coupled with the threat of terrorism now at home and abroad, are the ultimate travel buzz kill. Which is good for absolutely no one.\n\nI will say, all of the different people I've talked to at American have been very nice.\n\nOn Wednesday, one woman in the baggage-recovery unit in Phoenix promised to send messages to D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles and Des Moines another time in an attempt to locate the bag. I leaned on her hard because, get this: I am taking another international trip Tuesday. (What can I say? I got a nice tax refund this year.) She told me to go ahead and buy whatever I didn't have for the trip and the airline would reimburse.\n\nWhen I get my suitcase back, or receive my bad news from American, I will write an update, including some interesting suggestions from others on how this might be prevented.\n\nUSA TODAY: Seven things you need to do if the airline loses your luggage\n\nIn the meantime, there appears to be a ray of good news on this front:\n\nThis summer, the U.S. House and Senate managed to get something done on this problem before summer recess. Congress passed an agreement to improve airport security, reduce screening lines and require airlines to refund fees to passengers whose bags are lost or delayed.\n\nAmong other things, the measure authorizes a pilot program to develop and test more efficient passenger- and luggage-screening systems.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is expected to sign the measure.

But, hey, fishing was great", "text": "Art Holden\n\nOutdoor Correspondent\n\nI should have known from the very first sign.\n\nMy son, Izzy, and I recently met in Winnipeg, Manitoba for a fly-in fishing trip, and everything about it was sensational. The trip, home, though, was something else, and I refuse to let it diminish the fishing experience. It is, though, another chapter, and one that – like the fishing – will live long in my memory.\n\nIt started out nice enough, with a circle of Bolton Lake as we left in the bush plane and then a nice ride 300 miles back to the Winnipeg Airport. There, Izzy and I made it through security, and made a good choice to eat a salad bowl for lunch after four straight days of deep-fried walleye and potatoes.\n\nWe soon parted ways, with my Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving an hour before his West Jet trip to Calgary, and eventually back to Los Angeles.\n\nFirst clues to 30-hour ordeal are runway back, flying suitcases\n\nIt’s when my flight landed in Toronto the trip started turning sour. Toronto’s Pearson International Airport is a major hub for not only flights throughout Canada, but for a lot of international flights, and it’s one busy airport. As we landed, I could see out the plane’s window that things were backed up on the runway, and even worse on the tarmac. As we made our way to the terminal, the captain came over the loudspeaker, saying there was a delay and we would have to wait for an open gate.\n\nAs I looked out the window, it looked like a plane parking lot, with Air Canada jets everywhere. And then, the first real clue as to what was in store for me for the next 30 hours happened. In taking in the hustle and bustle of the tarmac, I watched as an employee was driving a series of baggage carts across the lot, when two suitcases went flying off one of the carts. The driver never stopped, and neither did any of the many other vehicles that sped past the luggage on the tarmac. I could only wonder what was happening to my suitcase.\n\nWe eventually found an open gate, and when I deplaned and made my way up the runway and into the terminal, the first thing I did was to check the board of incoming and outgoing flights, only to see the word “canceled” by my next flight to Cleveland. It was pretty clear, but just to make sure, I walked farther down the terminal to another board, and it too said my flight to Cleveland, on a perfectly calm, sunny Sunday, was indeed canceled.\n\nNow I was pretty familiar with the Air Canada section of the Toronto Airport as I had a seven-hour layover there on my trip out to Winnipeg. I didn’t plan it that way, but twice the airlines changed my flight from Toronto to Winnipeg, probably because I was flying economy, because they didn’t eliminate the earlier flights, just my seats on them.\n\nHoney, don't wait supper; I'm going to be late ... by a day or two\n\nAnyways, I knew where to go to check about my canceled flight, but first I had to email my wife so she wouldn’t leave to pick me up at the Cleveland airport. I didn’t pay for international calling for my trip, thinking an occasional text (which I paid a separate charge for each one) and free emails was the best way to go.\n\nLuckily, I got ahold of her, and let her know I was working on a solution.\n\nI found my way to the help desk a little before a host of other unhappy fliers did (including an entire Boy Scout troop from Virginia that had been canoeing in Canada), but got a lady behind a plexiglass window that A: I could barely hear, and B: I could barely understand; to help me with my problem.\n\nLike a lot of travelers, I found out my flight to Cleveland had been canceled due to a lack of pilots, and Air Canada had no other options of getting me to Cleveland the rest of the day. In fact, Air Canada’s best option was a 4:30 p.m. flight the next day …. to Chicago, and then to Cleveland.\n\nNow it didn’t make sense to me to fly west to Chicago for essentially a quick one-hour flight south to Cleveland, but that, their computer said, was my only choice.\n\nOnly supplies were a sock full of fishing reels and an airplane pillow\n\nI told the lady “you better get me a hotel,” and after clearing it with a supervisor, they printed me out a voucher for a room at the Airport Marriott, and gave me two $10 food vouchers to use at any restaurant in the airport.\n\nWhile that sounds good, that’s actually just $10 Canadian, which will buy you about half a sandwich at the airport. I had some snacks in my backpack, so I decided to save my vouchers for the next day, and headed out of the airport in search of a shuttle to the hotel.\n\nI managed to find my way to the shuttle pickup, and when I flashed my voucher to the person working the front desk at the Marriott, he assured me that I was in the right place and that the entire bill would be on Air Canada’s tab.\n\nNow, my only problem was I had a nice hotel room on the ninth floor of a nice, fancy hotel in Toronto, but I had no suitcase, no change of clothes, no toiletries. I had six fishing reels wrapped in white tube socks, an old shirt, snacks, paperwork, my passport and an airplane pillow in my backpack – that's it.\n\nI spent the next 18 hours showering, sleeping and watching ESPN bored out of my gourd, waiting for when I could head back to the airport.\n\nEven getting back to the airport had it moments\n\nI checked out at 11:30 a.m. and spent nearly an hour outside on the bench watching how the other half of the world lives. I gave up my seat on the noon shuttle to a family in a rush, and caught the next one to the airport, where I had to go through security and customs before I could find my way to my gate.\n\nIn line, I was between an Australian headed to Austin, Texas, for a convention, and a man returning home to Huntsville, Alabama. He was wearing a Duck’s Unlimited hat, so I struck up a conversation with him. He told me he was in Canada for a trapshooting competition. Having shot in championships in all 50 states, he was now working his way through shoots in Canada, having just competed in the Quebec championships.\n\nUnfortunately, there was a snafu with his gun in security, and now he was fearing he wouldn’t make it through customs in time to catch his flight to Nashville. The line was long, and only three agents were working for passengers headed to the United States.\n\nEventually, we both made it through, and he did make his flight, although they were boarding when he got there. I was scheduled from the same gate two hours later. With time to burn, I checked out my food options, and went with a chicken sandwich from Wahlburgers, but I still had to pay for a drink and a tip out of my own pocket.\n\nI little late, a few glares, but he makes the flight home\n\nNow, all I had to do was wait for my flight to Chicago and then on to Cleveland.\n\nBut, my flight to Chicago was delayed, and then we sat on the runway waiting in line to take off. That left me very little time in Chicago to catch my flight to Cleveland. I needed to change terminals, and in a slight jog, I started making my way from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1, knowing all the time my flight to Cleveland was about to take off.\n\nBack in the U.S., I could use my phone so I called my wife, who could see online my flight was in fact boarding. Hustling down hallways and walking escalators, I made my way to Terminal 1. I could see my Gate 22 in the distance, but I couldn’t pass up a chance to stop in the men’s room first. There were no passengers in the Gate 22 lobby when I finally got there, just a ticket agent, who patiently waited as I rifled through my backpack for my boarding pass.\n\nI’m usually not that person who is last on the plane, but sometimes, you just can’t help it. In fact, you can tell when you’re just making it in under the wire when the stewardess is addressing the passengers over the loudspeakers and you are asked to wait outside the plane as to not interrupt her.\n\nNow, a quick flight to Cleveland, pick up my bag, and an hour’s car ride and I’ll be home. Not so fast, though.\n\nBig surprise: Luggage lost\n\nOf course, my suitcase never arrived in Cleveland. Why would it?\n\nSo now, while my wife is in the airport’s cell phone lot awaiting my call, I’m filling out paperwork about my lost luggage.\n\n“Is there anything in your bag that if we opened it, we would know it’s yours?” asked the agent.\n\n“Yes,” I said, “there’s about 100 fishing lures in there and six spools of fishing line.”\n\n“Well,” the agent said, “it usually takes about two-seven days to find luggage. We’ll let you know.”\n\nTwo days later at 3:50 in the morning, I could hear my suitcase wheels rolling across my porch flooring. Everything made it back safe and sound.\n\nThat’s not the end of the story, though.\n\nAnd, another surprise: COVID strikes\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning at the Toronto Marriott, I had a scratchy throat, but I attributed that to sleeping in the air conditioning after four days of living in God’s country in the deep woods of Manitoba.\n\nThe next morning, though, I started to get a runny nose along with a sore throat, and two days later, I tested positive for COVID. Now seven days later, I still haven’t tested negative, even though I now feel fine and only ever had mild symptoms (morning fevers, achy). The real problem now is my wife is in the midst of COVID.\n\nSo, despite always wearing an N95 mask in the airports and planes, somewhere along the line I picked up the bug, and now my wife has it.\n\nMy trip home from Winnipeg was a nightmare, but it still doesn’t put a damper on my fishing trip of a lifetime with my son to Bolton Lake Lodge. It just added to the story.\n\nOutdoor correspondent Art Holden can be reached at letsplabal@yahoo.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2019/01/07/airlines-damage-checked-baggage-passenger-rights/2237648002/", "title": "Airline damage your bag? Here are your rights", "text": "The bright orange Kenneth Cole suitcase circled the baggage claim carousel at Dallas Love Field with what looked like an antenna.\n\nA piece of wire was all that remained of the retractable handle on the hardside bag.\n\nI pushed it into the Southwest Airlines baggage claim office to file a claim, short on time and unsure of what came next. It was the first time an airline damaged my bag. Delayed bags, I knew the drill. Lost bags, too, as an airline permanently lost a bag of mine several years ago.\n\nHere's what I learned: Travelers have options when it comes to damaged bags, and knowing your rights will put you in a better position to resolve the claim.\n\nIf you have a claim, that is. An airline's definition of damage, backed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, may differ significantly from a passenger's definition. Normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.\n\nEvery airline damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. And it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking a designer bag.\n\n\"If you have a Louis Vuitton (bag) and it goes through the (conveyor) belt system, it is not white glove service,'' said Lisa Ouimette, an analyst in American Airlines' central baggage services office. \"These are belt loaders. If you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.''\n\nAirlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zippers, as well as poor quality bags and bags that were damaged when checked in.\n\nSo what is covered?\n\nDamage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. The latter is a big problem in cold weather, Ouimette said. (So are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)\n\n\"We anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,'' she said.\n\nPassenger rights if an airline damages your bag\n\nMore than 87 percent of U.S. travelers don't file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by AirHelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. The three main reasons: They didn't think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights and they did not know how to file a claim.\n\nAirlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline’s control, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection division.\n\nThe cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. Many use Dallas-based Rynn's Luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.\n\nIf a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a like bag or passengers will be reimbursed. The reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the DOT says, subject to liability limits.\n\nFor flights within the United States, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is $3,500. The limit on international flights, per the Montreal Convention, is about $1,600, the agency says.\n\nAirlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the DOT.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're going to get $3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (The higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)\n\nMy suitcase wasn't new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. I worried that Delta Air Lines, which I was flying the next day out of Dallas, wouldn't accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.\n\nSouthwest baggage representatives in Dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn't doubt I needed a new bag. But they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (I never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)\n\nThey asked how old my bag was, where I purchased it and how much I paid for it. They took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. They couldn't find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. I didn't recall how much my bag was or where I purchased it but estimated it at between $150 and $200. A repair never came up.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. One was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. The hardside bag wouldn't fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so I initially passed.\n\nAmerican's Ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. She ordered a bunch for American for the busy holiday season. Many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.\n\nI was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me if I bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of Dallas the next morning. I didn't have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.\n\nIn the middle of the baggage claim office, I unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.\n\nI wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport's Uber pick-up area. I didn't make it. The wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.\n\nI fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn't work. They were apologetic, again. I repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag I bought, never setting a price limit. I didn't buy one in Dallas; a generous friend I was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.\n\nJust before Christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, I bought a bag I'd had my eye on, a $245 Away carry-on bag . It was nowhere near as big as the Kenneth Cole one Southwest broke, but my friend's bag took care of my big-bag needs and I was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.\n\nMy claim was finally resolved the day after Christmas in Phoenix. I landed at Sky Harbor International Airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from Providence.\n\nI submitted my receipt for $260, which included taxes. It took the agents time to find my claim because I didn't have my \"damage incident report'' and they were having computer issues.\n\nA supervisor offered $200, a figure noted in my report by the Dallas agents. I told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.\n\n\"We'll split the difference, how's that?'' she asked.\n\nAt 1 a.m., I walked out of the office with a check for $225.\n\n5 things to do if an airline damages your bag\n\n1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.\n\n2. Don't rip off your baggage tags. The airline will need them.\n\n3. Be calm and courteous. A banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn't going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.\n\n4. Know the approximate value of your bag and where you purchased it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.\n\n5. Jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it's not resolved immediately. Airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. Not getting the answers you want? Ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline's central baggage services office.\n\nMajor airline policies on damaged bags:\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nMore:Travel nightmares: What to do if you miss your flight", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2015/07/02/tsa-baggage-claim-damage-airports/29612639/", "title": "TSA pays millions for bag claims; $50K at Detroit Metro", "text": "By Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY, and Russ Ptacek, WUSA-9\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration paid passengers $3 million over the last five years -- including $50,886 to travelers who flew through Detroit Metropolitan Airport -- for claims that airport security screeners broke, lost or stole their luggage or items inside, according to a review of about 50,000 complaints.\n\nAfter investigating to determine whether TSA or its agents were responsible, the agency approved or settled with passengers in about 15,000 cases – nearly 1 out of 3 claims filed from 2010 to 2014. Payments ranged from a few bucks for missing food or medicine to several thousand dollars for jewelry, electronics and other items passengers said were broken or disappeared in TSA's hands.\n\nThe nation's 30 busiest airports accounted for about two-thirds of all paid claims and about the same share of the government settlement payments.\n\nWhile John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list with 857 paid claims and Los Angeles International was next at 791, that's largely a result of the many millions more passengers' TSA screens there.\n\nAmong the 30 top airports, once adjusted by the number of people served, the share of passengers who filed claims -- and got paid -- was highest at Dulles International in Washington and Orlando International in the 2010 to 2014 time frame. Smaller airports were not immune to the problem.\n\nBy comparison, there were 459 claims filed at Detroit Metro with 95 being approved or settled.\n\nAt Reno/Tahoe International, TSA approved 120 passengers' claims over five years -- about the same as much larger airports including Chicago Midway, Nashville and Detroit. Angeles International was next at 791, that's largely a result of the many millions more passengers' TSA screens there.\n\nTSA said the approved claims represent a tiny fraction of the 2.5 million pieces of baggage its agents screen every day. TSA only has access to fliers' property for a small share of its journey, and checked bags spend much more time winding through airport conveyor belts, riding carts to airplanes and being handled by airline employees.\n\nThe agency says it's taken a zero-tolerance approach to theft, tightened hiring requirements for screeners and stemmed the tide of claims. TSA supervisors have fired more than 500 officers since 2003 for theft. Claims filed, and claims paid, are down about 35% from 2010 to 2014, according to USA TODAY's analysis. TSA denied approximately half of all claims filed since 2010.\n\n\"TSA aggressively investigates all allegations of misconduct and, when infractions are discovered, moves swiftly to hold the offenders accountable,\" said Bruce Anderson, a TSA spokesman. \"TSA holds its security officers to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero-tolerance policy for theft in the workplace.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., said the overall $3 million paid to settle claims is cause for further investigation.\n\n\"Congress has been having problems getting straight answers about abuses at the TSA,\" Mica said. \"Orlando, my major home airport in Florida… has startling statistics. It warrants further review, even a subpoena for the information if that's what it takes.\"\n\nTSA officials say the agency pumped up efforts in recent years to train staff and monitor theft with undercover operations. About 1 of every 20 bags is opened by TSA staff, typically when scanning equipment flags something suspicious and screeners want to take a closer look.\n\nAirports are adding video monitoring to keep watch over those bag inspections. When investigating claims, TSA officials say more often than not, there is no evidence an item was damaged or went missing during screening. Half of the claims are denied nationwide.\n\nA 2011 report by the GAO found TSA workers received incomplete and inadequate background checks that sometimes missed disqualifying criminal information. In June, the government accountability investigators reported TSA has started to properly vet applicants.\n\nCharles Leocha, chairman of the advocacy group TravelersUnited.org, recommends against flying valuables in checked bags and suggests reporting luggage issues immediately.\n\n\"If there is a problem, you want to make sure you report it immediately to the authorities because airlines and airports all look at questions of missing items with a bit of skepticism when they're not reported for about 24 hours or so,\" Leocha said. \"They could've been lost anywhere.\"\n\nIf you notice damage or theft, and suspect a TSA officer was responsible, the agency provides a form online. Claimants must provide proof of the damage, the cost and TSA's negligence.\n\nOne unsuccessful claimant was Cory Doctorow, a London writer who was traveling on business to Phoenix in April. He posted a photo of his mangled $800 aluminum suitcase on his blog.\n\nDoctorow alleges TSA agents pried off the unlocked \"TSA-safe\" locks on his luggage – locks that are supposed to be opened with a universal key available to screeners at all airports.\n\n\"I was sent an illiterate, unhelpful response from a do-not-reply email address,\" Doctorow said. \"It said that TSA assumed no responsibility for damage inflicted during searches.\"\n\nDoctorow filed other claims with insurers and the airline. TSA officials say the agency accepts claims for damage to locks, and they concede that agents sometimes break locks to inspect bags.\n\nPassengers often file claims with airlines or airports in addition to TSA if they're unsure of who is responsible for damaged or lost luggage.\n\nFormer Denver TSA officer Jon Dewey said front-line workers get an unfair reputation and airline handlers are more likely responsible.\n\n\"I believe (TSA workers) probably have less opportunities than an airline employee and I trust TSA far more with my luggage than any airline,\" Dewey said.\n\nThere are no directly comparable statistics for private airlines. TSA's claims are public record because they involve government workers and the settlements are paid with taxpayers' money.\n\nSince airlines began charging for checked bags in 2008, mishandled baggage by airlines declined. The industry average is about three lost, damaged, delayed or stolen bags per 1,000 passengers, according to an April report by the Department of Transportation. In 2007, airlines mishandled 18.9 bags per 1,000, according to industry group SITA.\n\nVirgin American has the fewest lost bags per passenger and American Airlines subsidiary Envoy Air is ranked lowest with a rate more than double the national average.\n\n\"We're hiring additional ramp employees and investing in better baggage tracing technology for Envoy,\" said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/05/30/colorado-missing-toddler-jaryd-atadero-poudre-canyon-mountain-lion-disappearance-mystery/3708176002/", "title": "Jaryd Atadero, missing toddler from Poudre Canyon, a haunting story", "text": "Allyn Atadero emerged from the closet of a basement bedroom decked out in a Poudre River Resort theme, a nod to the place he once owned that now harbors happiness and immense heartache.\n\nTears welled up as he pulled a toy tank, Oakland Raiders hat, Star Wars toy and the top of his son's skull from a white cardboard box.\n\n\"I know it seems weird and some people might not understand, but this is all I have of him,'' said Allyn, now 61, as he pulled the skull fragment from a clear plastic bag. \"It’s sad, kind of surreal to think that this is my son.''\n\nTwenty years ago, Allyn Atadero experienced a parent's worst fear when his 3-year-old son, Jaryd, went missing while hiking with a group on the Big South Trail in the Roosevelt National Forest, 60 miles west of Fort Collins.\n\nThe perplexing events surrounding Jaryd's Oct. 2, 1999, disappearance set off one of the largest search-and-rescue missions in Larimer County history. The case garnered national and international headlines that created a cult-like following of a mystery that has haunted Allyn for much of the past 20 years.\n\nAdding to the case’s intrigue was the crash of a search helicopter, disappearance theories ranging from a mountain lion attack to abduction to drowning in the Big South River — each with its own holes — and a slew of reported sightings of Jaryd from around the country.\n\nThen, on June 4, 2003, two hikers from Fort Collins stumbled upon what 200-plus trained searchers, a water dive team, a dozen dog teams, professional trackers and a search plane couldn’t — Jaryd Atadero, or what remained of him.\n\nThis is the story of one of Colorado’s most infamous unsolved mysteries. It’s an emotional story with waves of heartache, frustration and false hope felt by family, law enforcement and search and rescue staff. It’s a story of a grieving father who, 20 years later, is filled with forgiveness and a tepid peace.\n\n\"I tell people Jaryd is kind of like having a pebble in your shoe,'' Allyn said during an interview at his home in Parker earlier this May. “You know it’s there; every time you take a step you feel it. You can’t do anything about it, but it’s not enough to stop you from doing what you need to do every day. That’s Jaryd.\n\n\"He’s my little pebble.''\n\n‘They lost my baby, they lost my baby’\n\nSaturday, Oct. 2, 1999, was one of those gorgeous fall bluebird days in the mountains of Colorado, and Allyn Atadero and his children, Jaryd and 6-year-old Josallyn, were in the heart of the beauty at the Poudre River Resort owned by Allyn and his twin brother, Arlyn.\n\nThe kids were anxious to go on an excursion to the nearby state fish hatchery with members of the Christian Singles Network group, of which Allyn, who was divorced from the children's mother, was a member.\n\nAllyn was reluctant for Jaryd to go, but when the group said they would only be going to the hatchery, he consented. But from there, the 11 members of the Christian group plus Josallyn and Jaryd decided to take an early afternoon hike up the Big South Trail, 15 miles west of the resort.\n\nThough reports vary on what happened next, it is generally believed the group split into faster- and slower-paced groups on the 11-mile trail, located at 8,440 feet in the rugged Comanche Peak Wilderness and that eventually crosses into Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nAbout 1.5 miles up the trail, Jaryd ran ahead of the group he was with and talked to two fishermen, who didn’t think much about Jaryd being alone since they told investigators they saw a group about 50 to 80 feet down the trail, according to a Larimer County Search and Rescue report. The last the fishermen saw of Jaryd, he was walking rapidly up the trail adjacent to the \"Camp 2\" sign, indicating the second of 16 backcountry campsites along the trail.\n\nIt is unclear if Jaryd was between the two groups or ahead of the faster group when he met the fishermen, who are believed to be the last to see Jaryd before he disappeared.\n\nSome members of the 11-person hiking party reported hearing a scream, according to the investigation report. Josallyn told Allyn she did, too.\n\n\"I asked her, 'What kind of scream was it?'; like somebody getting attacked or somebody playing with someone,\" he said. \"She said it sounded like a playful scream, like someone was going up to tag him.\"\n\nAfter realizing Jaryd was missing and searching for him for about an hour, two members of the group returned to the resort to tell Allyn.\n\n\"They said, 'you need to sit down, something happened to Jaryd,'\" Allyn recalled. \"I asked them, 'What happened to Jaryd?' — thinking he fell down and got hurt. They said, 'He’s OK, we just can’t find him.' ''\n\nAllyn jumped in his vehicle and drove to the trailhead, screaming, \"They lost my baby, they lost my baby,\" and \"beating my chest all the way up there.\"\n\nHe ran up the trail but quickly discovered he wasn’t going to find Jaryd by himself. By the time Allyn returned to the trailhead to have his resort manager call the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office, the manager already had.\n\nA sheriff's deputy and a Larimer County Search and Rescue member arrived, followed by more of each.\n\nJosallyn, who is now married and lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said she doesn’t have many vivid memories of the events but does remember her father returning from the trail without Jaryd.\n\n\"One of those memories was at the resort and hugging my dad, who was kneeling or squatting and crying and then wrapping my arms around him because I realized how serious this was,'' she said.\n\nBill Nelson, now a recently retired undersheriff with the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office, was in charge of the search for Jaryd. When searchers arrived, it appeared to be just another mission, he said in a recent interview.\n\n\"Absolutely, I thought we would find him,''’ he said. \"Yes, it was a young child, but my thought was we should be able to get in there with our people and do what we do and what we have done hundreds of times: find the person. It might take a few hours to find the child crying or hiding someplace nearby, but we would be done before midnight.''\n\nNelson said he went to his vehicle to nap just before midnight and told his staff to wake him when they found the boy. When he awoke the next morning in the front seat of his pickup, he became concerned.\n\nThe search for Jaryd hadn't gone as planned. Nor would it.\n\nHelicopter down\n\nSunday morning, Allyn and Josallyn heard the \"whop, whop, whop'' of a search helicopter making its way up the canyon.\n\n\"I remember saying to Josallyn, 'Look, there’s the helicopter, they are going to find your brother,' and we watched it fly over us,'' Allyn said.\n\nInstead of searching for Jaryd on that flight, the Huey UH-1N helicopter from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo., flew to what was then the Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport to refuel.\n\nWhen the helicopter returned, it struggled with the fuel load and mountain conditions and stalled out, falling 100 feet and crashing up the Big South Trail. Aboard were four members of the Air Force and Mark Sheets, a Loveland resident and Larimer County Search and Rescue member.\n\nSheets wasn’t supposed to be on the flight but had relieved his manager, George Janson, from his shift. Janson suggested Sheets fly with the crew to help the team make ground search plans.\n\nSheets, 57, who retired from Larimer County Search and Rescue in 2017 after 30 years, remembers the moment before impact.\n\n\"I said on the intercom that we needed altitude now and (remember) the co-pilot saying, 'I know but I can’t. We are going in,'\" he said. \"To me that was code for brace for impact.\"\n\nSheets was the only crew member not in a seat — he was on the floor with the door open. He saw the rotors hit the tops of trees and pieces of helicopter spray into the forest. He tried to shut the door, but a severed tree limb came through and struck the Air Force doctor on board, fracturing the doctor's eye socket.\n\nSheets said the helicopter continued to disintegrate — the fuselage split into three pieces — as it crashed across the trail. The jet engines, still operational, would roar for hours until the fuel ran out.\n\nThe Air Force crew was able to get out of the helicopter, Sheets said, but he was trapped. Nearby search and rescue members ran to the downed helicopter, kicked in a window and managed to pull the unconscious Sheets out.\n\nSheets, who skipped wearing a helmet so he could wear a headset to communicate with the pilot, suffered a severe concussion and a 13-inch, L-shaped gash that left his femur exposed. He also suffered three broken vertebrae in his lower back and a broken shoulder, he presumes from being pulled from the wreckage.\n\nHe spent three days at Poudre Valley Hospital, where he impatiently waited for word about the search for Jaryd.\n\n\"That made me angry because I wanted to be out there doing something useful,'' he said.\n\nCurrent Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith was a sergeant with the department during the search, for which he was the public information officer. He said the crash added to the stress of a search that only grew more frustrating as the national media took notice.\n\nTV trucks and newspaper reporters began to swarm the remote site after the grand jury in another chilling child case — the death of JonBenet Ramsay in Boulder — postponed its announcement of whether it would hand down indictments.\n\nThe perfect storm was brewing.\n\n\"I remember from moment one that second day, we quickly realized what we were up against,'' Smith said. \"We had searchers down who they were bringing out on stretchers, we had a missing kid overnight, we had the Air Force closing off the crash site. Emotionally it was overwhelming, and you could see it in the eyes of everybody involved.\"\n\nTV satellite trucks — 17 at one time — lined up along Colorado Highway 14 with \"anchors in fur coats walking around and anybody and everybody calling us for information,'' Smith said.\n\nThe disappearance of Jaryd Atadero had become an international spectacle.\n\n‘Daddy, if he's not alive, God has him’\n\nAs the search stretched into the third day, searchers combed river banks and up steep slopes. Dive teams peered into small pools left in the narrow, slow-moving river. A plane made passes overhead.\n\nWith every intense hour that searchers came up empty, the crush of questions squeezed law enforcement and searchers even harder.\n\nWell-meaning but ill-equipped people were increasingly hounding the Larimer County Sheriff's Office and Larimer County Search and Rescue to allow them to help.\n\nPsychics professed to know where searchers could find Jaryd. A bare-footed man with a mule showed up at the search site, ready to track him down. An American Indian came to perform a ritual, asking the mountain to give up the boy.\n\nTheories as to what happened to Jaryd were expanding from rational possibilities — killed by a predator, fell behind boulders and died, drowned in the river — to the less plausible, but still possible, theory of abduction, to strange conspiracy theories.\n\nA variety of people were voicing those theories to a vulnerable Allyn and his family, creating growing tension between the family and searchers.\n\n\"It became a tornado, hurricane, biggest storm in all of our lives,'' Allyn said. \"I was critical of them at the time because when you are in a survival situation, you want everything that can be done to be done, and at times I thought there was so much more they could have done.''\n\nNelson said things became so tense between the family and searchers that he had to take Allyn and his family for a hike up the trail to hash things out.\n\n\"Allyn and his family were certain that Jaryd had been abducted because we couldn’t find him,\" Nelson said. \"I might have felt the same way if it was my son, but we knew abduction was slim.''\n\nIt was the theory that, despite long odds, was gaining traction.\n\nBut who could have abducted Jaryd?\n\nInvestigators questioned everyone from Allyn to members of the Christian singles group to the fishermen who were presumably the last to see Jaryd. They talked to Allyn’s ex-wife, who was living in San Diego and came to Colorado after hearing Jaryd was lost.\n\nNo red flags.\n\n\"There were people who wanted to point to the abduction conspiracy theory but nothing ever fell in line with it,'' Smith said. \"How could you capture this kid in the woods in this short time frame and then have gotten out without anybody seeing you? It just wasn’t probable.''\n\nThere is only one easy way out of the narrow canyon — back down the trail. On the day of Jaryd's disappearance, one of the first searchers quickly hiked up to where snow covered the trail and saw no tracks. Hiking out either side of the narrow canyon would require a climb of 1,000 to nearly 2,000 vertical feet through thick trees and downed logs on a 45-degree slope.\n\nAs the search continued with no signs of Jaryd, the mountain lion attack theory became officials' prevailing thought. There were mountain lion prints found in the area but nothing conclusive to indicate Jaryd might have been killed along the trail.\n\nBut an 18-year-old man was killed by a mountain lion near Idaho Springs in 1991, and a 10-year-old boy was killed by a lion in 1997 in nearby Rocky Mountain National Park. Wildlife experts said it wouldn’t take much for a mountain lion to carry a 3-year-old boy off the trail.\n\nWith Jaryd's trail growing colder, the sheriff's office met with Allyn and his family and made the difficult decision to call off the official search after a week. Others were allowed to continue the search on their own.\n\n\"I remember that Saturday after they called off the search going to Jaryd’s closet and putting away his dirty clothes and picking up the tank and toy soldiers from the bathtub where, the day before he went missing, he took a bath,'' Allyn said. \"I realized then I would never see him again. I had his toys but I didn't have my baby.''\n\nGone was Allyn falling asleep nightly with Jaryd holding his hand. Gone was the weekly ritual where Allyn, Josallyn and Jared would stand together holding hands, raising them up as Allyn declared, \"This is who you can count on for the rest of your life.''\n\nGuilt, loneliness and frustration ate at Allyn in the apartment the three shared in Littleton, where Allyn was teaching. Josallyn came to the rescue.\n\n\"Looking back, Josallyn was always there for me, but I wasn’t always there for her,'' Allyn said. \"She was always putting her arms around me after Jaryd was gone. One day she asked me if Jaryd was bothering me and I said, 'Yes.'\n\n\"Her response was, 'Daddy there are only two things that could happen to Jaryd: Somebody has him and he is alive. If he’s not alive, God has him, so why are you worried?'\"\n\nMiracle on the mountain\n\nWhile the search for Jaryd faded, hoaxes continued to haunt Allyn for years.\n\nA Fort Collins woman was charged for repeatedly and falsely claiming she knew a woman who abducted Jaryd. Reports of Jaryd being seen alive ranged from coast to coast. And earlier this May, a California man who for years has claimed to be Jaryd — though DNA tests have shown otherwise — was arrested in Douglas County near where Allyn lives for violating a restraining order against him.\n\n\"For many, many years, a door would open that would lead to another door that would lead to another door,'' said Deborah Atadero, Allyn’s wife of 16 years. \"It was just exhausting, hoping the next door is going to be the answer, the next person is going to help, that next we would find out exactly what happened to Jaryd.''\n\nAnd then they did. Or, at least, they found more breadcrumbs.\n\nOn June 4, 2003, Fort Collins businessmen and hiking partners Gary Watts and Rob Osborne were hiking off-trail in the Big South Trail area when they stumbled upon a white Tarzan tennis shoe in a talus slope 500 vertical feet above the trail.\n\nThen they found the other shoe, a brown fleece jacket and blue sweatpants turned inside out. One pant leg was mostly scattered by birds using the material in their nests.\n\nWatts and Osborne knew instantly who they had discovered.\n\n\"The thing is, we were up there a week earlier and talked quite a bit about the various scenarios about his disappearance,'' said Osborne, owner of Avogadro’s Number restaurant and bar in Fort Collins. \"Then we happened upon the clothes, and it’s mystery solved.\n\n\"Once we saw the clothes, I knew exactly what happened to him; a mountain lion killed him. We felt that finding the items would hopefully bring some closure to the family.''\n\nThey photographed the area and clothing as they found them, turned a bread bag inside out and took the fleece jacket and a shoe with them to the sheriff’s office the next day, as they didn’t return to Fort Collins until late that evening.\n\nThe next day, it took searchers about an hour to reach the site near Campsite 2, where they found the remaining clothing scattered across a 25-foot area. Some of the items were sheltered from the elements and some were exposed.\n\nWhile the cloth jacket had what appeared to be puncture marks and the pants were tattered, the nylon shoes had little weathering. Eleven days later — just before Father's Day — searchers found a molar and skull cap.\n\n\"One of our members was walking and about to step on a shrub when a member just below them saw the skull under the shrub,'' said Don Davis, a search and rescue member involved with the search. \"I remember Allyn being up there with us. He asked if he could hold his son’s skull, and it was a very sad situation.''\n\nInitial DNA tests found an 86% chance the remains were Jaryd, Allyn said. It wasn’t until a decade later that new DNA technology proved 100% they were Jaryd's remains.\n\n\"Once you hear that, all hope of him being alive or somewhere else all goes right out with that,\" Allyn said of the confirmation.\n\nAccording to Larimer County Search and Rescue's report, searchers on foot had never made it up to the 9,120 foot elevation at Jaryd's skull and tooth were found. The Air Force helicopter would have likely searched the area had it not crashed.\n\nAdditional tests by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, including for blood and hair on the clothing the hikers found, revealed little about what killed Jaryd. His death certificate indicates the manner of death as \"undetermined, probable mountain lion attack.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure we will ever know 100%, but at this point in my life I'm not sure it matters,'' Allyn said.\n\n‘Wish you were here’\n\nJaryd has been gone in body for 20 years, but not in spirit.\n\nAllyn, Deborah and family members celebrate Jaryd’s birthday — Jan. 2, 1996 — every year with a cake.\n\n\"We sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to him each year, and each year Allyn barely gets out the first two words when he starts crying,'' Deborah said. \"But we believe it’s important to honor him.''\n\nWhen Josallyn got married last summer, they had a seat for Jaryd at the reception, adorned with his beloved Raiders hat. A month before the wedding, Allyn hiked up to the spot where they found Jaryd's remains and left a wedding invitation for him.\n\nAnd then there is the Pink Floyd song, \"Wish You Were Here.\" It was Allyn's and Jaryd’s song, he said, and it plays on the radio just when he needs to be reminded of his son.\n\n\"On Oct. 2 of last year, I got into my car and was backing out of the driveway when our song came on the radio,'' Allyn said. \"That made me smile''\n\nAllyn, who retired Tuesday as a physical education teacher at Falcon Bluffs Middle School in Ken Caryl, said it’s those little reminders and a strong Christian faith that comfort him now.\n\n\"I know I will see him again one day,'' he said. \"When I do, I’m going to walk up to him and say, 'Jaryd, so tell me what happened.' And he’s going to look at me and say, 'Dad does it really matter?'\"\n\nArlyn, Allyn’s twin brother and a retired school administrator who lives in Fort Collins, said he has slowly seen his brother work through the dark times to a place not of closure, but contentment.\n\n\"For years, I looked at him and saw dead man walking,'' Arlyn said. \"People talk about the worst thing a parent can go through, and I had a front-row seat for it and it was a horrible thing to watch. But I definitely see him at peace now.''\n\nJosallyn said she, too, has noticed her father has healed, but she knows \"what could have been\" remains that pebble in both of their shoes.\n\n\"We will probably never know exactly what happened to Jaryd, but we are at some kind of peace with that,'' she said. \"Still, you think about all the things you missed out on in those 20 years, and it makes me miss him even more.''\n\nNelson and Smith said they have come as close to peace with the case as they can get. It’s not complete peace because of the outcome, but they feel they did all they could to find Jaryd alive. Both believe Jaryd was killed quickly by a mountain lion before they were even called.\n\n\"I have no drive to try and change somebody’s mind of what happened,'' Smith said. \"We are 95% or 99% sure what happened to Jaryd. What I do know is that I can go to a (Search and Rescue) meeting today and bring up Jaryd Atadero’s name and there will be tears. They all wanted a different outcome, and it is something these people will take to their graves.''\n\nAllyn and Deborah have rallied for a number of initiatives to help fund search and rescue teams since Jaryd's death. And those hard feelings during the search have faded to admiration for the difficult tasks of law enforcement and searchers.\n\n\"Back then we all started in different spots up there on that mountain,'' said Allyn, rubbing the top of Jaryd's skull. \"Today, it’s about where we finished. We can all start in different spots and still finish in the same spot. I need to give all those people a hug because they are God’s angels.\n\n\"I always tell people pain is a direct reflection of love. The more you love something, the more it’s going to hurt. My hurt was intense because my love for Jaryd was intense. But there comes a point when you look back and say the best part of the world is the peace that we have. There is nothing more important than having peace and joy in your life. And I finally feel that peace.''\n\nMore:Podpast: Family speaks about the disappearance of Chris Vigil\n\nTimeline: The disappearance of Jaryd Atadero\n\nThis timeline was compiled from Larimer County Search and Rescue's investigation report.\n\nOct 2, 1999\n\n10 a.m.: Three-year-old Jaryd Atadero, his 6-year-old sister, Josallyn Atadero, and 11 members of the Christian Singles Network leave the Poudre River Resort, owned by the children’s father, Allyn Atadero, for a hike on the Big South Trail, 15 miles west of the resort and 60 miles west of Fort Collins.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Two fishermen talk to Jaryd near the Camp 2 site and see hikers from a group 50 to 80 feet away. They return to fishing, believing Jaryd will soon be met by the group. They are the last known people to see Jaryd alive.\n\nApproximately 12:15 p.m.: The hiking group realizes Jaryd is missing and searches for him for about an hour. Some members return to the Poudre River Lodge to alert Allyn, who drives to the trail and searches for another hour.\n\n4 p.m.: Allyn returns to the lodge to call 911, which has already been called by his resort manager.\n\n4:26 p.m.: An emergency pager alert is sent to Larimer County Emergency Services Specialist Bill Nelson.\n\n5:07 p.m.: Page sent to Larimer County Search and Rescue manager George Janson. (Lag time here is standard procedure to allow mountain deputy to verify if a search is needed.)\n\n6:30 p.m.: Search personnel reach lower Big South Trailhead.\n\n8 p.m.: Searchers from the lower and upper trailhead meet between Campsites 7 and 8 without finding a sign of Jaryd. Search plans are expanded and more resources are ordered, including a helicopter planned to arrive at first light.\n\nOct. 3, 1999\n\n7 a.m.: Overnight search team members are told to be extremely vigilant at dawn as family members tell searchers Jaryd wakes at dawn. Dive team employed for Big South River.\n\n7 a.m.: Air Force helicopter from F.E. Warren Air Force base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, makes first flight then heads to Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport to refuel.\n\n3:30 p.m.: Helicopter crashes during low hovering search of area along upper Big South Trail. Four Air Force members and a Larimer County Search and Rescue member were aboard.\n\n6 p.m.: All five aboard are transported from the crash site, three via air ambulance and two via ground ambulance. All survive but two have significant injuries.\n\nOct. 4, 1999\n\nA Lama helicopter from GeoSeis Helicopters in Fort Collins joins searchers and encounters swirling winds that require full power to prevent crashing. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter returns to Fort Collins.\n\nOct. 5-7, 1999\n\nMore than 200 trained searchers, a dozen dog teams, professional trackers, a dive team and a plane search for Jaryd without finding any solid clues.\n\nOct. 8, 1999\n\n7 p.m.: The search for Jaryd is suspended due to lack of clues. Family is notified.\n\nJune 4, 2003\n\nLate afternoon: Fort Collins businessmen and avid hikers Gary Watts and Rob Osborne are hiking off trail about 500 vertical feet and 1,050 lateral feet on the east slope above near the Camp 2 marker along the Big South Trail when they come upon sneakers and clothing. They know instantly they have found Jaryd’s clothes. They were not looking for Jaryd but were on a hike of the area.\n\nJune 5, 2003\n\nWatts and Osborne take photos and some of the articles of clothing they found to the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office. Photos are emailed to Allyn Atadero in Littleton and he confirms the clothing and shoes are Jaryd's.\n\nJune 6, 2003\n\nLarimer County Sheriff’s Office staff hikes to the area where the clothing was found, retrieves the other articles and processes the scene.\n\nJune 14, 2003\n\n8:30 a.m.: Team of Larimer County Sheriff’s Office members, Larimer County Search and Rescue, Colorado Division of Wildlife and NecroSearch meet at Big South Trailhead to start search for remains of Jaryd. Later, Allyn Atadero and personnel from the local Child Protection Network join the group.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Searchers hike in approximately 1.5 miles and make the 500 vertical climb up to the site where hikers found the clothing.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Searchers find a skull fragment in a crevice and a tooth on a log spanning the crevice above the skull fragment. The positioning of the skull fragment is such that it is visible from only a narrow angle and is lit by a shaft of light from the sun. The site is about 180 feet north and about 20 feet higher in elevation than the clothing site.\n\n5 p.m.: Allyn, searchers and others meet with the media at the trailhead to announce what they have found.\n\nSource: Larimer County Search and Rescue report\n\nHiking with children\n\nFollow these safety tips when hiking with children:\n\nKeep children in your sight.\n\nDress them in brightly colored clothing with multiple layers to accommodate the changing temperatures.\n\nGive them a whistle in case they get lost.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 16, 2016\n\nEmbracing the zeal\n\nA friend made an offhanded joke about CrossFit members being a cult while we were hanging out a while back.\n\nI know he doesn’t read my paragraphs, so I decided to let him talk.\n\nHe complained about the fact that CrossFit athletes tend to talk about their accomplishments a lot and seem boastful about their fitness.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFinally, I told my friend that I went to CrossFit Merle Hay. The workouts have helped me lose more than 120 pounds, get stronger, more flexible and more mobile than I have been in years.\n\nMy friend shrugged and said I didn’t seem like a narcissist. I let the conversation thread die out.\n\nIt strikes me as ironic to be judged harshly for both being morbidly obese and for trying to fight it at a gym.\n\nI should say this for the record: I don’t endorse CrossFit. This is the gym and workout plan I chose, mostly because of my close friendship with CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho.\n\nI generally support any course of action that involves eating less and moving more, especially in a society as sedentary as ours, whether it be long walks or a regimented program of diet and exercise.\n\nCrossFit seems to have some kind of reputation as a place where people get hurt. I don’t understand this, in part because I went to CrossFit while I was hurting.\n\nMy knees hurt so bad it was hard to step off curbs or get in and out of cars. I could easily hurt my back carrying in groceries or getting out of bed.\n\nAt CrossFit, I’ve only gotten stronger, faster and leaner.\n\nAm I a picture of fitness? Absolutely not.\n\nThe things I see the elite athletes do at CrossFit boggle my mind. The feats seem truly superhuman.\n\nBut we all had different goals. My goal is losing weight and having the physical strength and endurance to live my life without limitations as long as possible.\n\nIt’s true that CrossFit athletes do talk about their activities. I spent a good five minutes talking to Nate about my technique on the rowing machine in a recent session.\n\nNate encouraged me to lean back farther, pull harder with my arms to get the most out of my strong legs. The first workout I tried his tips in resulted in much higher rotations per minute during my rows.\n\nA year ago, I never thought I would ever have a conversation with anyone about technique on a rowing machine.\n\nThat CrossFit athletes talk about what they do isn’t so unusual. How many times have you been stuck next to someone who is very into gardening, shopping of fantasy football?\n\nI don’t write these paragraphs to pick on my friend. He’s as good and loyal a man as I know.\n\nWhat I am emphasizing, however, is that we could all do a better job of being more tolerant of different ideas and different ways.\n\nThe truth is, I probably held much the same view of CrossFit as my buddy before I started it. I thought of CrossFit athletes as zealots.\n\nBut if this zealously is helping improve and extend my life. Count me all the way in.\n\nWEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 2016\n\nEmpathy is winning\n\n“Someone @DMRegister must think @newsmanone story is compelling but it’s getting old, repetitive & a waste of space. Not good writer either,” wrote a Twitter user who identifies as Susan Thorne and uses the handle @SueIowaGal.\n\nI don’t know this person, or at least I don’t think I do. But the tweet tweaked all the proper insecurities.\n\nMaking Weight is “getting old, repetitive & a waste of space.” Yeah, I’ve thought that, too. It worries me a great deal. Part of the reason the story is so slow moving is because weight loss and wellness are very incremental with successes and failures.\n\nOnly the gross fiction of game shows such as “The Biggest Loser” produce weight loss results in quick bursts.\n\nIn fact, a study of 14 contestants who participated in the 30-week competition regained most of their weight if not more and suffered slower metabolism, which means they were burning fewer calories than they were before they participated in the show.\n\nBut the audience, in this case, readers of this news organization, have come to believe the arc of carefully crafted fiction can be replicated in life. I assure you, it cannot. And that’s why my effort to lose more than 300 pounds began as a marathon rather than a sprint.\n\nStill, I worry that readers, who are easily distracted and often bored, will lose touch with the underlying themes of continuing to fight for wellness despite setbacks and the judgment of others who really don’t understand how hard it is making life-altering choices.\n\nSo that stung. It’s a criticism for which I have no answer other than this: This is non-fiction and I am a work in progress. I can’t and won’t alter course to make the story more entertaining. I’m working for wellness, not “likes” on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe second half — “not a good writer either” — hurt a little, too. It hurt because I am insecure. Most people are. Few of us talk about it. We bluster or hide. In these paragraphs, though, I am as stripped down and raw as I can be.\n\nThis is a difficult path because I am more vulnerable to the cruelties of social media hecklers.\n\nYes, criticism comes with this job. I understand that and even welcome it. But the tone of the internet is overwhelmingly angry. My friend Bill McClellan, a semi-retired columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, calls the trend “compulsive outrage disorder.”\n\nI am old enough to remember the beginning of the modern internet. When I was a student at Drake University in the early 1990s, we had something called a VAX system.\n\nIt had primitive email and text-only web searching. If you wanted to download a single photograph from the web, you needed some fairly sophisticated computer science skills to do it.\n\nBut even then there were bulletin board systems, the precursor to the chat rooms, which I suppose are an early ancestor of social media. And the bulletin board systems on that old VAX system where overwhelmingly angry.\n\nThe most popular posts were by people who said the meanest things about others on campus, particularly those in public services like the student government or campus newspaper editor.\n\nI’ve got a lot of experience dealing with mean things said about me by people I don’t know on the internet. And I am no better at it today than I was more than 25 years ago.\n\nI harbor great insecurity that I have my job not because I earned it through merit but simply because I survived through attrition after job cuts. My bosses tell me this isn’t true and this is a manifestation of my negative self-talk.\n\nMaybe they’re right. But there are plenty of former Register employees on Facebook who gleefully jump on any of my or my colleagues’ foibles to make withering remarks that I hope at least make them feel good about themselves.\n\nWhenever I write about these kinds of worries, someone drags out the cliché: “Just grow a thicker skin.”\n\nI reject this premise. That simply gives a permission to people who are being mean for the sake of being mean. I’m a sensitive person and sometimes things said of me hurt.\n\nI recognize, too, that I say things, either in an attempt at humor, through sarcasm or simply because of my perspective, that hurt other people’s feelings. I’m truly sorry when it does. That’s never the goal.\n\nJust the other day, I got into an argument with my boss over what was ultimately a trivial matter. I lost my temper in a fit of anxiety and said things I regretted. I later apologized. She accepted. We moved forward.\n\nI write about the effect of this tweet on me not to induce sympathy from readers. Rather, I note it because mental health is as critical to wellness as physical health.\n\nI’ve noted my struggles with anxiety and depression in these columns many times. Again, this isn’t a plea for sympathy but an earnest effort to broaden understanding and engage empathy.\n\nI’m just one person who is trying to lose weight, better control my mood disorders and generally get healthy. But, in a way, I represent roughly a million Iowans considered obese and about 750,000 Iowans who live with a mental health issue.\n\nI write about my struggles for all those people who don’t have the benefit of advocacy or representation in the media. And if that means I have to take hits on social media or the comment section, so be it.\n\nBut I think empathy may be winning.\n\nI finished my second full year as a columnist for The Register in November. Since I started the job, I’ve made it a practice of saving positive emails in a folder and counting them on or near my anniversary.\n\nReaders sent 1,309 positive emails over the last year. And thank you to every single person who took the time to sit down and write their kind thoughts, well wishes and other uplifting messages. It means a lot.\n\nAs for the Twitter critic, I responded with my usual form tweet:\n\n“Gosh, it’s nice to meet you, too. Where would you like your autographed photo sent?”\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 1, 2016\n\nThe long and short of it\n\nI’m learning that you need both a long and short memory when it comes to intense exercise.\n\nFor example, in a recent workout, my coach and friend, Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay, put me through a metabolic conditioning that involved a deadlift, shoulder press and burpees.\n\nThe plan was to decrease in reps by round, starting at 10 and ending with one. The workout was capped at 20 minutes. The added twist was three burpees every two minutes.\n\nThe first round went well. I attacked the 10 deadlifts and shoulder presses with relative ease. I hit the floor for burpees with as much grace as my 440-pound frame can manage.\n\nThe round of nine went OK, but I tired quickly.\n\nBy the round of seven, I was gasping for air, a little dizzy and needed to take a seat between reps. The 20 minutes expired and I stalled after the round of seven.\n\nNate encouraged me to get a drink and focus on lowering my heart rate with slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.\n\nI was annoyed that I didn’t do better. Nate told me we would retest on the workout in a couple months. He figured I would pass all 10 rounds by then.\n\nI lacked his confidence in me, but this is where the memory question comes in.\n\nIn the short-term, I need to forget that workout results. I did the best I could. I didn’t get as far as I wanted to, but I still worked out at a strong pace for 20 minutes. There will be more weights to lift, more burpees to, um, burp, and so on.\n\nThe point is to get in as many quality repetitions in as possible even if it falls short of the goal of the planned workout. Each rep builds muscle, burns fat and increases endurance.\n\nSure, I still wish I could rip through the workout at top speed right now.\n\n“If you did,” Nate said, “what would we have to strive for?”\n\nI smirked.\n\n“I’m sure you can find a way to make it harder,” I said.\n\nThis is where a long-view is necessary. It was not that long ago that I got winded walking to the mailbox and hesitated to step off curbs because my knees would hurt too much from the girth crashing down onto the fragile, arthritic joints.\n\nA week or so back, I realized I could lift my lower leg off the floor and catch the ankle with my hand to stretch out the quads. I haven’t been able to do that since high school. We’re talking more than 23 years ago.\n\nWhen I started at CrossFit with Nate, I had to awkwardly lift my leg onto a box and lean back to stretch that quad. Now I’m much more flexible and leaner than I was eight months ago.\n\nI still get disgusted with myself when I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror coming out of the shower or see pictures of my bulbous belly.\n\nBut I have to remember that in a relatively short period, I have come a long way. And it’s valuable to measure those gains.\n\nNo, I wasn’t able to finish the workout Nate laid out before me. That’s fine. I will make it one day. The victory is making enough progress to even safely attempt such an exertion.\n\nForget short-term foibles. Celebrate long-term accomplishments. And remember every rep counts.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 22, 2016\n\nScaling back\n\nThe holidays provide a difficult challenge for anyone trying to lose weight.\n\nLast year, still early in my efforts to recover from morbid obesity, I decided to forego a traditional Thanksgiving meal at my uncle’s house. My parents and I celebrated together quietly on another evening with a menu friendlier to my diet.\n\nI’m following the same plan this year, but with an added twist. I’ve decided not to check my weight until after the first of the year.\n\nThis is not giving myself permission to blow my daily calorie goals for the entirety of the holiday season. Rather, it’s been a stressful couple of months with public tragedies and personal struggles.\n\nWeighing in, even when I expect good results, is an anxiety-riddled experience. All of the health professionals in my life repeat the same mantra: Weight is not the only, nor the best measure of health.\n\nStill, I know that more than 440 pounds is not a health weight nor sustainable if I would like to live comfortably over the next few decades.\n\nSo when the scale creeps up, I am terribly disappointed in myself because it feels like I’m doing the same work twice rather than gaining ground.\n\nThe science of this thinking is poor. Weight fluctuates daily based on a myriad of factors, including water intake and the kinds of foods you recently ate.\n\nFor example, my weight numbers tend to be goofy if I step on the scale after having taken a protein shake or within two hours of an intense workout.\n\nFurther, every time I write about my weigh-ins, particularly those after which I’ve gained weight, the internet trolls really pounce.\n\nI would love to tell you that after two years of doing this job and nearly as long chronicling my health efforts, that I have found a good way to cope with the cruel things people say to me about this or any other topic.\n\nBut I haven’t.\n\nPeople say I need to get a thicker skin. The thickness of human skin is about a tenth of an inch. Mine is no different. I just don’t like to be insulted.\n\nWhy, then, would I actively seek a career that puts me before the public eye and requires me to comment on issues that are controversial? Well, that’s a long story, but at least one reason is that stacking paragraphs is what I’m best at and fear is only a powerful force in your life if you let it limit your possibilities.\n\nStill, I’ve been on edge for a long time. Now is not the time to test my maximum endurance, which, while it is quite high, has been pushed enough for one fall.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve probably gained a few pounds in the last few weeks. I do two things when I’m anxious: spend money and eat.\n\nI’ve dug out some bags of french fries from the back of the freezer. I stabbed more than a few tator tots with my fork. One or two Marie Callender’s frozen meals, heavy with fats and carbs, landed in my microwave.\n\nThese incidents would usually lead me to a lengthy series of self-loathing. But this is a long game and, frankly, I’m tired of hating myself. I wrote last week about how anxiety has twisted my brain for several weeks and for much of the fall.\n\nI’ll go back to the scale in January. I’m not afraid of it. I just don’t need to do things that add to acute stress right now. This is my choice to make and I’m comfortable with it.\n\nI’m still going to the gym and getting stronger, more flexible and agile working with my friend and trainer, Nate Yoho, of CrossFit Merle Hay. I enjoy these sessions very much and come to view them as much as mental health therapy as physical fitness.\n\nI plan to keep my workout schedule through the holidays. We’ll get back on the scale after the first of the year. For now, I want to focus on fellowship of friends and family, calming thoughts and activities and making the best food choices available during a challenging season.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016\n\nSetting it aside\n\nThe new day’s sunlight filtered through the vertical blinds in my living room when I finally realized I had been up all night.\n\nI looked at the bright red digits on the clock on my TV stand. The time was shortly after 7 a.m. on a Sunday.\n\nI was wide awake and had been for nearly 20 hours. Normally, this kind of insomnia is associated with the panic attacks symptomatic of my acute anxiety disorder.\n\nBut I did not feel anxious. I did not feel anything.\n\nI just kept flitting between small projects for no good reason.\n\nIt started with finishing a page in my “Doctor Who” adult coloring book, an activity specifically designed to be calming.\n\nUsually, that works. This time, though, I became hyper-focused on finishing the page before I went to bed.\n\nI remember going into the bedroom at about 2 a.m. That’s late for bedtime, but not terrible for a former night police reporter who enjoys the quiet solitude of what Frank Sinatra described as the “wee, small hours of the morning.”\n\nI grimaced at the stack of comic books, magazines, half-read paperbacks, computer cords and other clutter gathered by my bedside.\n\nI decided it must be organized. This resulted in an hours-long reorganization of bookshelves and some furniture in my bedroom.\n\nIn the sorting, I discovered a small stack of 50-cent comics I bought at Black Medicine Comics. They were well-worn books from my childhood, “reader copies” as the collectors say.\n\nSome years ago, I bought an old-fashioned spindle rack similar to the one I bought comics off of at Montross Pharmacy in Winterset when I was a boy.\n\nI keep the rack in a corner of the living room. I thought I would put the comics on the rack and go to bed.\n\nThen I realized I didn’t like the fact the comic rack was in the corner and I couldn’t really see the books I’d just put on it.\n\nAnother hours-long reorganization of furniture began.\n\nA text from my girlfriend appeared on my phone at 10 a.m. I was still up. I told her I’d been up all night. I didn’t really know why.\n\nShe asked me if I’d taken my depression and anxiety medication on time. Sometimes I wait to take my medication so I can finish writing a stack of paragraphs or some other activity. But I took them at their appointed time, 10 p.m.\n\nWe exchanged a few texts. She urged me to get some rest. I showered and went to bed, but did not feel tired. I eventually fell asleep.\n\nI don’t remember what time I woke up Sunday afternoon. I talked with a few friends by phone. I napped through some dull NFL games on TV.\n\nThe reminder chirped on my smartphone. It was time to take my medication. I did. I went into the bedroom to read and get ready for a new week.\n\nThen I looked at the stack of books I reorganized just a day before. Wouldn’t they look better if I stacked them in a completely different way?\n\nFinally, just after midnight on Monday morning, I called my therapist’s after-hours service. He called back right away.\n\nI explained the patterns of behavior over the past two days. I couldn’t figure it out. I wasn’t manic, at least I didn’t feel that way.\n\nMy therapist talked me back through recent events. I helped cover the ambush killing of two Des Moines-metro police officers. Though I am not a police officer, I have a great affinity for the men and women who do the job.\n\nThen I wrote about my childhood friend Liz fighting terminal cancer. I recently learned another friend, Steve, who used to have the desk next to me at the Register, was “in the home stretch,” as he put it, with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd then there was the election. Sure, the popular thing to do is call people upset at the presidential results “crybabies.” But good friends of mine were terribly sad and angry. I could feel it. And it hurt.\n\n“That’s a lot of stuff you’ve got going on in a short amount of time,” my therapist said.\n\n“So why am I playing Tetris with my furniture?” I asked.\n\n“It’s just something to keep your mind off the things you don’t want to talk about,” my therapist said. “Your mind engages in these projects so it doesn’t have to think about what hurts.”\n\nThat made sense. It had been a rough few weeks. Too many carbs slipped into my diet. My motivation to hit the gym practically evaporated despite the supportive atmosphere. I felt wild and out of control.\n\n“I talk to a lot of people who are feeling the same way,” my therapist said. “Do you know what I tell them? Set it aside. There’s nothing you can do about it right now. You have to live your life.”\n\nThis seemingly simple advice helped me unlock “sleep mode.”\n\nI’m still very anxious, maybe as bad as I have been in a very anxious year. But I’m doing my best to handle it, keep commenting on the passing parade and telling stories.\n\nIt isn't easy, but, then, nobody ever promised us easy.\n\nWEDNESDAY, NOV. 9, 2016\n\nClearing the mechanism\n\nI thought I was processing the grief that came with the killings of two Des Moines-metro police officers as well as could be expected until I drove to the gym last week.\n\nIn the strip mall home of CrossFit Merle Hay, a vendor put up fencing and signage for a Christmas tree lot. I thought of Des Moines Police Sgt. Tony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin.\n\nTheir families were weeks away from experiencing their first Thanksgiving and Christmas without their loved ones. Beminio was the father of three. I thought about my first Christmas without my dad nearly 28 years ago.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot and parked a few rows away from the gym. I composed myself and walked in.\n\nMy trainer and friend, Nate Yoho, seems to inherently read moods. After stretches, we started a deadlift. Deadlifting is my favorite weightlifting exercise. I can’t say why. I just like it.\n\nI pressed my mind into thinking about my form as I yanked 272 pounds from the floor for five sets of three repetitions. We did another round of three sets of three reps at 250 pounds.\n\nOn good days at the gym, my mind locks into the exercise and all noise both internally and externally fades away.\n\nIt’s a wonderful mindset. Your body strains, yet you ignore the exhaustion in favor of one more rep. You don’t even hear the music blasting on the gym speakers.\n\nThe best representation I can think of for this comes from the mediocre 1999 baseball movie “For Love of the Game.” Kevin Costner plays an aging pitcher throwing a perfect game on the last day of his career. Early in the movie, the camera pans across the jeering Yankees fans and the cacophony of noise inside Yankee Stadium. He looks in at the catcher and thinks to himself, “Clear the mechanism.” With that, the noise around him fades away and it is just pitcher, catcher and batter.\n\nThis level of engagement is rare for me. Often the exhaustion breaks my concentration.\n\nBut the elite athletes at the gym, like Nate, are practiced enough at the mental game that they can lock in more frequently and it is a marvelous thing to witness.\n\nI could not “clear the mechanism” last week, at least not in terms of getting into a zone where I was attacking the exercises without awareness of how tired I was.\n\nYet as I worked through 20 minutes of metabolic conditioning that involved rounds of carrying 53-pound kettle bells in both hands, rowing and sit-ups, my mind at least temporarily pushed out the grief.\n\nMy session ended as they usually do, with me panting on the floor in a pool of sweat, feeling an odd mixture of accomplishment and annoyance that I could not do more.\n\nAs I drank my protein shake, Nate and I talked about the fallen officers. I told him about the Christmas tree lot. Nate and I became friends after I wrote a story about the loss of his wife, Laura, to cancer three years ago.\n\nWe both paused to consider that in the beginning, everyone tries to help you cope with grief. But eventually, the ham sandwiches are all gone, people go home to their lives and you are left with a great emptiness that remains for the rest of your life.\n\nNate still feels the loss of his wife. I still miss my dad.\n\nMost days, both of us are able to “clear the mechanism,” as it were, and live our lives.\n\nBut some days, the hurt feels raw and fresh. And you are left with only one solution: Keep moving forward.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 3, 2016\n\nStrange sensation\n\nI visited my doctor, Shauna Basener, while I was on vacation last month.\n\nThe appointment was our first since she moved from a clinic in West Des Moines to the McFarland Clinic in Ames.\n\nI decided to follow her despite the extra travel time because I feel a strong sense of trust, rapport and open communication with Shauna as a doctor and a person.\n\nThis relationship is critical while dealing with chronic health issues. In my case, those issues are morbid obesity, high blood pressure and arthritis in my knees and lower back.\n\nIn one of our first visits, Shauna won my trust when she told me to stop taking an iron supplement because my blood tests showed it was unnecessary.\n\n“The best medicine is no medicine,” she said.\n\nThis is a philosophy I wholly support. This is not to say I oppose medication or regular preventative care.\n\nThe idea is to help the body function properly without the assistance of medications or supplements. I still take two medications for blood pressure, three medications for mental health issues, a daily vitamin and a fish oil supplement.\n\nBut in the time I’ve worked with Shauna, I’ve changed my physical well-being enough to stop taking medication for type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nMy blood pressure reading was good enough that Shauna considered lowering the dosage of my blood pressure medication or dropping it altogether.\n\nThis idea astounded me. I thought once a person went on blood pressure medication, it became a permanent part of the routine.\n\nBut the weight loss and increase in physical activity over the last 19 months improved my health enough that some of the chronic conditions have eased.\n\nMy blood tests during this visit showed similar promise.\n\nMy A1C test, which gives doctors a picture of my average blood sugar level for about three months, was the second-lowest (that’s good) since I began recovery.\n\nMy cholesterol levels were within acceptable ranges and improving.\n\nAnd my weight was 444.6 pounds – a loss of 118.6 pounds since I began the journey nearly 600 days ago and also my lowest mark to date.\n\nI gained 13 pounds between August and September and the thought distressed me so I feel into a deep funk complete with the usual round of negative self-talk.\n\nBetween September and my October physical, I lost those 13 pounds and three more.\n\nThis inspired an unusual emotion: hope.\n\nGetting healthier means, barring accident or catastrophe, I likely will live longer.\n\nMost of my life, I’ve thought about the end of my life.\n\nMy dad died when I was 13. My mom died when I was 14. My dad was sickly for the last several years of his life.\n\nI used to write my will and testament on wide-ruled notebook paper that I kept in my desk because I thought that was something I needed to do.\n\nOne of my favorite teachers in fourth grade died of leukemia. I remember staying home from school the day after she died and trying to will myself to die because I didn’t want to face school without her kind face and gentle manner.\n\nThroughout all my struggles – health, financial, psychological or vocational – in my 41 years, I have always thought about how my life would end.\n\nI assumed it would end badly, with lots of pain and suffering or, as I have often admitted, by my own hand.\n\nNow, though, there is a good chance that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. This represents a dramatic shift in perspective.\n\nIf I’m going to live, what am I to make of my life? I need to reshape my outlook.\n\nIt’s daunting, but it beats planning your own funeral.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 13, 2016\n\nA path forward\n\nThe pain lanced through my lower back like an electric shock.\n\nThe time was about 3 a.m. I tried to sit up in bed, but my lower back hurt so much I actually cried out.\n\nI tested the boundaries of movement. Articulation at the waist hurt the most. With some painful effort, I threw my legs over the side of the bed and pulled myself up to a standing position.\n\nI equated the harshness of the pain to the back injury that started this journey to recover from morbid obesity 19 months ago.\n\nI gingerly shuffled to the closet and fished out a prescription muscle relaxant I keep in case of emergencies. I swallowed one with some water and slowly walked into the living room.\n\nI tried to think of what might have caused this flare up. My workout at CrossFit Merle Hay earlier in the day went fine. I was tired but felt no pain or stiffness.\n\nTrainer Nate Yoho wanted to try a new movement, something called a sumo deadlift. I stood on two boxes a foot tall. I squatted and reached past my feet to grab a 35-pound kettlebell from the floor. Then I stood.\n\nThe challenge was almost like pulling 35 pounds out of a hole in the ground.\n\nAt the time we did the exercise, I felt the usual strains associated with a workout, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe finished with a metabolic conditioning cycle that involved kettlebell swings and the rowing machine. I walked – and partially ran – a mile.\n\nI drank a protein shake and a recovery drink. I sat around for a while to watch the most experienced athletes prepare for an upcoming competition.\n\nI returned to my home office to stack paragraphs and knocked off for the day in the early evening.\n\nI recalled no incidents that would have set off this tight, aching back.\n\nYet there I sat in my living room, waiting for the pain killer to kick in propped up by some extra pillows in the small of my back and barely able to move.\n\nI worried the injury would stop the progress I’ve made at the gym in recent weeks. Since a recent setback in weight loss, I’ve shifted focus from the scale to what I can do with my body.\n\nI’ll return to the scale soon enough, but confidence comes quicker and more practically through training than it does in those few anxious seconds before I step on a scale.\n\nThe pain, combined with the sluggishness that comes with muscle relaxers, sidelined me from the gym later that day.\n\nI hate to miss sessions, which is in itself something of a victory. I never thought I would enjoy training as much as I do and in such a variety of ways, from the physical exertion and strength gains to camaraderie of the trainers and athletes.\n\nI also hate to miss sessions because even though I know recovery is just as important as exercise, my brain – twisted by anxiety – always believes a missed session means my body begins to atrophy and I’ll lose all the strength and mobility I’ve gained.\n\nIt’s an irrational worry, as most of mine are, but it’s something I wrestle with in these situations.\n\nOn the day I took off and during my regular off day, I tried to stretch as often as I could. I bent over and put my palms on the floor. I cycled through the exercises I learned in physical therapy when I originally hurt my back.\n\nThe pain lingered at varying intensities, but by the end of the second day off I started to feel better. My back still hurt – especially after long periods sitting or lying down.\n\nBut I found myself texting Nate, pledging to be at our next session. I wasn’t fully recovered, but Nate is used to working around injuries.\n\nHe recently had a client with a torn bicep who came in and managed to work out. My injury was far less severe than that.\n\nI took several lessons from this frightening recurrence of back pain. First, I am in better shape and stronger than I was 19 months ago. That means my body recovers faster even when it really hurts.\n\nAnd secondly, while I might worry that every pitfall will be catastrophic, I’m slowly beginning to understand that not everything is going to end in disaster.\n\nThis is something my mental health therapist has been working on with me for years, as have my family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBut it took working out at CrossFit with Nate to finally realize there is always a path forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCT. 5, 2016\n\nCast of characters\n\nSometimes I watch them, the other athletes and trainers, as I sit on the wooden bench at the front of CrossFit Merle Hay, dabbing the sweat from my bald head and recovering my breath.\n\nIt still feels like an exaggeration to refer to myself as an “athlete” in this gym filled with men and women who look like Greek marble statues come to life.\n\nBut Nate Yoho, the gym’s owner, insists upon it. Once you heft the first weight, pull the first row and walk the first step, to Nate, you are an athlete – his athlete.\n\nWhen my workouts end, I drink a protein shake and suck water from an aluminum bottle.\n\nThey truly come in all shapes and sizes, both athletes and trainers.\n\nThere is 72-year-old Denny Joe, survivor of three open-heart surgeries. A doctor told him he would never run again. He runs nearly every day on a high school track near his home.\n\nHe works with Nate, who helps him with flexibility, strength and stamina. On a recent day, I watched Denny Joe prop himself up on his forearms and rest his ankles on a box. He held a ridged position with his abs tightened for 2 minutes. They call the exercise planking. I call it amazing.\n\nOn the days when my arthritic knees bark and I want to stay in my comfortable oversized office chair, I think of Denny Joe, the septuagenarian superman who still runs when they told him he could not.\n\nVan Marshall works alongside Nate as a trainer. He hurt his hamstring recently and then hurt it again. This stops normal people from intense workout. It turned Van into a carpenter.\n\nHe assembled workout equipment that allowed him to exercise without straining his injured muscle a third time.\n\nMy favorite: He wound a thick rope around a sled and stacked heavy weight plates atop it. With another athlete, they took turns pulling the heavy sled across the floor. While one pulled, the other did pushups.\n\nWhen I gasp for air and think I have no more to give, I think of Van and push just a little harder.\n\nMichelle is another trainer at CrossFit. She works with a young, overweight middle school girl. She pours her heart into inspiring the girl to embrace fitness the way she embraces reading and academic achievement.\n\nMichelle starts each session by walking beside the girl. I don’t know what they talk about and it’s none of my business.\n\nBut in those dark moments when I want to quit because it feels hopeless or the chemical malfunctions in my brain turn my thoughts against me, I think of Michelle and the culture of this gym. I know I never walk alone.\n\nI watch Nate as he works with other athletes. He greets everyone with a smile. He encourages, corrects, directs and pushes.\n\nHe is in top physical condition, stronger and faster than he has ever been in his 33 years. He recently set a series of personal records in competition-style workouts. Had they been in a competition, he would have finished 17th in the region and in the top 100 in the world.\n\nNate relates the accomplishments with the giddiness of a small boy. Yet I witness him reflect that same enthusiasm and joy for the gains of his athletes.\n\nWords fail to accurately reflect how much I respect this man, how honored I am by his friendship. He played minor league baseball but never cracked the big leagues, the kind of disappointment that turns many people into round-bellied storytellers at the end of the bar, loudly reliving their glory days to anyone within earshot.\n\nBut Nate rebuilt. He came home to Des Moines, became a trainer, met the love of his life, got married and opened his own gym.\n\nThen Nate lost his wife to cancer a few months before his daughter was born by surrogate. That’s the kind of twist of fate that could crack a man.\n\nNate rebuilt again. His world rotates around daughter Caralyn, who turns 3 in November. Nate plans to move into a larger site to accommodate the growth at his gym.\n\nSometimes I look at myself in the mirror and grimace at what I see. I think withering thoughts about my lumpy body, saggy skin and all the mistakes and overindulgence that led to that point.\n\nThen I think of Nate, who never judged me not on my first wheezing day when I could barely lift a 45-pound bar without pain lancing through my back and not on my most recent workout, when I tossed a tire, cradled a kettlebell under my chin while squatting and pulled ring rows for 22 minutes in a row.\n\nI think of this man who helps me three times a week push harder, get stronger and be better. And I know he does it because he cares. He wants me to succeed, sustain and achieve.\n\nSelf-discipline is a wonderful concept and not to be underestimated, but neither is teamwork. With my bent mindset, I give up on myself often.\n\nYet with this cast of characters working so hard to help themselves and each other, I shrug off the anxiety and doubt despite internal misgivings.\n\nI need only look at the faces of my teammates to find the faith to keep moving forward.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 27, 2016\n\nA better kind of scale\n\nI needed a win.\n\nThe weigh-in that showed a gain of 13 pounds over the previous month brought my spirits low. I felt as if the work I had done in increasingly intense workouts over recent months was in vain.\n\nI had the vague, unrealistic fear that I was creeping back to the nearly 600 pounds I was before I began this journey.\n\nNate Yoho, my friend and trainer at CrossFit Merle Hay, seemed to sense this when I arrived at the gym.\n\nWe started with a deadlift, my favorite weightlifting exercise. It’s the one that reminds me I once couldn’t carry a few bags of groceries without hurting myself.\n\nNow I can pull hundreds of pounds off the floor without a problem.\n\nI can’t see the muscles in my back, but my girlfriend says they are firmer, and I feel stronger.\n\nNate and I started, as always, with 10 reps of just the 45-pound bar. We started to warm up, increasing weight and decreasing repetitions.\n\nThe plates started stacking thick on both sides of the bar.\n\n“I see we're going with the no-messing-around weight today,” I said to Nate. I may have used a different word than “messing.”\n\n“We’re going for it,” Nate said.\n\nBy “it,” Nate meant a personal record. I set one several months ago at 331 pounds.\n\nAt the time, Nate said I probably could have done more, but I began to lose my form — which can lead to injury — on my final reps, so we stopped.\n\nThis time, with form locked in, I pulled from the ground to my knees, keeping my back straight, my chest up and leading with my shoulders.\n\nNate kept sliding on more plates. Finally, we reached 352 pounds, which would best the previous record by 21 pounds.\n\nI squatted into position, set my heels and yanked that bar to my waist. I held it for a second before I let the bar drop and slam to the floor.\n\nNate and I bumped fists. That felt damned good.\n\nWe dropped the weight down to 225 pounds for five sets of five reps. I focused on the form that sometimes fails as I try to set records.\n\nI squeezed my shoulder blades together and led with my upper body as I stood. I worked the rounds.\n\nWith each round completed, Nate fist-pumped on the side. He bubbled with jubilation.\n\n“This is what I do this for,” he said. “This is about you getting your life back. You’re no longer a prisoner in your own body or your own home. You don’t have to worry about hurting yourself doing everyday things.”\n\nHe reminded me I pulled 352 pounds off the floor and was closing in on a full body-weight deadlift — a major accomplishment in weightlifting, especially for a man of my girth.\n\nThen he pointed out I finished 25 reps of 225 pounds. No amount of groceries I bought was going to weigh that. That strength was mine now, to nurture and build upon.\n\nAnd that felt even better than the personal record.\n\nFor our metabolic conditioning, Nate retested me on a workout I completed twice during our time together.\n\nThe set involved declining reps on three separate exercises for time, beginning at 10 and decreasing by one until the last round was one rep.\n\nThe three exercises were rowing on the machine, push-ups and pulling a 20-pound medicine ball from the floor and throwing it down.\n\nMy first time was 18 minutes — 18 seconds. The second time I ran the gauntlet, my time went up — in part because I fiddled with the straps on the rowing machine too much.\n\nThis time, though, I felt a burning sense of purpose, a desire to rip this thing to shreds.\n\nI don’t remember much about the metabolic conditioning series other than when I felt even the slightest sense of fatigue, I screamed to myself in my head, “Next time, you do one less than this time.”\n\nWhen I pounded the medicine ball on the floor for a final time, I fell to my knees and rolled over on my back. Sweat rolled back off my bald head and pooled on the gym floor.\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n“Time,” I wheezed to Nate.\n\n“12:29,” he said. “You just beat your old best time by almost 6 minutes. You went to a different mental place to do that.”\n\nNate shook my hand. I stayed on the floor.\n\nMy chest heaved. My heart rate slowed. I smiled.\n\nI’ll take this measure of fitness over the scale every single time.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 20, 2016\n\nSetbacks and commitments\n\nMy shirt hung heavy on my sweaty frame.\n\nThe day’s workout at CrossFit Merle Hay felt good. Coach Nate Yoho put me through a timed metabolic conditioning circuit.\n\nIt involved a row, followed by a bike ride followed by a 200 meter walk with a 50-pound barbell in each hand.\n\nThe thing took 20 minutes, 10 seconds. We both wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes, but the strength of my grip faded on the back half of the 200-meter. I need to stop one more time before the finish. It cost me a few seconds.\n\nStill, I felt good. I thought of all the things I could do now that I wasn’t able to do when I when I started at the gym about nine months ago.\n\nI probably am the physically strongest I have ever been and, outside of playing basketball as a sophomore at Winterset High School, this is probably the most sustained physical activity I’ve ever done.\n\nI drank my protein shake and a recovery drink. I chatted with Nate. We talked about how my form had improved in various lifts and exercises. I am beginning to develop body awareness.\n\nI felt good and strong. I decided to drive over to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center to check my weight.\n\nWorkouts continued to increase intensity over recent weeks. The sweat and grind must surely produce a positive result.\n\nJacque Schwartz, my regular dietician, wasn’t available. Another professional familiar with these paragraphs took the measurement.\n\nMy jaw hung agape at the results. I gained 13 pounds since Aug. 11. It was the biggest rollback since I began recovery from morbid obesity more than 18 months ago.\n\nI held back tears as I slid on my shoes and socks. I hustled out to my car and collapsed into the driver’s seat. Despondency washed over me. Boy, the jerks on social media were going to love this. I can almost see the all the creative fat jokes being crafted once this column is published.\n\nThe first thought I had was to take the car down to Iowa Highway 5 south of the airport and get it up as fast as I could go and smash it into the bridge truss at top speed.\n\nI have suicidal thoughts sometimes. It is painful and embarrassing to admit, but it is true. They come from a combination of thinking errors, adverse childhood experiences and the malfunction of brain chemistry that goes along with chronic depression and acute anxiety.\n\nThis does not mean I am actively suicidal. It means that sometimes when I struggle, my mind visits upon those thoughts, usually exceptionally briefly. I first had suicidal thoughts in fourth grade after my favorite teacher died. I think once your brain cracks the seal on that kind of thinking, it always lurks in your mind even if you aren't going to act upon it. Author Susanna Kaysen, who lives with borderline personality disorder, described the persistent, illogical nature of suicidal thinking in her autobiographical book, “Girl, Interrupted.”\n\n“Once you’ve posed that question, it won’t go away,” she wrote.\n\nThat’s how suicidal thinking is for me. I think about it, usually when I screw up or believe I have disappointed people who give me their love and put their trust in me. Through behavioral therapy, I’ve learned to manage suicidal thoughts. The first thought I have is that I don’t want to cause pain to the people I love, especially Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nThen I think of the poor cop who has to see whatever is left of me at the accident scene. Or I consider the fact I might survive the attempt but permanently and severely injured.\n\nAll these thoughts pass in a few seconds or less. Usually, the real problems – sadness and disappointment – are revealed. Sadness and disappointment are rational reactions to negative events. These I can work with, unpleasant though they may be.\n\nOne note of caution here: Always take seriously someone who talks openly about suicide. I have a lot of experience wrangling these thoughts and an excellent support structure in place, but others — especially adolescents — don't have the experience to know the pain will pass.\n\nMy boss read these paragraphs and called to check on me, as one should. We had a talk. I assured her I was OK, just going through a rough patch. Talking is always a good idea. The worst that can happen is a person tells to buzz off or that they are fine. The best that can happen is they ask for help.\n\nI called my therapist and told him I was in a spiral. He asked me what might have caused the weight gain.\n\nMy best guess was too many carbohydrates. I indulged in one too many English muffins, lasagna and pizza a few times in the previous month.\n\nMy therapist emphasized that weight is but one measure of success. I was stronger. I looked better. I found a new community at the gym. I knew that, but when overwhelmed by the disappointment, I could not see it.\n\nMy therapist asked me what my plan was. I decided to cut my daily calorie intake from 2,500 calories to 2,250. I planned to more vigorously eschew carbohydrates.\n\nI also planned to break up my total calorie intake into three or four smaller meals instead of some snacks or protein supplements and one large, high-calorie meal.\n\nBy the time I finished detailing the plan, a kind of calm settled in. My therapist always says it helps to say things out loud. The negative thoughts sound silly and the positive ones make more sense.\n\nI texted the bad news to Nate.\n\n“Life happens,” he said. “I’ve never had a client who lost more than 100 pounds that didn’t slide back. Did you think you were going to be the first?”\n\nAt first, I thought Nate unsympathetic. Then I remembered a story he told me while he was playing minor league baseball some years ago.\n\nHe went through a 0-for-40 slump. He was the fourth outfielder on the team and only played once or twice a week.\n\n“I’d go 0-for-5 and sit for four days,” Nate said. “Nobody wanted to be around me. I was in a bad mood all the time.”\n\nThe lesson, though, is that nobody bats 1.000. I made some bad decisions with food and it caught up with me. I already had a plan in place to improve.\n\nYes, the usual trolls would come in via social media or email with their scolds and finger-wagging about the fat man who got fatter.\n\nI don’t have to write about the dark places my mind goes or the pain I feel when I don’t reach a goal. I choose to do so because setbacks, mistakes and failures are a part of recovery. Pretending that they aren't is simply a lie.\n\nSuch challenges matter less than what one does about them once they’re presented.\n\nI was back at the gym Monday afternoon, lifting weights, doing push-ups, burpies, squats, dumbbell snatches and kettlebell swings.\n\nThe journey continued.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 13, 2016\n\nGetting to the good stuff\n\nForty seconds remained in the 15-minute workout.\n\nAt CrossFit Merle Hay, where I continue my ongoing battle against morbid obesity, they call it “AMRAP” – as many repetitions as possible in a set time period.\n\nThe menu of exercises included five “wall balls,” which involves squatting with a 20-pound medicine ball at your chest and standing up, throwing the ball to a mark on the wall in front of you and catching it, a 10-calorie exercise bike ride and 15 sit-ups.\n\nNate changed the form on the sit-ups. In the past, when my belly was larger and my back weaker, the goal was to get my hands to my knees.\n\nThis day he wanted me to get my hands to my toes, tapping my fingertips on the 70-pound dumbbells I hooked my toes under while doing the activity.\n\nWhen he first described it, I thought I couldn’t do it. I found I was able to do it with relative ease. This, of course, changed as the workout continued and my body tired.\n\nThe workout was near complete and I’d made three full rounds and was two sit-ups away from four complete rounds. But my abdominal muscles – I promise there are some under all of the fat rolls – started to fail.\n\nI needed to hit two more sit-ups with 40 seconds. I hit one. But on the final try, my muscles just surrendered and I fell back.\n\nNate hollered for me to try again, counting down the seconds on the clock.\n\nI tried and got about two-thirds of the way there, but my gut muscles had no more left to give.\n\nI rolled over and pulled my knees to my chest. I sweated and gasped on the rubbery gym floor. Nate gave me a fist bump. The final tally marked 119 reps.\n\nThis is the good stuff, I thought, out of gas and exhausted.\n\nHow did it come to pass that such a feeling of exhaustion became “the good stuff?”\n\nIn recent weeks, this job had been getting to me. I live with acute anxiety disorder. My brain twists small problems into big problems and sometimes no problems into big problems.\n\nI was really struggling with a few work-related things: jerks on social media, worries about convincing a broad audience that it’s worth paying for the content in The Register and so on.\n\nMy bosses assured me they were pleased with my work and that they were happy with how my paragraphs connected with our audience.\n\nMy brain was misfiring and I was in a loop. And when you’re an anxiety sufferer in the middle of a downward spiral, very few things can jolt you back to clarity.\n\nI worked with my therapist. He can usually do it, but I wasn’t settling to a normal rhythm. Everything felt uncomfortable and overwhelming.\n\nI’ll talk to my girlfriend about her cats or my buddy Paul from Memphis about stupid TV shows and bad movies, which is nearly all of them.\n\nBut that nagging feeling that my life was out of control and everything was going to end badly persisted. I woke up in the morning in a nearly full panic and found myself extra surly and suspicious.\n\nIt reached a point where I wanted to write a column that poked fun at one of Iowa’s sacred subjects but I was afraid to do it because of the beating I would take on social media, through email and phone calls.\n\nThat was the moment I knew I needed to take a timeout. I took FMLA leave to clear my head and bring the anxiety symptoms back into manageable ranges.\n\nI’m an insecure person. Lots of people are, maybe most of us are. I want to be liked and loved, but I’ve picked a strange occupation to seek adulation in the age of angry discourse augmented by social media.\n\nStill, an important part of my job is challenging the audience with ideas counter to the status quo. If I’m afraid to do that, I can’t be the kind of columnist I want to be and I might as well turn in my laptop.\n\nI took 11 days off, including the Labor Day holiday and two weekends. I rested. I read. I eschewed social media. I hung out with friends. I tried to get my sleep schedule back on track.\n\nAnd I hit the gym.\n\nI played catch with Nate and Van Marshall, a trainer at the gym. I ran through the workouts despite arthritic knees aching with the barometric pressure shifts during a rainy period.\n\nAnd the days I was at the gym, I felt settled, even gruntled. There’s science behind this. Workouts produce endorphins and serotonin, which lead to better moods and less anxiety.\n\nBut the routine of it – working out to near-exhaustion, hanging out with the crew – was as important as any of the physicality involved.\n\nAbout eight days into my sabbatical, I woke up and felt fine. My gut was calm. My brain was active and eager to be at the gym.\n\n“Today is the first day in about two months that I’ve felt good,” I said to Nate.\n\n“It’s about time,” Nate said.\n\nI agreed.\n\nBack to the recent workout: I lay on the floor in a kind of sultry daze.\n\n“Did you see there is a Part C?” Nate said. He meant there was another round to the workout. My brain cursed him, but I fought my way to my feet.\n\nHe wanted me to walk or run a mile, not for time. I restrained my profanity again. I drank a protein shake. I got my wind back. I hit the bricks.\n\nMy mind worked ahead. As I navigated the bumpy, pockmarked pavement behind the gym, I already was thinking of climbing the long hill on the access road.\n\nBy the time I was at the access road, I was thinking about the turn back to the building to complete the first lap.\n\nMy mind was working at the same frenetic pace it does during anxiety attacks. But instead of shredding my psyche with worry, it was planning my attack to finish this mile in less than 20 minutes.\n\nI jogged the last 100 yards or so and finished at 18 minutes, 54 seconds. I was out of breath. I sipped a recovery drink and sweated on the bench while Nate worked with other clients.\n\nYes, I thought, this really is the good stuff.\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 30, 2016\n\nHead games\n\nThe kettle bell with the green stripes at the base of the handle weighs 53 pounds.\n\nRust peeks through portions of its rounded base where the black paint has chipped away.\n\nChalk dust coats the ball with clean spots made by drips of sweat striking the lead weight in a series of swings to end a grueling workout.\n\nThrough the loop on the handle, you can see the obscured image of a man exhausted, splayed out on the floor with his seemingly lifeless hand laying on the soft padded floor of Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay gym.\n\nThis portly paragraph-stacker unceremoniously dropped the kettle bell to the floor after 20 swings and collapsed in to what Nate calls “the CrossFit position.”\n\nI began the workout with some trepidation. My arthritic knees ached with the recent humidity and volatile barometric pressure.\n\nRecent workouts challenged the joints’ stability with jump roping and light jogging. I warmed up slowly on the humid day.\n\nAs always, Nate asked how my body felt. I warned him my knees ached, but, as always, I was not at the gym to be comfortable.\n\nWe began with an exercise called “thrusters.” The lift involves putting weight on a bar, holding it at the tops of your shoulders in front of your body with your elbows pointed out.\n\nYou squat and then thrust up from the squat, careful to keep your heels on the floor, and then push the weight above your head as your hips swing forward.\n\nMy knees hurt, but they eventually loosened up or enough adrenaline flowed that I did not notice the ache as badly.\n\nThe cardio portion of the workout came next. Nate lined up nine activities to be completed for time. It began with a 20-calorie row, a 100-meter run (run!), and 30-calorie bike ride, followed by another row, run, ride and run.\n\nThe capstone was 20 swings of the 53-pound kettle bell.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the notion of a 447-pound man running. Brian Brown will not be recruiting me for any special events at next year’s Drake Relays.\n\nBut running is something I’ve largely avoided since maybe playing a few pickup basketball games at Bell Center when I was a Drake University student more than 20 years ago.\n\nWhen I began this recovery from morbid obesity, a 156-foot walk was enough to drench me with sweat and force me to sit down, near complete exhaustion.\n\nI was in slightly better shape when Nate invited me to his gym in late January this year. But running and jumping were far from my mind.\n\nYet in recent weeks, we’ve started running and jumping. It’s difficult and taxes my knees in particular.\n\nBut my knees are strong. A doctor took X-rays when I weighed close to 600 pounds. There was still good cartilage and space between the bones. I was simply putting a lot of pressure on the joints, which caused the arthritis.\n\nNow I’m challenging those joints again, though with a body that is much lighter. Still, they hurt. Yet I keep pushing them. Because something strange is happening to me.\n\nI want to see how hard I can really go.\n\nI am good at rowing and the stationary bike. I keep a good pace at those, even when fatigue sets in. Running is new.\n\nNate said I could walk the 100 meters if I needed to. I pledged to run all four rounds, even if it was barely a jog.\n\nI stayed on the balls of my feet and dug in when I needed to climb the hill back to the gym.\n\nI regained my breath on the bike or rower. I still went hard, but I’ve become strong enough in those exercises that I can perform at a higher level and still recoup some of my energy for activities that are more taxing.\n\nNate set no time goal for me, but mentally I wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes. On the last 100 meters, my creaky knees really ached on the downhill run alongside the gym’s building.\n\nI turned to run back to the gym and I turned it on. Now, I don’t want anyone getting visions of Usain Bolt here. It was a slow, plodding, clopping graceless run.\n\nBut for a man of my girth on this point in my journey, it was a damn Olympic sprint.\n\nThe last round was 20 kettle bell swings. My breath was shallow. I decided to break it down into four sets of five swings. I made the first five and took a break.\n\nMy gray T-shirt was heavy with sweat. My arms and legs were slick.\n\nI swung five more and thought for a moment that I did not have two rounds in me. I leaned on the stationary bike for support. I gasped for air.\n\nNate suggested I try six swings to get more than halfway home. I decided I wanted to be done.\n\nI swung the final 10 swings in the third round. The kettle bell landed on the floor. I followed, spent and gasping.\n\nThe elapsed time was 17 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nNate shook my hand. He let me be for a few minutes while I regained my breath.\n\nI propped myself up on my elbows.\n\nNate said I’d been hitting the floor a lot after workouts recently. I said he was pushing me harder.\n\nHe corrected me.\n\n“No, you’re breaking through mentally,” Nate said. “You’re going to that place in your head that really wants to push as far as you can go.”\n\nI understood exactly what he meant. Look at all I can do now when 18 months ago, exhausted after 156 feet, I asked Stefanie Kirk, physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, if I had any hope.\n\nNow my mindset is: Just how far can I go?\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 23, 2016\n\nJump, jump around\n\nI bought a jump rope.\n\nIf Vegas took odds on what this paragraph stacker would buy, jump rope would not have even been on the board.\n\nBut I bought one because my trainer, CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho, said it was time to integrate jumping into my workouts.\n\nWe worked on some light jumping, just a few inches off the ground. My arthritic knees took the pounding fairly well.\n\nSo I shelled out almost $25 for a jump rope. This isn’t actually a rope. It’s a thin aluminum cable with slim handles with rubber grips.\n\nThe elegant little thing is a far cry from the nylon jump rope with wood handles I received for participating in Jump Rope for Heart in fifth grade.\n\nScores of jump ropes hang on hooks at the gym. But Nate worried that none would be long enough for my 6-foot-4 frame.\n\nSo I invested in exercise equipment. It even comes with a small nylon storage bag to keep it tightly and tidily wound inside my gym bag.\n\nI have not jumped rope since it was a unit in physical education class, likely in elementary or middle school. I recall charts on the wall with various tricks one could do.\n\nMy favorite was “side swing,” which involved swinging the rope on each side of your body and no actual jumping.\n\nBut this is a new era. CrossFit athletes do something called “double-unders,” in which they spin the rope so quickly and jump high enough that the rope clears their feet twice for every jump.\n\nThis big-and-tall man is not ready for double-unders. I am barely capable of single jumps. But once the jump rope arrived, Nate decided to incorporate it into the metabolic conditioning.\n\nThe act of getting a body that weighs 447 pounds to jump up repeatedly while spinning a rope underneath is somewhat comical if observed from the outside.\n\nYet I was surprised how easily my morbidly obese form took to the rhythm. I made six jumps unbroken the first time. Nate adjusted the length of the rope and I was able to do an unbroken stretch of 16 jumps.\n\nThis will hardly set a world record, but it almost certainly is a personal one.\n\nJumping rope reminds me of swimming. It’s something done effortlessly as a child but somehow became exceptionally exhausting as an adult.\n\nI felt my heavy body pile-driving into the gym floor with each leap, yet I kept jumping the line as quickly and often as I could.\n\nNate included jump-ropes in our metabolic conditioning for the day. The series of exercises involved a 10-calorie row, 10 push-ups and 10 rope jumps over 18 minutes.\n\nThese metabolic conditioning routines are rough. I try to get through as many rounds as possible, but I often find myself gasping for air early in the process.\n\nThe arms always go first. By the second or third round, they might as well be those flags waving wildly in those wacky inflatable tube men on display at used car lots.\n\nThe legs hold out better, to a point. But I often feel the burn in my quadriceps earlier than I like.\n\nNate would admonish me that I am much stronger than I was when we started in January. But I stay in the moment.\n\nOne pull, one jump, one push-up. There is no past or future, only now.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of that cycle, the jump rope became the easy part. I got a rhythm fairly quickly and made it through 10 jumps unbroken three or four times.\n\nAh, but there were consequences. The first time we used the jump rope, it was a Thursday workout. Nate had just returned from a trip out east.\n\nTypically, Thursday workouts are a little lighter. The body is beat up from going hard at the beginning of the week. The Thursday workout is just to get the blood flowing.\n\nBut Nate’s assistants led me through workouts earlier that week. He did not see me grind through. So he decided to bring his own grind.\n\nThe workout ended and my legs quivered.\n\nThe next day, my knees ached as they hadn’t done since the early days of physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nI invested in a large bottle of ibuprofen, which cost almost as much as the jump rope. But hopefully the 1,600 pills will last longer.\n\nThe medicine did the trick for the inflammation. A light weekend allowed the knees to recover.\n\nBut after Monday’s workout, I texted Stefanie to ask her what muscles were hurting. I described the location of the pain.\n\nShe sent me the name of the muscle and a link to a health website to learn more about it. My trouble spots were the hip flexor and something called the quadratus lumborum.\n\nSo not only am I jumping rope like I did in middle school, I’m learning physiology through aches and pains after workouts.\n\nI took physiology from a great teacher at East High School named Paul Sloan.\n\nI don’t recall how well I did in the class, but if you’re reading, Mr. Sloan, you were right. I probably should have paid more attention.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 17, 2016\n\nNew sensation\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of anything. I’ve typed that sentence before, but I find it especially true as I evaluate the changes in my life while recovering from morbid obesity.\n\nThe latest weigh-in at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center shows a loss of 116 pounds since March 2015 and a decrease of my body mass index of more than 22 percent.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, but I am headed in the right direction — and have been nearly 18 months. My diet is better, but hardly perfect.\n\nMy exercise routines at CrossFit Merle Hay continue to grow in intensity. I probably am physically stronger now than I have been at any point in my life.\n\nStill, sometimes my brain defaults to running my body as if it were still 563 pounds.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons I began this journey was because I hurt my back carrying in groceries from the car. I carried in all my groceries at once because my body wasn’t fit enough to make two trips to the car without serious exhaustion.\n\nIn a recent workout, I set a personal record of deadlifting more than 330 pounds, under coach Nate Yoho’s guidance.\n\nYet, still, whenever I get home from the grocery store with the bags in my trunk, I think, “Oh, man, am I going to hurt my back again?”\n\nI eat well, but I do not carry 330 pounds of groceries at any point. I doubt I carry in 50 pounds of groceries.\n\nAnd the other day, as part of a circuit workout, I carried a 53-pound kettlebell in each hand on a 100-meter walk as a part of a series of exercises in metabolic conditioning. It wasn’t a strain.\n\nCarrying the groceries isn’t, either. But my mind thinks I can’t, even when my body obviously can.\n\nIt’s a strange thing.\n\nWhen I weighed 563 pounds, one of the most difficult tasks I faced six days a week was walking the 150 yards or so from my apartment building to the mailboxes in the parking lot.\n\nAt my worst, I would drive my car to the mailbox, get my mail and then park as close as I could to my door.\n\nNate and I have just begun to work on running and jumping in workouts — two activities I thought my body would never be able to handle again. I even bought a jump rope.\n\nI walked a mile the other day for time. I don’t remember the time, but it wasn’t bad, and I wasn’t out of gas.\n\nWe’re going to try a jogging and walking combo the next time we test on the mile.\n\nSo, of course I can traverse 150 yards without a problem. I just think that I can’t.\n\nSo I hesitate. I think, “Oh, that is so far.”\n\nThen I walk and think, “Why was I worried about this at all?”\n\nOne of the things my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, and I worked on early in recovery was getting in and out of the car without pain.\n\nTo this day, some 116 pounds lighter and much stronger, I often pause with my door open, dreading the idea of standing up and getting out of the car.\n\nI know I can do it without needing to use my arms to pull myself up on the frame of the door and roof of the car.\n\nBut I still think about it.\n\nI suppose this will eventually pass.\n\nI felt a little milestone recently at the gym when Van Marshall, a CrossFit trainer who was pinch-hitting for Nate while he was out of town, gave me a lengthy workout.\n\nI looked at the slate he outlined for me. It was one of those scaled workouts that decreases by one rep each session, beginning at 10 and ending at one.\n\nThe circuit involved rowing, ring rows and a weightlifting exercise. The whole thing was topped off with an 800-meter walk.\n\nI looked at that workout and thought, “Yeah, I can do that.”\n\nNow that is real progress, friends.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 10, 2016\n\nLessons in mental health\n\nDear Natasha,\n\nYour therapist emailed me asking for a copy of a recent column I wrote about an incident in my childhood in which my mother briefly locked me in the basement and how that affected how I think about the world.\n\nYour therapist kept with the ethics of her profession. She did not tell me your name or anything specific about your case other than you, too, struggled with adverse childhood experiences.\n\nNatasha, as far as I know, is not your real name. I picked the name Natasha because there is a Natasha Romanov bobblehead figure on my desk as I type. Natasha is also known as the superhero Black Widow and is played by Scarlett Johansson in the “Avengers” movies.\n\nAll your therapist said was that you struggled as a child and were working toward ways to change how that affects you.\n\nThis is good. This is great. It is an important first step, maybe the most important one of your journey. I wanted to pass along a few things I have learned in my efforts to regain mental health and physical health.\n\nYou are not alone. It seems that way, especially in the darkness of night when there is no one to talk to and the anxiety and depression creeps in. But there are millions of us out there who live with mood disorders. Yes, we struggle. But through the struggle we learn about ourselves and the better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to accept who we are and become the person we want to be.\n\nIt’s going to hurt. There is no pain-free path through the suffering we’ve endured or our current challenges. Remembering the things that we survived, whatever they may be, hurts. Sometimes it hurts worse than the day it happened. But you can get past the pain and on the other side of that is understanding. I wish there was an easier way toward personal enlightenment, but there isn’t. I promise you, though, it’s worth it.\n\nClosure is a lie. The link between adult behavior and childhood experience is well-studied and scientifically proven. Still, the world is not made up of thinkers. People like snap judgments and simple answers. They will tell you to “just get over it already” or that you need to seek something called “closure.” Maybe you will even tell yourself these things. These are fantasies. “Closure” is brought up when people who are tired of talking to you about the things that hurt the most. There is no such thing as closure. The most painful moments in our lives, be it the death of a loved one or a hardship endured, are with us for the rest of our lives. We never “get over” them. We just reach a point of where we understand that pain is a part of our identity.\n\nA reason is not an excuse. As you continue on your wellness journey, you will begin to understand the links between your current behavioral issues and their roots in your past. Still, you must accept responsibility for the mistakes you make now and in the future. You may not have had an easy go of it so far. That’s true for lots of people. Everyone makes mistakes and will for the entirety of their lives. Through therapy, you’re investigating the causes of the thinking errors that lead to patterns of mistakes. But the only way we make progress is by accepting our faults with our strengths and owning the person we are as a whole.\n\nKeep moving forward. You will fail. You will still have bad days. There is no such thing as a perfect person and there’s no sense in shredding your sense of self-worth because you’re not perfect. Remember that no matter how hard life hits you, no matter how often our brain chemistry twists our thoughts into knives that cut us so deeply, we are still standing. Survival is no small feat. Don't take it for granted. There is a difference between surviving and living. And the key to that is accepting that you are deserving of love, dignity and respect. I work on that every day and haven't come to fully accept it. But I, like we all are, am a work in progress.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel P. Finney, fellow traveler\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 3, 2016\n\nThe gauntlet\n\nCrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho wrote the day’s workout plan on the black dry erase board in yellow marker.\n\nHe said it would be a challenge. I read the list. I thought it was attempted murder.\n\nStill, in nearly eight months working with Nate, I’ve yet to refuse one of his “challenges.” The tasks daunted me.\n\nThe first round consisted of 60 reps of squatting and tossing a 14-pound ball to hit a target on the wall, 50-calorie row and 40 reps of a weightlifting exercise.\n\nA five-minute break followed.\n\nThen came 40 swings of a 35-pound kettlebell, a 30-calorie bike ride and 20 pickups and tosses of a 40-pound ball.\n\nThen came a seven-minute rest.\n\nThe final round was 20 “thrusters,” a chore that involves squatting with weight on a bar across your back and then pushing the weight over your head, 10 jumps onto a platform and five burpies, a kind of torture that can barely be described without profanity.\n\nI was halfway through squatting and tossing the 14-pound ball against the wall when the I first thought I was never going to make it through this insanity.\n\nMy shoulders burned so bad somewhere through the first weightlifting exercise that I was glad to be bald for I would surely never be able to wash my hair again.\n\nI remember the first break. My legs and arms quivered. I could barely lift my water-filled University of Iowa Iowa women’s basketball tumbler, a recent gift from my dear friends Lisa Bluder, Jan Jensen and Jenni Fitzgerald.\n\nI thought for sure I was going to throw up each time I leaned over to pick up the kettlebell for a series of swings. I thought I might actually pass out in the humidity. My forearms were slick with sweat.\n\nMy shirt, one of those newfangled fabrics that’s supposed to wick moisture away from the body, was heavy with sweat. Apparently the designers had not consulted Nate Yoho when they made that wicking promise.\n\nI kind of enjoyed the second round of ball throwing. I picked up the sand-filled ball, hefted it to my shoulder and let it fall to the ground behind me. I repeated the process 20 times.\n\nI like throwing things on the floor. It feels like something you should get in trouble for. Yet in the gym, under the right circumstances, such activity is rewarded.\n\nI can’t remember the seven-minute break. I know I took it. I drank water. I’m sure I hurt everywhere and felt spent. But my psychologist says the brain doesn’t remember pain. It’s a good thing. If it did, I would never get out of bed.\n\nI recall Nate saying near the end of the break that I should walk around a bit to loosen up. The first task of the final round was thrusters. I botched the first three reps before Nate corrected me.\n\nAt this point, I only had so many reps of anything left in me. It was no time to start losing form. I recovered.\n\nThe jumps came easy. Somewhere Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, is squealing. When I first came to see her about 18 months ago, I couldn’t walk 156 feet. Now I was jumping. It was only a few inches onto a soft platform, but still — jumping.\n\nThen came the burpies. No one likes burpies. The fittest person in Nate’s gym will groan at the notion of burpies. A burpie is an exercise in which you touch your thighs and chest to the ground, hop to a standing position and then jump.\n\nExperienced athletes often jump over a weight bar. My goal is to jump enough to get my feet off the floor and clap my hands above my head.\n\nI did 30 burpies to close out a workout session earlier that week. I had “burpie burns” on both knees — red scabs from where the fabric of my shorts rubbed against my knees so much it created bloody sores.\n\nI needed to complete just five burpies to end the session. I felt like a building collapsing each time I hit the floor. But I fell five times and got up five times.\n\nThe workout ended. I survived.\n\nNate showed me the timer on his phone. I had worked out for an hour straight.\n\n“How does that feel?” Nate said as he offered me a fist bump.\n\n“Awful,” I said.\n\nThat was a lie. It felt fantastic. I mean I was spent. If he had asked me to do one more thing, I definitely would have thrown up.\n\nBut consider: I weigh about 450 pounds with arthritic knees. I made it through nine different exercises with a total of 275 repetitions.\n\nIf you’d asked me before I started if I thought I could make it through all that, I would have scoffed.\n\nYet I did.\n\n“I didn’t think I had it in me,” I said to Nate.\n\n“There’s always more left than you think there is,” he said.\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 26, 2016\n\nYesterdays matter today\n\nMorbid obesity is a medical diagnosis, but I also look at it as a symptom of my complex psychological profile.\n\nI’ve written often about the close connections between mental wellness and physical wellness, in particular the relationship of obesity to adverse childhood experiences. But I rarely write about the experiences themselves.\n\nToday, I want to share one story, a milder one, from my childhood as a way of talking about how patterns of behavior formed in my brain that continue to contribute to mental and physical health problems some 26 years after my mother died.\n\nI was a small boy. I’m not sure how old.\n\nWe lived in the baby blue house on Lynner Drive off of what was then known as Harding Road in northwest Des Moines.\n\nMy father was a traveling salesman. He was often away.\n\nMy mother could be loving and caring. But her moods were volatile. She took many medications for a variety of ailments both real and imagined.\n\nSome of the medications include opiate-derivative painkillers that now are illegal because of their highly addictive nature and side effects that include severe short-term memory loss.\n\nI didn’t know any of this at the time. What I knew was that if Mom was sleeping, it was best not to interrupt that because you never knew if you were going to get Loving Mom or Other Mom.\n\nI was so afraid of Other Mom that on more than one night, when she slept through dinnertime — which happens when you are on heavy painkillers — I crawled on my hands and knees to the kitchen and poured myself a bowl of Lucky Charms and crawled back to my room.\n\nI crawled because I didn’t want to risk waking Mom. Loving Mom would have made me toast and been apologetic.\n\nOther Mom would have been apoplectic that I was out in the kitchen dirtying dishes, and she probably would have sworn she made dinner, even if she had not.\n\nOne day, Mom slept in her room. I was looking for two comic books. I wanted to trace the art on notebook paper.\n\nOne was an issue of reprints of the Invaders, a World War II superhero team that included Captain America. The other was an issue of the Avengers, now the basis of blockbuster movies.\n\nI was fairly certain the comics were in the cream-colored bag with yellow handles that had a Joe Cool Snoopy silk-screened on the side. I kept things to do in that bag, activity books, colors and so on.\n\nWhen my parents went places, rarely were there things for children to do. I was expected to be seen and not heard.\n\nThe bag was in the basement. I was not supposed to go to the basement without permission, but I decided to risk it.\n\nI went downstairs and found the bag, but the comics were not in it. Mom appeared behind me.\n\n“WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE BASEMENT?” she asked. It was Other Mom, and I was in big trouble.\n\nI stammered an explanation. She would have none of it. The argument was brief, one-sided and loud.\n\nIt concluded with Mom saying, “WELL IF YOU LIKE IT DOWN HERE SO MUCH, YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE!”\n\nShe flipped off the light, slammed the basement door and latched the hook and chain.\n\nI tried to push the door open, but she slammed it onto my arm and I withdrew. The darkness scared me.\n\nMy feet were bare and there were sometimes creepy little water bugs on the concrete tile floor.\n\nI waited until I thought she was gone. I was a husky boy, even when I was small. I opened the door as far as the chain would allow and leaned in until the chain ripped loose of the door frame.\n\nI hustled up to my room, closed the door and nothing was said of the incident again.\n\nThe next day, Loving Mom took me to the Target down the hill to buy some “Star Wars” toys.\n\nEven typing that story today, I feel a tightness in my chest, a primal kind of fear that is hard to explain.\n\nI’ve written about schema before — behavior patterns set as children as a reaction to environmental stimuli.\n\nThere were three ways I learned as a boy to cope with the potential for Other Mom: eating sugary foods, watching TV and buying toys, comics and books.\n\nAs a child, these were effective survival strategies.\n\nBut they have led to unhealthy behaviors as an adult, some of which I have finally begun to address directly through psychoactive medication and behavioral therapy.\n\nYet whenever I feel stress — whether it be a performance evaluation at work, a cruel comment from a reader or simply an unexpected change in plans — I default to these reactions.\n\nI am a spendthrift. It is a terrible habit that I’ve learned is not uncommon among people who struggle with mood disorders.\n\nHistorians, for example, say Winston Churchill, who lived with depression, was constantly in need of money after he left the prime minister’s office.\n\nI have spent myself into bankruptcy once. I continue to struggle with overspending.\n\nSome people use the cute name “shopaholic” to describe the affliction. But this isn’t enjoying sales at Von Maur.\n\nThis is me trying to buy a sense of security and safety. My apartment looks like a combination toy, book and DVD store. And still I buy more.\n\nI should pause to note I don't blame my late mother for the mistakes I make as an adult. The authorship of those errors rests only with me.\n\nBut there is a difference between a reason and an excuse. This is an examination of the root cause.\n\nIt's the simplest and most human of all: I am insecure.\n\nMost of us are insecure to a degree. Mine is both chronic and acute.\n\nIt is strange that I chose a trade in which I would put so much of myself up for public scrutiny, but that is a column for another day.\n\nSometimes it’s hard for people to understand that things that happen to us as children affect how we feel about ourselves and act as adults.\n\nIt was a long time ago, the thinking goes. Let it go.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not the way the brain works. It takes time to build new schema and the struggle goes on.\n\nThe good news is Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who took me in after my parents died, are thrifty. They saved 4 cents of every nickel they ever earned.\n\nThey counsel me on debt management and spending. I know I frustrate them because of my struggles turning off the spending spigot. But we make progress.\n\nIt really is the same principle as working out at the gym or losing weight. One starts and moves forward.\n\nThere will be setbacks, weight gains, missed reps on the dumbbells and money spent that should have been saved.\n\nThe best I or anyone can do is get up tomorrow and try again.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2016\n\nA fitting tale\n\nMy friend Yvonne sent me a gift card to a big-and-tall men’s store for my recent birthday. She suggested I get myself something to celebrate my smaller frame after losing nearly 110 pounds since last March.\n\nI drove to West Des Moines with some trepidation. Yes, I’ve lost weight and it is both visible to myself and others but also measurable in gains in physical activity and health.\n\nBut lost weight does not always translate into a trimmer frame. The body loses weight asymmetrically. Some parts shrink quickly, others seem to desperately hang onto the fat.\n\nThen there is the problem I have described before of hanging skin. I was more than 560 pounds when I began this recovery. That extra weight stretched some of the skin in my body beyond its natural elasticity.\n\nAs I have lost weight, the skin has not shrunk to fit, so to speak. So I have great folds of flesh in my midsection that were once fully filled with fat now dangling at my beltline and below like the deflated envelope of a hot air balloon.\n\nShopping for clothes was never my favorite exercise, fat or otherwise. I have an odd predilection to either loud, brightly colored Hawaiian-style shirts or navy blue golf shirts and khaki slacks.\n\nVariety may be the spice of life, but the wrong shirt will hang in my closet for years unworn – much to the frustration of Mom 2.0, who for years try to style me up only to see me favor navy blue and khaki.\n\nThis much I will say about shopping for larger sizes for the good: 20 years ago, shopping for what was called “husky” clothes was an adventure in awful fashion.\n\nIt was as if manufacturers scoured the notebooks of the D- students at fashion design schools and told their factories to make that peach and cream stripped shirt, only really big with a pocket on the left breast and an elastic waistband at the bottom.\n\nToday, I can find clothes emblazoned with logos of my favorite sports teams, comic book characters and other pop culture ephemera. Still, I trend toward the navy blue golf shirts and khaki. There are very few places where such attire isn’t considered acceptable.\n\nDespite the expanded selection, there is always a lot of emotion tied up in trying on clothes. I’ve worked hard not to make this journey about a single number – my weight.\n\nBut almost as haunting as my weight is the size of my pants. The number on the scale can be kind of abstract after a bit, but few things terrorize the psyche as much as trying to button and zip up a pair of jeans that once fit loosely.\n\nStill, I was realistic as I selected several sizes of my current brand of khakis from the rack. All the exercise at the gym, the swimming and the diet would still count even if my pant size had not changed.\n\nI tried on a pair two sizes smaller than my current pants. I knew this wouldn’t work. This was sort of a Hail Mary. My current pants are very loose, but comfortably so. I like my pants a bit on the baggy side.\n\nI was right. Two sizes down was too far to go. I couldn’t button them. I shed them and tried the next size up.\n\nThis was the real test. Where was I at? Had my circumference at the waste shrank along with the number on the scale.\n\nI slid them on. Not a bad fit, I thought. I buttoned and zipped them with ease. These are all good signs. But there is a final test that all pants must endure before I will pay money for them: How do they sit?\n\nWhen I sit, that’s when those folds of flesh at the waist bunch up into what some inelegantly describe as a “front butt.” I took a deep breath and sat. And … fail.\n\nThe otherwise nicely fitting pants pulled taut over my belly. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I would be uncomfortable and self-conscious, especially with the pockets filled with my keys, wallet, smartphone, pens, notebooks and sundry other items.\n\nIn the past, this sort of thing would have sent me on a spiral, feeling as if all the work had been for naught.\n\nInstead, and pleasantly so, I felt only vaguely disappointed. I know I am healthier. I also the journey is still in its early phases. My current khakis are made of sturdy material. I’ll wear them a little loose for a while longer.\n\nI spent the gift card on a T-shirt with superheroes on it and a polo shirt made of that material that wicks sweat away from the body. I even broke form with the color. It’s a pleasant dark gray.\n\nMONDAY, JULY 11, 2016\n\nDon't cheat, just eat\n\nA while back a reader stopped me in Tasty Tacos. He was a follower of Making Weight and wondered if my three taco meal was a “cheat day.”\n\nThe fellow was good-natured and lacked malice. It was, I thought, an honest question.\n\nI told the man I don’t believe in cheat days. I’m allotted a specific number of calories per day – 2,500. When I reach that number, I stop eating.\n\nThis isn’t to imply I have a perfect record on that. I go over a smidgen here and there and sometimes more than a smidgen.\n\nEstimating calories can be tricky even with the help of a quality smartphone app such as MyFitnessPal, my preferred calorie counter.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to use most of those calories up on food that is high in nutrients and low in certain fats, sugars, simple carbohydrates and chemicals.\n\nSo I could eat 2,500 calories worth of Twinkies, but I’m not going to get much nutrition out of that. And it won’t do my type 2 diabetes much good, either.\n\nThat said, I don’t go in for the “cheat day” concept. We can all make better choices about what we put into our bodies, but none of us are perfect.\n\nI would fare poorly on a diet of mostly greens, a few fruits and some meat. So, yes, sometimes an English muffin or even deep dish pizza finds its way onto my plate.\n\nI mitigate these calories by planning. For example, a buddy took me out for my birthday a few weeks ago. I wanted to go the Wig & Pen in Ankeny and indulge in their glorious deep dish pizza.\n\nWe split a large. That was four slices for me. I looked it up in advance. Those four slices amounted to 1,400 calories. We ate side salads with the meal.\n\nI still had room within my calorie goal for a glass of milk and a protein bar before bed.\n\nObviously I wouldn’t want to eat deep dish pizza every day. That would be counterproductive. But once in a while is fine, especially if I’m keeping up with my exercise schedule and making regular trips to the swimming pool.\n\nThe idea of cheat days bugs me for a couple of reasons. First, I think it encourages binging, which is a behavior that one simply must avoid to lose weight and get fit.\n\nSecondly, the “cheat” part of the concept implies you should feel guilty about the food you enjoy. That kind of thinking leads to shame and hopelessness that can lead to a shattered diet plan.\n\nI’m all stocked up on guilt and shame for this lifetime. So I’m not going to feel guilty about what I eat. What I am going to do is try to make the best choices possible within prescribed limits.\n\nFor example, Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died, host an annual July 4 bash.\n\nThe buffet table is laid out with scores of delicious goodies. Hardly any of them are on those preferred food lists.\n\nSo this year, I went with a game plan. I decided in advance which foods I really wanted and which foods I could pass on.\n\nI measured out my pork and beans, grilled turkey and pulled pork, coleslaw and pickles wrapped in chipped beef and cream cheese.\n\nI left the chips and the dip behind along with the scalloped corn and cheesy potatoes.\n\nThe toughest passes were Mom 2.0’s delicious spritz and sugar cookies.\n\nOh, I could have had one, but I saved my sweet for the once-a-year treat of homemade pineapple sherbet.\n\nI ate a small meal at the end of the day of some leftover grilled turkey and a yellow tomato. I made sure I went for a swim.\n\nIt turned out I was about 150 calories under my goal for the day. My carbs were with in prescribed levels, though my fats were higher than I would want to see on most days. I blame the cream cheese.\n\nStill, I had a lovely meal with company of good friends and family. I was able to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI believe not considering it a “cheat day” prevented me from overeating and making myself miserable both physically, by overstuffing my stomach, and mentally, by feeling guilty for how much I ate.\n\nSo if you want my advice, don’t cheat, just eat within prescribed limits.\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 30, 2016\n\nNumbers game\n\nI haven’t written about my weight in a while, which seems odd given these paragraphs are about my ongoing efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nWhen I started this journey, that was the only number that mattered to me.\n\nHow I felt about myself and the entire journey rested on the number that flashed on the scale.\n\nIf I lost weight, I was good. If I gained, I was bad. My mood swung violently with each pound. Anxiety rattled me in advance of weigh-ins.\n\nBut I’ve been at this a while now. I’ve come to the realization my recovery and health is not measured by the scale.\n\nThis isn’t to say I’ve gained a bunch of weight. I don’t know. I haven’t been to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center, where I weigh in, since May.\n\nI’m not avoiding it. I’m just not that interested in the results.\n\nNo, I’m not giving up on the journey. I’m just measuring progress differently.\n\nInstead of body weight or even body composition, I’m looking at the things I can see with my own eyes.\n\nMy pants are baggy to the point of being clownish. Clothes in my closet that haven’t fit for years are comfortable again.\n\nI can even see the changes to my body. Oh, I’m still plenty lumpy. Yet skin sags where it was once filled with fat.\n\nI can feel muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders and chest.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other numbers.\n\nI can carry 35-pound kettle bells for 400 meters. A year ago, I whined when Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist, handed me 2-pound weights.\n\nI can press 120 pounds over my shoulders.\n\nA back that once couldn’t carry in groceries without injury can now withstand deadlifts of 230 pounds for four repetitions in six sets.\n\nI can row on a machine for 500 meters in less than two minutes.\n\nI can squat to my heels without losing my balance and I can do that with 125 pounds on my back.\n\nNate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay and my fitness coach, posts my progress on a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and my doctor, Shauna Basener, can see.\n\nI can see the differences in my body, from the thickness of my belly to my balance in the videos and pictures he posts.\n\nWhen I took to the pool this spring, I started doing the exercises Stefanie gave me last year. But they were too easy.\n\nSo I just decided to swim. I swim uninterrupted for 40 minutes. I get faster and stronger each week.\n\nMy muscle mass is increasing. I know this not because of a readout on a computer, but because it is easier for me to sink to the bottom of the pool.\n\nLast year, I couldn’t dive down to touch the bottom of the pool the entire season.\n\nThis year, I do it on every dive. I try to do a handstand on the pool.\n\nI’m getting ever closer to being able to do pushups off the floor.\n\nThe other day at the gym, I fell down. I lost my balance while trying to do front squats, an exercise where I hold a weight bar at my neck and bend into a catcher’s squat.\n\nI’ve seen it happen to the other athletes at Nate’s gym. They front squat a lot more weight than me. But everybody falls down.\n\nHere’s the difference for me: I got back up again and finished the rep.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, a fall might have sidelined me for the day.\n\nI used to get calf injuries with big knots on the muscle. Nate would roll them out with a special tool.\n\nI haven’t had that problem in a long time.\n\nI feel better. I am stronger.\n\nAm I done? Heavens no.\n\nThere is so much more to do.\n\nBut I am getting better about not letting the journey be about one number.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016\n\nJust one of the guys\n\nI looked at the red numbers on the dusty, old clock radio by my bedside. Monday morning had arrived. The workweek loomed.\n\nMy brain stalled. The chemicals that cause anxiety churned somewhere in the folded pink-gray mass inside my skull and a froth of panic bubbled.\n\nI tried to process the intense fight-or-flight response with intellect. I knew this was a chemical malfunction. There was no real reason to be this horrified by the new day.\n\nAll I needed was to swallow one of the greenish yellow pills. Fifteen minutes would pass. My heart rate would drop. I would be fine.\n\nBut I resisted. In retrospect, of course, I feel the fool. A close friend struggles with anxiety, too. She also takes prescription medication to control it.\n\nWhen the first pangs of an anxiety attack echo in her mind, I tell her to take a pill. Sometimes, she pauses. I remind her the medicine cannot work if you just think about taking it.\n\nOh, were I only so good at taking the advice I so smugly give.\n\nTime passed. I checked emails. I looked at the spate of paragraphs that needed stacking for the week. Yet the tightness in my chest remained. Anxiety gripped my heart in a clenched fist.\n\nAll I wanted in this world was to get back into bed and pull the sheets over my head. Today was too much. We’ll try again tomorrow.\n\nWhy didn’t I take the pill? I can’t explain that. Sometimes I believe I can out-think my anxiety. If I know what causes it, I can deactivate it.\n\nThis is a little bit like thinking you can disarm a bomb that’s already gone off.\n\nStill, I stubbornly hunkered down and tried to grit it out. As I said, it was foolhardy.\n\nI made breakfast, a piece of steak with some grilled tomatoes. Protein fills me up and gives me the energy I need for workouts with coach Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nI watched the clock. The time to go to the gym approached. My thinking cycled. My brain almost screamed at me: “Don’t go. Just stay home. You can’t handle this today.”\n\nThis line of thinking mixed with the usual self-deprecating thoughts that I’m a bad person, that I’m not smart enough for this job and soon the bosses will figure this out and fire me, and that I am simply unworthy of love.\n\nStill, I did not take the pill. I always think the anxiety will pass through my mind like a scattered thunderstorm. It never passes. It’s always a severe thunderstorm and sometimes it’s an EF5 tornado.\n\nI thought of Nate and the guys at the gym. I like them. I like being there the same way I liked being on sports teams as a boy. I’m there to lose weight and get fit, sure. But I have no illusions about being a competitive athlete.\n\n(Nate would argue with me on that point, but the difference of opinion really doesn’t matter. He’s helping me help myself get healthier. That’s the goal.)\n\nThe clock read 1 p.m. I was dressed for the gym. I was ready to go. But I did not want to go. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.\n\nI cannot say with precision what made me decide to go instead of stay. I worry about disappointing Nate. I worry about backsliding on my physical progress. I worry about letting worry control me.\n\nMaybe I went to the gym simply because of reflex action.\n\nAgain, it doesn’t really matter. I went. There is a small victory in that.\n\nI loosened up, but anxiety still swirled in my mind. Nate laid out the goals for the day. We did some squats without weight to loosen my quads.\n\nHe told me what the workout plan was. I was breathing hard. My heart hammered. It wasn’t the workout. It was the anxiety.\n\nNate told me to take a couple minutes before we went through the combination of metabolic conditioning and strength training.\n\nI went over and sat on a box in a dark corner of the gym. My hands shook.\n\nNate spotted me. He asked if I was dizzy or just getting mentally prepared for the workout. I confessed it was a bad day for anxiety.\n\nHe asked if the workouts helped. They do. Anticipation is the worst part of anything: workouts, getting together with my girlfriend, friends or family, or practically going anywhere or doing anything.\n\nMy workout started at the same time as another client doing something far more intense. I was working out for 16 minutes. The set was three burpees — an exercise that sounds like something cute you do with babies but is far less pleasant — with two weightlifting challenges and a walk.\n\nI made it through the first round and was about halfway into the second when I realized I couldn’t control my heart rate anymore.\n\nYes, the workout was getting my heart rate up. The problem was, it was already pounding from the anxiety. I stopped. I finally took the damn pill.\n\nI went back to the workout. I did the best I could. It wasn’t a wonderful performance. But I made almost four complete cycles in the allotted time.\n\nI was disappointed. Nate thought I was upset with the workout. I wasn’t. I was angry at myself for not taking the pill hours before instead of bullheadedly enduring this anxiety.\n\nI finished with a cool-down exercise on the rowing machine. By then, the medicine mixed with the endorphins released from the workout.\n\nCalm settled in, even a bit of whimsy. Nate and a couple of his other trainers had a break before their next client.\n\nWe went out in the parking lot and played catch beside the building. We talked about absolutely nothing important. It was wonderful.\n\nAnd there I was, just one of the guys.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 13, 2016\n\nHard rider\n\nCoach Nate Yoho divides my workouts at CrossFit Merle Hay into two segments.\n\nWe begin with a weightlifting exercise. Then we transition into met-con, or metabolic condition. This phase of the workout includes three or four activities, at least one of which is a cardio challenge mixed with more weightlifting reps.\n\nNate recently added five exercise bikes to his equipment inventory. I hate exercise bikes. They are uncomfortable for my big butt and often don’t adjust properly for someone ", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2024/04/03/lost-luggage-tips-policies-cruising-altitude/73027503007/", "title": "These are the most common lost luggage items | Cruising Altitude", "text": "Losing luggage is a nightmare scenario for many travelers. It could mean having to buy a whole new wardrobe or even parting with something near and dear to them.\n\nBut those lost items are sometimes given a second chapter thanks to Unclaimed Baggage, a store and e-commerce site that resells many items that vanish during travel.\n\n“Airlines really are great in reuniting lost luggage,” Sonni Hood, public relations manager at Unclaimed Baggage, told me. But, she said, “a fraction of a percent adds up quickly when you consider that millions of people fly every day.”\n\nThe store in Scottsboro, Alabama, said it introduces about 7,000 items to its shelves every day, and the online shopping portal sees about 5,000 new items each week.\n\nIn a new report that Unclaimed Baggage plans to release annually, the store details the most common items in lost bags for the year.\n\n“The different things that are happening in our culture eventually find their way into what people are packing in their suitcase,” Hood said.\n\nAccording to the Found Report, some of the most common items in 2023 were underwear, shoes and tablets/e-readers. (Sonni swore an oath that the store sells only unused underwear, so go forth with your shopping in peace.)\n\nShe also said lost luggage can teach you a lot about consumer trends. Lululemon is clearly having a moment – it’s one of the most popular brands in the store right now. Stanley cups also saw a spike in appearances in 2023, edging out Yetis and other thermos brands that were more popular in the past. Even electronics come and go in waves.\n\n“Last year we found hardly any DSs, (but) we found so many Nintendo Switches,” Hood said.\n\nThe report also details some of the more novel finds of 2023, including two live snakes, 19 Rolex watches, a jar full of shark teeth, and a Halloween card from the 1980s signed by President Richard Nixon.\n\nHow to avoid losing your bags when you travel\n\nHood said there are simple steps travelers can take to make it less likely they lose their stuff in the first place – or more likely they’re reunited with it if something goes wrong.\n\nHere are her essential tips:\n\nLabel your bag inside and out with your name and up-to-date contact information.\n\nRemove old stickers and bag tags from your checked luggage.\n\nMake your suitcase stand out on the carousel so someone doesn’t accidentally take it.\n\nPack all your essentials, like medicines, in your carry-on bag.\n\nAnd finally, don’t rush.\n\n“Whenever you’re getting off the plane, it’s so easy to leave your Kindle or a cellphone or your glasses in the seat,” Hood said. So take a second to really make sure you have everything with you before you depart.\n\nAs someone who once left his jacket in the overhead bin and then spent hours trying to find it at the lost and found in London Heathrow Airport, I agree.\n\nAs Hood said earlier, airlines are generally pretty good about reuniting passengers with lost items. I did get that jacket back, for example. Here’s the process at the four largest U.S. airlines if you lose something on your trip.\n\nAmerican Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nAmerican recommends filing a report with the airport or with the Transportation Security Administration if you know you lost your stuff on the ground. But if you lost it on an aircraft or in a lounge, or you’re not sure where along your journey you may have left your things, there’s a process for filing a claim through AA.\n\nAccording to American, once you file a claim, the airline will search for your items for up to 30 days. For lost baggage specifically, American requires you to make a report in person at the Baggage Services Office within four hours of landing. You'll also need to submit an online claim form and a checklist of the items when reporting a lost bag and requesting reimbursement for any of its contents.\n\nFor all other individual items, AA has an online claim form, accessible by clicking here.\n\nDelta Air Lines' lost luggage process\n\nDelta has online forms for lost, delayed or damaged bags and missing, nonchecked items that were lost on board, in a Delta lounge or in the gate area.\n\nAccording to the airline, it will search for lost bags for about 21 days, and 30 days for lost nonchecked items after receiving a report. The airline recommends being as detailed as possible in your missing-items report and filing the report within seven days of noticing the items are missing.\n\nUnited Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nUnited has an online claims process for lost luggage that hasn’t been found within five days of your arrival. The airline recommends going to the Baggage Service Airport if your luggage hasn’t arrived when you land or calling the Baggage Recovery Center if you’ve already left the airport. United requires passengers to report missing bags within 24 hours within the U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico and within seven days at international destinations.\n\nFor missing nonchecked items, United also has an online form.\n\nSouthwest Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nSouthwest requires passengers to file a report in person at the airport’s Baggage Service Offices if their bag does not arrive or to file an online report if they have already left the airport.\n\nSouthwest requires passengers to make their claim within four hours of arrival for a domestic flight and within seven days for an international itinerary.\n\nThe missing-bag claim form also has an option for missing nonchecked items.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

It made a lasting impression on my life.”\n\nRaised Baptist, Holmes never dared to read Islam’s most sacred text, and he lost track of the copy Ali gave him long ago. Yet for the 31 months since Ali’s death, Holmes has been one of the champ’s most devoted champions.\n\nHe started the petition drive that produced 14,000 signatures in favor of renaming Louisville’s airport after Ali, and he led a sometimes lonely fight with the mayor’s office and at airport authority meetings. He was growing resigned to defeat before his cause came off the mat Wednesday to score a decisive victory.\n\nBackground:Louisville is renaming its airport after Muhammad Ali\n\nLouisville Muhammad Ali International Airport might be a mouthful, but it is an enormous improvement on the former Standiford Field, named for a U.S. senator who died 16 years before the Wright Brothers went airborne. The new name links the city’s most prominent transportation hub with its most famous citizen, a man whose gravesite was adorned with a dozen roses Saturday morning — 11 red, one white.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject, how about rebranding the airport’s A & B concourses, “Butterfly” and “Bee?”\n\nAs Abe Lincoln once observed at a dedication ceremony, it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. Though Ali remains a polarizing figure, still anathema to some because of his conscientious objection to the Vietnam war, his resistance to the draft was ostensibly based on principle rather than dubious bone spurs.\n\nThat there are people who will condemn the former and condone the latter says something disturbing about racial politics and partisan hypocrisy in this country.\n\n“You can imagine the hatred and the vitriol that I received over time,” said Holmes, a 47-year-old educator at Noe Middle School. “My faith waned. I said it’s probably not going to happen during my lifetime. For me on a personal level, it showed that if I’m obedient to God, God can move mountains. He can do the heavy lifting.”\n\nMore:Your airport name is lame. It can't compete. Muhammad Ali can't be beat\n\nHolmes suspects the lifting became lighter after Greg Fischer won a third term as Louisville’s mayor, knowing he could not run for a fourth until after he had been out of office for four years.\n\n“The mayor was gearing up for a campaign,” Holmes said. “To touch on the Ali renaming would have been an extra bag for him to carry. Even in 2019, the idea of renaming the airport is not well-received by all Louisvillians.”\n\n\"Mayor (Fischer) had been looking for an appropriate way to honor Ali since his death,\" said Fischer's spokeswoman, Jean Porter. \"... (The) mayor is pleased that Mr. Holmes and so many others agree it's a great way to go.\"\n\nIf Fischer’s lame-duck agenda is more ambitious than were his previous platforms, it's fair to say his enthusiasm for Ali has been consistent and unequivocal. Moreover, the airport authority’s working group has been considering renaming the facility after Ali since at least November 2017.\n\nThese things don’t always happen quickly. Though airports in New York and California were rechristened within months of the deaths of John F. Kennedy and John Wayne, Chicago’s Orchard Depot Airport was not renamed after Butch O’Hare until six years after the Medal of Honor recipient was shot down in the Pacific theater. Louis Armstrong had been dead for 30 years before New Orleans changed its airport’s name to honor the great jazz trumpeter.\n\nRead this:5 things to know about Louisville's new airport name: Muhammad Ali\n\nAli’s aversion to air travel was so great that he had to be persuaded to participate in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Later, he reportedly traveled with his own personal parachute, betraying a level of fear in stark contrast to his trademark bravado.\n\nThough it is probably apocryphal, the story is told that Ali once boarded a plane without fastening his seat belt. Reminded to buckle up by the flight attendant, Ali responded, “Superman don’t need no seat belt.”\n\n“Superman,” the flight attendant replied, “don’t need no airplane.”\n\nTim Sullivan: 502-582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @TimSullivan714.

The cargo hold is pressurized and heated, he said.\n\n\"We are grateful that he did not sustain any injuries,'' Feinstein said.\n\nThis isn't the first time an airline employee has been stuck in the cargo hold during a flight. In January 2017, a baggage handler was trapped in cargo on a United Express flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Washington Dulles. He was unharmed.\n\nThe most high profile recent incident occurred in 2015, when an Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles had to turn around after pilots and passengers heard banging from beneath the aircraft shortly after takeoff.\n\nA baggage handler was stuck in the cargo hold. He called 911 and said he was trapped in the plane but the connection was lost.\n\nThe American baggage handler did not have a phone on the flight. Feinstein said cell phone use is prohibited on the airport ramp.\n\nBill Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, said being trapped in a cargo hold is probably \"pretty claustrophobic'' but overall not as risky as it sounds since the area is pressurized and temperature controlled. Besides bags and packages, many airlines carry animals in the cargo hold.\n\n\"Particularly if they have live animals traveling, they'll keep it on average between 60 and 70 (degrees),'' he said.\n\nWaldock counts as many as a dozen publicized incidents of airline workers becoming trapped in the cargo hold over the years, usually because someone fell asleep.\n\nHe said baggage handling is tiring work, with long shifts and heavy lifting.\n\n\"Every now and then they try to take naps because they're so tired,'' he said.\n\nWaldock said airlines generally have two or three baggage handlers per flight depending on the size of the plane, plus a baggage handling supervisor. The supervisor is charged with making sure employees are accounted for after bags and other cargo are loaded, he said.\n\n\"But sometimes they slip through the cracks,'' he said.\n\nA person familiar with the American incident in Kansas City but unauthorized to speak publicly about it said the napping employee was overlooked because no bags were loaded into the forward cargo hold and the door was closed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2023/12/14/flight-complaints-luggage-tracker-delays/71893640007/", "title": "How to complain about flights — and why you need a luggage tracker", "text": "It's time once again to prepare for maddening lines through security, stressed out passengers trying to stuff way too much into overhead bins, and unsettling flight delays as holiday travel hits crunch time.\n\nMany of us aren't just taking a holiday trip. We're still trying to somehow regain time lost with family and loved ones during the pandemic. It seems like money well spent in spite of the high cost of inflation and the reality that travel devours a great deal of cash. It doesn't hurt that Christmas falls on a Monday, as does New Year's Day.\n\nIf you're traveling now, though, it may be wise to pack some patience and prepare for potential headaches. Cancellations have improved but flight delays, mishandled luggage and damaged wheelchairs were worse during the first nine months of 2023 than the same time period a year earlier, based on the latest data available, according to a new report released Thursday by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund.\n\nConsumers also continued to have trouble getting refunds that they were owed when flights were canceled or discontinued.\n\n\"For the first five months of 2023, travelers filed 38,135 complaints against U.S. and foreign airlines, travel agents and tour operators. That’s up 68% from the same period last year,\" according to \"The Plane Truth,\" a detailed analysis by PIRG.\n\nDigging deeper into the numbers: PIRG noted that 26,312 of those complaints were against U.S. airlines, a 109% gain over the same period last year.\n\nThe consumer watchdog group anticipates that complaints against U.S. airlines will set new records in 2023.\n\nNo one, of course, wants to see anything close to the massive meltdown we witnessed at airports last holiday season when bags piled up at airports and people who should have been enjoying their vacations were stuck sleeping on the airport floor. More than 25,000 flights were canceled from Dec. 22 through Dec. 29, 2022. The culprits: a winter storm, little planning by many airlines to get ahead of the storm and major technology breakdowns at Southwest Airlines.\n\nAirlines are being watched this year\n\nOn the plus side, travelers during the Thanksgiving holiday didn't see a repeat of Christmas 2022.\n\nThis holiday, the airlines know that they've got reputations to rebuild — and Congress and the Department of Transportation are scrutinizing performance, according to Teresa Murray, who directs the Consumer Watchdog office for U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nEven so, Murray warns that planes are likely to be very crowded. The number of passengers is up 11% so far this year but the number of flights is up just 4%.\n\n\"That means more people on fewer flights,\" Murray said.\n\nAs a result, she said, you're more likely to be encouraged at the gate to check that carry-on bag. And you could even face being involuntarily bumped off your flight.\n\nDuring the last quarter, she said, 8,000 individuals were involuntarily bumped.\n\n\"It's not that much — unless you're one of them,\" Murray said.\n\nFor January through September 2023, the PIRG report noted, nearly 273,000 passengers were bumpedvoluntarily or involuntarily, up from about 10% or 248,000 passengers during the same period in 2022.\n\n\"Sure, some of the volunteers may not have minded much, especially if they received some compensation and their schedules weren’t disrupted much,\" the report stated. \"But the total shows the airlines collectively didn’t do as good of a job this year predicting how many passengers would show up.\"\n\nConsumers, though, apparently haven't been scared off by all those holiday travel horror stories from last year, the jammed flights, the crowds or rising complaints.\n\nAir travel set to break holiday records\n\nAir travel is expected to break a new record of 7.5 million passengers during the 10-day period from Dec. 23 through Jan. 1, according to forecasts from AAA. That would be 336,000 more passengers than last year.\n\nAAA estimates that 207,523 Michigan residents will board an airplane during that same time. That would be up from 199,882 last year.\n\nIn all, some 3.6 million Michiganders are expected to travel 50 miles or more from Dec. 23 through Jan. 1, the second highest holiday travel forecast since AAA began tracking in 2000. The busiest year was 2019 with 3.7 million Michigan travelers heading out by car, plane or other means of transportation.\n\nAverage plane ticket prices are lower than last year in many cases. According to AAA booking data, the average booking price for a roundtrip ticket to Orlando this holiday season is $613, down more than 16% from $735 last year. All roundtrip tickets to Orlando that AAA members booked, regardless of the departure city, were used for calculating that average price.\n\nAir travel overall showed a significant price drop as part of the latest consumer price index. Airline fares fell 12.1% year-over-year in November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The month-over-month drop was 0.4% from October through November.\n\nFlight cancellations have improved but delays are up\n\nUnfortunately, travel headaches remain part of the picture in 2023. Complaints against U.S. airlines more than doubled from January through May, compared with the same period last year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nNearly 35% of complaints during those five months involved flight cancellations, delays or missed connections, according to a review by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund.\n\nMurray noted that cancellations January through September dropped from 2.8% to 1.6%.\n\nWhile there are fewer cancellations, Murray said, airlines and the Department of Transportation need to do more work to make sure that the airlines engage in more realistic scheduling to avoid problems.\n\nDelayed flights remain a big concern. Murray noted that delays are slightly worse January through September. The largest airlines in 2022 had an on-time performance of 76.6%. This year, it is at 76.2%. Yet, she noted, that a level below 77% isn't good and it's been below 77% only one other time in the last 15 years, back in 2014.\n\n\"Delays are a bigger problem than in 2022, particularly when they cause passengers to miss connecting flights,\" according to the PIRG report released Thursday morning.\n\nThe PIRG report noted that more than 25% of flights arrived late this summer, by an average of 57 minutes, according to information from FlightAware.\n\nWhen you arrive nearly an hour late, you could miss a connecting flight — or possibly not arrive in time for an important meeting or family event.\n\nTroubles getting a refund made up an additional 20% of complaints, according to the PIRG analysis. Complaints about lost or damaged baggage or wheelchairs came in third, at nearly 16%of complaints. \"These percentages are similar to what we saw throughout 2022,\" PIRG noted.\n\nIt's discouraging to realize that the volume of complaints in 2023 left the Department of Transportation's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection so overwhelmed that data wasn't released on normal schedule. The batch of complaints through May, for example, was released more than three months late.\n\nPassengers need a game plan\n\nFollowing the old advice of getting to the airport early could matter more during the holidays, Murray said, especially if there is a risk that a flight is overbooked. The airlines, she said, aren't transparent about how they select the passengers to bump off a flight — and they do ask for volunteers first. But you could have a better shot at keeping your seat if you're at the gate on time.\n\nWhen it comes to carry-on luggage, it may be valuable to take time ahead of the flight to review the specific dimension of the bag that is allowed on a specific airline, as each can have different rules.\n\nOn the few flights I've been on this year, I've seen the airline encourage people to check their carry-on luggage at no fee at the gate and Murray says she's seen the same thing on trips she's taken.\n\nI also saw a passenger get argumentative at a Delta gate earlier in December because the attendants raised concerns and told him that his two carry-on pieces of luggage were too big to take on the plane. We're not sure how that one was resolved, but apparently it was as I saw the man when we were renting a car at our destination.\n\nOften, Murray said, the airline has a better shot at making an on-time arrival if more bags are checked, instead of carried onto the plane. You avoid the holdups that are triggered when those bags don't fit in overhead bins or there's no room left.\n\nMany times, though, passengers take a carry-on bag for a reason. They're bringing medication, carrying something valuable or taking electronic devices that they need when they arrive. Yet, it may not be the time to push the rules if you're trying to carry on an oversized bag.\n\n\"I wouldn't test the system,\" Murray said. \"I wouldn't try to get away with anything. It may not end well.\"\n\nTips for how to handle flight delays and issues\n\nHere are some key ways to protect yourself during holiday travel:\n\nMake sure to download an airline's app: The app can help you keep up with real-time notifications and communicate directly with customer service if needed. Murray advised that travelers don't just search online for an airline's contact information. Sadly, scammers set up imposter websites for customer service of big name companies. And you might end up connecting with scammers, not the real airline.\n\nPay attention to when you're booking a flight: Take a morning flight, if possible, and avoid connecting flights, which could be tough to catch if there are delays on the first flight.\n\nKeep records: Take a photo of what's in your checked baggage. Consumers are entitled to reimbursement up to $3,800 if your bag is lost. If you have expensive items, take photos of them and write down the model numbers, serial numbers, etc.\n\nChecked wheelchairs and scooters are considered baggage, but they’re not subject to the $3,800 liability limit, according to the Department of Transportation. Other “assistive devices” that are not subject to the $3,800 limit include walkers, CPAP machines, hearing aids and prescription medications.\n\nIf you agree to check a carry-on at the gate, make sure to take out your medication or small valuable items, say any car keys.\n\nBag trackers: It's increasingly popular to spend $20 to $30 or more on luggage tracking devices. The tracking devices, which are sold through a variety of retailers, can help you find your bags even when an airline cannot do so. Murray said this tip worked well for her when she faced a rescheduled flight due to weather in September.\n\nKnow when you're owed a full refund: A consumer is due a full refund under the law when an airline cancels or discontinues a scheduled flight for any reason. The airline has to issue the refund within seven days to a credit card or within 20 days if you paid by cash or check. The refund includes any baggage fees, seat fees and taxes. It's a good reason to book using a credit card, not a debit card.\n\nYou're owed that refund if the airline cancels the flight, even if you bought one of those nonrefundable lower priced tickets to save money. Ask the airline to rebook you at no extra cost or give you a refund.\n\nComplaints about refunds declined by nearly 12% during the first five months of 2023. But PIRG noted there were still nearly 6,000 complaints involving refunds. Far less than the nearly 90,000 refund complaints filed in all of 2020. \"But it’s unacceptable that there are any issues with refunds being issued promptly when a flight is canceled, especially when it’s the law,\" the report stated.\n\nMany times, you don't want a refund, you want to see Mom for Christmas.\n\nWhat's another possible solution for lengthy delays and canceled flights? Search online for a flight on another airline with available seats. If seats are available, you could ask your first airline to transfer your ticket to the second airline at no cost to you when the original airline knows of a significant delay. In such circumstances, PIRG says, a transfer of your ticket could be made at no cost to you.\n\nBut here's a clue: \"Airlines aren’t required to do this if the disruption wasn’t their fault, but many will if you ask nicely,\" according to PIRG. \"A transfer could save you a significant amount of money compared with buying a new ticket, because tickets often become more expensive closer to the departure date.\"\n\nAnother key tip: You have additional rights if your flight is canceled or significantly delayed for reasons within the airline’s control, such as staffing or equipment issues. Six of the 10 airlines will rebook you on another airline at no charge in cases where the cancellation was viewed as controllable, according the airline customer service dashboard provided online by the U.S. Department of Transportation. And five of the 10 will rebook at no additional cost on another airline when a significant delay was controllable.\n\nAll 10 made a commitment to pay for meals for passengers waiting three hours or more in these controllable cases. Most offer hotel accommodations in the case of overnight delays. \"You can’t count on the airline offering this to you unless you ask,\" PIRG warned.\n\nTake time to understand what airlines promised: The Department of Transportation has an online dashboard that lists what airlines promised to do to help families flying with young children and what they'll do when customers experience significant flight disruptions due to circumstances within the airline’s control. To learn more, see www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard for a checklist.\n\nWhere to complain: It's best to resolve issues with the airline first. Airlines have troubleshooters at the airports, often called customer service representatives, who take care of problems on the spot. But you can file a consumer complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation online at www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/file-consumer-complaint if the airline has not resolved the issue.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

For the latest news on Trump's hush money trial, follow our live updates for Thursday, May 2.\n\nNEW YORK — A lawyer who represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal testified Tuesday about his efforts to get her story of an affair with Donald Trump into the hands of the National Enquirer during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAttorney Keith Davidson, who had also represented porn star Stormy Daniels, texted the Enquirer's editor that he had \"a blockbuster story\" that the supermarket tabloid, which was backing Trump's first White House campaign, would want to purchase and suppress.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday at Trump's historic New York hush money trial, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was held in criminal contempt and fined $9,000 for violating a judge’s gag order. Trump, the first-ever former president to face criminal trial, is charged with doctoring business records to cover up the true purpose of reimbursements he made to his attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nThese were USA TODAY's live updates throughout the day:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump protests gag order ruling - and the trial itself\n\nAn angry Trump railed against the gag order ruling and again blamed President Joe Biden for his many legal problems.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,\" Trump told reporters at the courthouse after his trial concluded for the day. \"I'm supposed to be in Georgia. I'm supposed to be in New Hampshire ... and they have me sitting here for a Biden trial.\"\n\nThere is no evidence Biden has had anything to do with the hush money case in New York, which was brought by the Manhattan district attorney.\n\nTrump continued to attack Judge Juan Merchan, calling him \"conflicted\" and claiming he is \"rushing this case through.\"\n\nFor good measure, Trump also attacked the two judges in his previous civil cases, both of which he lost, and added that \"this is a corrupt system we're in.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nProceedings adjourned for day\n\nJudge Juan Merchan called an end to proceedings for the day. Trump exited the courtroom at 4:28 p.m. EST.\n\nThere will be a hearing Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. EST over whether Trump violated the judge's gag order another four times. Merchan already ruled earlier today Trump has violated it nine times. Merchan said he has allotted 30 minutes for that hearing, and asked the jurors to be ready at 10 a.m. EST on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson describes Cohen as 'highly excitable,' 'pants-on-fire' kind of guy\n\nDavidson was clearly frustrated with Michael Cohen in October of 2016, after Cohen missed the deadline to send the $130,000 hush money payment agreed to in the deal with Stormy Daniels. Asked by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass how he would describe Cohen, Davidson said he was a \"highly excitable,\" \"pants-on-fire\" kind of guy.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson re-sent money wiring instructions to Cohen\n\nDavidson said he re-sent instruction to Cohen for wiring the Stormy Daniels hush money in late October because of Cohen's \"repeated assertion\" he didn't have them, despite the fact that they were previously sent.\n\nCohen then forwarded an Oct. 26, 2016 email from his Trump Organization email address with \"First Republic Bank Transfer.\"\n\nThe email didn't mean anything to Davidson, he said. Cohen had his wiring instructions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump TIME interview: 'It always depends on the fairness of an election'\n\nIn an exclusive interview with TIME magazine published Tuesday, Trump provided one of his most in-depth descriptions yet of what a possible second term could look like.\n\nHis agenda would be staunchly conservative, telling TIME he wants to focus on deporting undocumented immigrants, deploying the National Guard to stop protests, and getting Europe to pay their share for international alliances.\n\nAmid standout moments from the April interview, Trump did not dismiss the possibility of violence around the 2024 election in light of the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection. He also signaled that Florida's 6-week abortion ban is \"too severe,\" but largely stuck with his recent stance that abortion regulation should be up to states.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nNational Enquirer editor indicated Trump's frugality could be downfall, per text\n\nAfter Davidson warned National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard a mess could unfold for Trump when the $130,000 hush money deal with Stormy Daniels appeared to fall through, Howard responded: \"All because trump is tight\"\n\nThat's according to Oct. 18, 2016 text messages shown to the jury. Davidson said he interpreted Howard's text to mean Trump is frugal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson believed Daniels would go public after $130,000 wasn't paid\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Stormy Daniels was going to go public with her story of having sex with Trump, potentially with multiple media outlets, after the Trump team failed to pay the $130,000 settlement.\n\nDavidson was explaining a text he sent to National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard on Oct. 18, 2016. He texted: \"I can't believe Cohen let this go,\" he said referring to Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDonald Trump not present in courtroom – despite earlier reproach from judge\n\nThe judge returned and proceedings were officially announced to restart after a short court break, but Trump and his lawyers still weren't in the courtroom. They entered a couple minutes later. It's unclear if they were actually late.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan earlier chided Trump's defense team about returning to the courtroom on time. However, Merchan didn't make any comment once they did return just now. Merchan has just called for the jury to be brought into the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt takes short break\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced a short afternoon break in proceedings. The trial teams have exited the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Goddammit, I'll just do it myself': Cohen allegedly said he'd make $130,000 payment\n\nDavidson testified he communicated to former Trump attorney Cohen that the level of dissatisfaction was \"quite high\" after they hadn't been paid the $130,000 agreed to in the hush money deal. Remember, Davidson represented Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\"Goddammit, I'll just do it myself,\" Cohen responded, according to Davidson. He said he interpreted that to mean that, although the deal was already \"consummated\" with a signature, Cohen wouldn't seek authority in order to provide the funding.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWitness complained Michael Cohen was late on Stormy Daniels hush money payment\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass is now asking Davidson about complaints he made to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in 2016 that the deadline to pay the $130,000 settlement in the hush money deal had passed without payment.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWitness says Michael Cohen demanded only he keep document identifying parties to hush money deal\n\nDavidson testified that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen demanded that only he keep a copy of a document labeled a \"side letter agreement.\" According to an email from Davidson that was shown to the jury, the side letter agreement identified the parties to the hush money deal. The deal was worth $130,000, according to the email.\n\nDavidson also testified about using pseudonyms for Daniels and Trump in the deal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWitness peeks at jurors during Trump hush money trial testimony\n\nDespite providing testimony that he may sometimes find embarrassing – he referred to women as the \"estrogen mafia\" in a text message shown earlier – Davidson is showing a lot of ease and comfort as his time on the stand goes on. He is sometimes looking directly at jurors as he's testifying. They are to Davidson's left, while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is asking him questions from slightly to his right.\n\nWhile witnesses who aren't used to a courtroom will often just look at the person asking them questions, seasoned trial witnesses as well as lawyers are more prone to look directly at jurors. That can be motivated by a desire to build trust.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is AMI?\n\nAmerican Media Inc. (AMI) is the parent company of the publication National Enquirer.\n\nFormer AMI CEO and president David Pecker was the first witness called in the trial. He testified that he attempted to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign by publishing positive stories about the president and stopping negative ones from getting out.\n\nNational Enquirer bought Karen McDougal's life story but refused to pay for Stormy Daniels', Pecker said on the stand.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nCan you watch Trump's hush money trial?\n\nNo, the trial won't be televised or available to watch online or aired on TV.\n\nNew York court rules state that audio-visual coverage of trials is not permitted unless a representative of the news media submits an application and the judge allows it.\n\nRecords show an application was submitted to cover the arraignment, but not the trial. Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request to televise the arraignment.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Wave the white flag,' National Enquirer editor texted after 'Access Hollywood' tape\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass introduced yet another piece of evidence supporting the prosecution's story of a scheme involving the National Enquirer to help Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nKeith Davidson, who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money deals ahead of the election, texted National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard after the Access Hollywood tape's release, saying Trump would not win the election and using a vulgar term.\n\n\"Wave the white flag. It's over people!\" Howard texted back.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAccess Hollywood tape created 'crescendo' of interest in Stormy Daniel's story\n\nDavidson said the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape had \"tremendous\" importance when it came to interest in porn star Stormy Daniels' story of an affair with Donald Trump. The tape, which hit the media about a month before Election Day in 2016, recorded Trump saying he kisses women without waiting and grabs their genitals.\n\n\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that the interest sort of reached a crescendo,\" Davidson testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'TheDirty.com' post in 2011 on Trump-Daniels affair removed after lawyer's letter\n\nKeith Davidson testified he sent a cease-and-desist letter in 2011 to a blog, \"TheDirty.com,\" after it posted a story saying porn star Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump had \"some sort of\" physical or romantic interaction.\n\nTrump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, called Davidson angrily after the post was up, Davidson testified. Davidson said Cohen believed Daniels was behind the blog post, but Davidson told him Daniels didn't want the story published. After Davidson's letter to the blog, the post was taken down, he said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson testimony shifts to Stormy Daniels\n\nKeith Davidson's testimony is shifting to porn star Stormy Daniels, whom he also represented in a hush money deal ahead of the 2016 election. Davidson confirmed he represented her as early as 2011.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nKaren McDougal signed hush money deal three months before 2016 election\n\nKaren McDougal signed her hush money deal on August 6, 2016, according to a document shown to the jury. The effective date for the contract was August 5, 2016. It was about three months before Election Day.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson says Trump is the reason he called Michael Cohen on Karen McDougal hush money deal\n\nDavidson has resumed his testimony after the lunch break and is going over McDougal's deal with prosecutor Joshua Steinglass.\n\nDavidson said he called Michael Cohen as a professional courtesy because a deal involving Cohen's client had closed.\n\nAsked by Steinglass what client that was, Davidson responded: \"Donald Trump.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump complies with judge's order to remove offending social media posts\n\nTrump's Truth Social account has removed posts that Judge Juan Merchan ruled earlier Tuesday were in violation of his gag order.\n\nThe former president had faced a 2:15 p.m., deadline, lest he face the possibility of a contempt citation and jail.\n\nSome of the flagged posts involved a key witness in the hush money trial, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Other posts includes attacks on potential jurors, other witnesses, prosecutors, and the judge.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nNo trial proceedings on May 24 due to juror conflict\n\nEarlier today, Merchan said there won't be trial proceedings on Friday, May 24, because a juror has a plane flight that day ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.\n\nMerchan announced that cancellation after stating earlier that there will be a day off May 17 so that Donald Trump can attend his youngest son Barron Trump's high school graduation. Merchan said he may also cancel June 3 proceedings at the defense's request - at least if jury deliberations aren't going on by then.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrial teams arrive in courtroom for afternoon proceedings\n\nTrump and his defense team returned to the courtroom for afternoon proceedings around 2:13 p.m. EST, followed soon after by the prosecution team.

Although transcripts of proceedings aren't always available, officials decided to post official copies online due to the \"unparalleled public interest.\"\n\nYou can access all the transcripts and evidence from week two on the New York court system's media website. Documents from each day in court this week will be posted by the end of the following business day.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump's hush money trial breaks for lunch\n\nDonald Trump exited the courtroom at about 12:59 p.m. EST after Judge Juan Merchan announced a lunch break. The prosecution team is preparing to exit as well.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking Isle of Mann'\n\nAccording to messages shown to the jury, as Davidson was negotiating a deal to keep McDougal's story of an affair with Trump quiet ahead of the 2016 election, National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard texted Davidson: \"We are going to lay it on thick for her.\"\n\n\"Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking Isle of Mann,\" Davidson responded.\n\nDavidson described it as a joke. He confirmed to prosecutor Joshua Steinglass that he understood the hush money deal would benefit Trump's campaign.\n\n–Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Trump trial Day 6 recap: National Enquirer's David Pecker testifies on killing stories\n\n'The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia'\n\nDavidson was asked about a text message he sent when he was negotiating a deal with the National Enquirer's parent company to pay McDougal for her story. Davidson texted: \"Don't forget about Cohen. Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia.\"\n\nDavidson, forced to explain that comment on the witness stand, described his text as \"very unfortunate\" and \"regrettable.\" He said he thought \"the estrogen mafia\" was a term he'd adopted from one of McDougal's associates. He said there were several women leaning on McDougal to sign a deal with ABC News.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n\"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why...\"\n\nWhen former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard heard that Keith Davidson had a \"blockbuster trump story,\" Howard responded: \"Talk 1st thing. I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why...\"\n\nThat's according to text messages shown to the jury.\n\nWhat did Howard mean when he said Davidson knew why Howard would get Davidson more than anyone else for the story? Davidson told jurors there was an at least implicit awareness that the parent company of the National Enquirer had endorsed Trump's 2016 presidential run.\n\nFor that reason, the tabloid would want to keep the story quiet, Davidson's comment seemed to suggest.\n\nThe blockbuster story was McDougal's account of a sexual affair with Trump, Davidson testified. He said he couldn't specifically recall how long the alleged affair lasted, and that it could have been several weeks to months, \"if not more.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I have a blockbuster Trump story'\n\nThe jurors were shown a 2016 text message from Keith Davidson to Dylan Howard, the former editor in chief of the National Enquirer.\n\n\"I have a blockbuster Trump story,\" Davidson told Howard, setting the stage for a \"catch and kill\" purchase of the rights to her account of a purported affair with the reality TV star and presidential candidate.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson hired to represent McDougal on claims against Trump and press opportunities\n\nDavidson and prosecutor Joshua Steinglass just reviewed a paragraph from Davidson's legal retainer agreement with Karen McDougal on the scope of his services for her.\n\nThe agreement said he was hired to represent McDougal when it came to her claims against Donald Trump \"and/or\" several other potential services tied to her interaction with Trump: Negotiating a confidentiality agreement, handling the rights to her story, and negotiating the assignment of exclusive press opportunities.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Debunking misinformation about Stormy Daniels amid Trump hush money trial | Fact check\n\nDavidson describes working with Karen McDougal\n\nDavidson said he met former playboy model Karen McDougal about 25 years ago, when she was dating a friend of his.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is asking Davidson introductory questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels and what is her real name?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels says she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMore:National Enquirer editor said Stormy Daniels' affair story was true: Texts shown to jury\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nCohen funneled the money through the National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nShe has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\nThompson testimony ends after brief questioning on Truth Social, Access Hollywood tape\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Mangold reviewed a few portions of a 2022 deposition of Trump with Thompson. The portions touched on Trump social media platform Truth Social, Melania Trump, and the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Trump crudely described kissing and groping women.\n\nThose details about the tape weren't described. That may be something that comes later in the trial. The judge has ruled the tape can't be played to the jury, but details about it can be shared.\n\nTrump's defense team didn't have any questions for Thompson.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt reporting company employee begins testimony\n\nC-SPAN archives executive director Robert Browning concluded his brief testimony, which was used to bring in video clips of Trump. Phillip Thompson, who works for national court reporting company Esquire Deposition Solutions, is now testifying.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nVideos show Trump denying women's claims\n\nVideo clips of Donald Trump speaking were introduced into evidence as prosecutor Rebecca Mangold questioned Robert Browning, including one clip from Oct. 22, 2016, and another from Jan. 11, 2017. Mangold played passages for the jury of Trump denying different women's claims about him − though the videos didn't make clear what allegations he was denying.\n\n\"I have no idea who these women are,\" Trump said in one clip.\n\nTrump also said:\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up. They never happened.\"\n\n\"Fortunately we have the microphone.\"\n\n\"These are lies being pushed by the media and the Clinton campaign.\"\n\n\"I don't know who these people are.\"\n\nTrump also said he's been advised not to talk about it, but he feels he has to. And he said claims about him were completely \"fabricated.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nEvidence that Trump had a guilty mind can't come in, judge rules. Other evidence permitted\n\nBefore Browning, the C-SPAN executive, began his testimony, Judge Merchan ruled that prosecutors may not bring in evidence designed to show Trump was exhibiting consciousness of his own guilt. The prosecution argued Trump's defense team opened the door to that alleged evidence during opening statements.\n\nHowever, Merchan said prosecutors may introduce evidence designed to:\n\nOffset the defense's claim that Daniels and Cohen are benefiting from their willingness to testify, and\n\nExplain why Daniels and Cohen both initially denied certain facts.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nC-SPAN executive called to testify\n\nThe prosecution has called Robert Browning, an executive director of C-SPAN's archives to the stand. He said he has never testified in a legal proceeding before and confesses he's a little nervous. Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold is asking him questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nEvidence of Trump attacks on Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen? Judge to rule on what jury can hear\n\nBefore a short court break, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued that Trump's defense lawyers opened the door to evidence of his attacks on porn star Stormy Daniels and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen through comments they made during opening statements. Colangelo noted in particular a comment about Daniels benefiting from the case through a book and a documentary.\n\nColangelo said his team wants to show, for example, how Trump's public statements about Cohen changed after Cohen started cooperating with prosecutors, with Trump earlier saying Cohen wasn't the type of person to flip, but afterwards attacking him. They also want to present evidence that Daniels' and Cohen's cooperation with law enforcement has harmed them more than it's helped them.\n\nThe prosecutor said evidence should be allowed in for three separate purposes:\n\nTo offset the defense's claim that Daniels and Cohen are benefiting from their willingness to testify;\n\nTo explain why Daniels and Cohen both initially denied certain facts; and\n\nTo show Trump was exhibiting consciousness of his own guilt.\n\nTrump defense lawyer Todd Blanche pushed back, saying Trump wasn't showing consciousness of guilt about the indictment in this case when he was speaking about Cohen in relation to crimes Trump was never charged with. The risk that the jury will hear that and use it for an improper purpose \"is huge,\" Blanche said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump defense opened the door to potentially damaging testimony, prosecutor says\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo is now arguing Trump's defense team opened the door in their opening statement to prosecutors bringing in broader evidence and testimony than Judge Merchan previously authorized. The judge has announced a short break.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Shady stuff' text message: Will the jury see it?\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass and defense lawyer Todd Blanche made arguments to Judge Juan Merchan over whether potential evidence might prejudice the jury against Trump. Steinglass argued prosecutors should be able to show certain text messages to the jury that the defense wants kept out of the trial. One text, according to Blanche, said certain \"shady (stuff) is going on.\"\n\nMerchan said he will rule on the issue after a court break.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCohen banker Gary Farro's testimony concludes\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche ended his cross-examination of Farro, and after very brief further questioning by the prosecution and defense, Farro was allowed to leave the witness stand.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer laying groundwork for claiming Trump was ignorant?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche got banker Gary Farro to confirm that nothing about how an account Michael Cohen opened in October of 2016 raised a red flag for Farro. Blanche also got Farro to confirm he has never spoken with Donald Trump himself.\n\nThat may be groundwork for the defense team to later argue to the jury that the banker saw no red flags at the time, so why would Trump?\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFarro says he wouldn't have knowingly assisted with shell company for Cohen\n\nFarro testified that, if a client said he was opening a shell company that didn't have a business behind it, Farro generally wouldn't have assisted the client. The exception he noted is an LLC for owning a home or yacht or air craft, where the purpose of the LLC would be to maintain anonymity since a mortgage would become a public record.\n\nProsecutors say the LLC Michael Cohen opened in October of 2016 was a shell company for wiring hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump condemns college protestors; defends people involved in Jan. 6\n\nIn pre-trial remarks this morning, Trump combined his attacks on the Israel-Hamas protesters at colleges with sympathy for the pro-Trump rioters of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe former president questioned whether the kinds of protesters who took over a building at Columba University will be prosecuted like the Jan. 6 defendants have been.\n\n\"I wonder if that's going to the the same kind of treatment they gave J6,\" Trump said.\n\nIn a Time magazine interview published earlier in the day, Trump again said he would consider pardons for J6 defendants.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nFarro says Cohen's claims about new LLC didn't raise alarm bells\n\nGary Farro testified that Michael Cohen's explanation for why he was opening a new LLC didn't raise alarm bells for Farro. Cohen said he was opening the LLC to collect fees for investment consulting work he did for real estate deals, according to a document shown in court.\n\nProsecutors say the real purpose of the LLC was to wire $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels, to keep her story of having sex with Trump quiet in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFarro confirms Michael Cohen can be \"aggressive guy\"\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche asked Farro if he believes Michael Cohen is an \"aggressive guy,\" a \"fast speaker,\" and someone who's not easy to work with if you can't convey that not everything can get done as quickly as the client wants. Farro confirmed he thought that was fair to say.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche begins cross-examining Cohen banker\n\nTrump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has begun cross-examining Michael Cohen's 2016 banker, Gary Farro.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPorn star money transfer might not have been approved by bank, Farro testifies\n\nGary Farro, Michael Cohen's banker in 2016, said if Cohen had indicated his wire transfer was a payment to an adult film star, there would \"definitely\" have been \"enhanced due diligence\" by the bank. Farro added that a porn star's involvement would \"certainly\" have delayed the transaction,\" and it's possible the bank wouldn't have approved the wire transfer at all out of reputation concerns.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCohen gained advantage by not indicating money transfer was for political candidate, Farro testifies\n\nGary Farro, Michael Cohen's banker in 2016, testified that all money wire transfers had to be approved by the bank, and the bank's process would have been different if Cohen had indicated he was transferring money on behalf of a political candidate. There would have been additional due diligence issues that could have delayed things, Farro said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMichael Cohen asked to transfer $131,000, according to documents\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Mangold is taking Gary Farro through documents showing Michael Cohen sought $131,000 from a home equity line of credit, and to have the money transferred.\n\nThe details match allegations prosecutors made in an early \"statement of facts\" in the case, where they alleged Cohen opened a bank account in Manhattan in the name of a shell company that was created to send porn star Stormy Daniels hush money. Cohen transferred $131,000 from his personal home equity line of credit into the bank account, and then wired $130,000 to Daniels' lawyer, according to the allegations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump can attend son Barron Trump's high school graduation, judge says\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said former President Donald Trump will be able to attend his son Barron's high school graduation on May 17th. The judge noted the jury was picked pretty quickly in the trial.\n\nThe judge also addressed a request from the defense for a day off on June 3rd, saying if the jury is deliberating at that point, there could be a challenge, but if they're not deliberating, he thought that would be fine as well.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n2016 banker for Michael Cohen, Gary Farro, testifying\n\nGary Farro, who was Michael Cohen's banker in 2016, is testifying. Farro began his testimony on Friday. Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold is asking him to confirm details in documents about Cohen setting up a limited liability company, ESSENTIAL CONSULTANTS LLC.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump violated gag order nine times, judge rules\n\nJudge Merchan said he has determined Trump violated a gag order in the case nine out of ten times alleged by the prosecution. Trump will be fined $1,000 for each violation. The judge said he is issuing a written decision that will provide more details.\n\nThe prosecution has alleged Trump violated the gag order another four times, in addition to those earlier allegations, that weren't addressed by the judge. There will be a hearing later this week to address those allegations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump: I'd rather be in Georgia\n\nDonald Trump ran down a list of issues in brief comments to reporters before entering the courtroom.\n\nHe criticized the Israel-Hamas protests at Columbia University and other colleges, complained about the temperature in the courtroom \"icebox,\" and again lamented that he cannot be on the campaign trail while he is sitting in court.\n\n\"I'd much rather be in Georgia,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also urged listeners to look at his interview in Time magazine in which he outlined his plans for another term in the White House. Trump also again criticized the judge and the hush money case in general.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump enters the courtroom with son, Eric\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom for Day 9 of his criminal trial at 9:26 a.m. EST. His entrance brought something new today: a Trump family member. Eric Trump is standing in the front bench behind Trump's defense table.

Prosecutors say Trump falsely labeled the purpose of checks to Michael Cohen in order to cover up a conspiracy to unlawfully interfere with the 2016 presidential election. They say a $130,000 hush money payment from Cohen to porn star Stormy Daniels was authorized by Trump and violated federal campaign finance laws.\n\nDaniels has claimed she and Trump had sex in 2006, while the two were discussing Trump potentially casting her on a version of his TV show, \"The Apprentice.\" Trump denies her claim, and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Gary Farro?\n\nGary Farro, who began testifying on Friday, is a banker. He said he was assigned Michael Cohen as a client in 2015, when he was a senior managing director at First Republic Bank.\n\nIn October of 2016, Cohen asked Farro to help him open an account \"immediately\" for a new limited liability company, according to Farro's Friday testimony. Prosecutors have alleged Cohen opened a bank account that month in the name of a shell company he created in order to pay Daniels the $130,000 hush money.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty?\n\nTrump could theoretically face decades in prison if convicted on all counts, although most experts say that's highly unlikely. Instead, he's probably facing a sentence that ranges from merely probation to some jail or prison time that wouldn't exceed four years, according to several legal expects who spoke to USA TODAY.– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/23/donald-trump-judge-juan-merchan-gag-order/73418051007/", "title": "Judge weighs gag order fines in Trump hush money trial", "text": "Prosecutors urged Judge Merchan to fine Trump $3,000 for three alleged violations of his gag order against commenting on potential witnesses.\n\nTrump has argued he has a First Amendment right to deny the charges and criticize the case against him.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan will hear arguments Tuesday about whether to punish former President Donald Trump for alleged violations of his gag order by commenting on witnesses expected at his New York hush money trial.\n\nProsecutors asked Merchan on April 15 to fine Trump $3,000 for three alleged violations of his gag order in the case with social media posts criticizing potential witnesses in the case, former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nBy Thursday, prosecutors counted seven more alleged violations. And on Monday, Trump blasted Cohen again in a speech to reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom.\n\n“He got caught lying,” Trump said of Cohen. “Pure lying.”\n\nTrump has been fined for violating gag orders before\n\nMerchan scheduled a hearing Tuesday for prosecutors to urge him to find Trump in contempt and fine him.

While the fines are tiny for a billionaire, if Merchan feels he is violating the order flagrantly and repeatedly, the penalties for contempt of court could eventually escalate to putting Trump behind bars before the jury renders a verdict in his case.\n\nTrump promoted the drama in a fundraising email Monday, proclaiming \"all hell breaks loose\" with the hearing on the gag order and an all-caps warning. \"I could be thrown in jail at that very moment!\" said the message from Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nMerchan initially ordered Trump not to comment on potential witnesses or court staffers, which was similar to orders in Trump’s civil fraud trial and for his federal election interference charges.\n\nMerchan expanded the order when Trump commented on the judge’s daughter in arguing Merchan should be removed from the case. Merchan refused to withdraw.\n\nTrump blasts Cohen and Stormy Daniels on social media\n\nTrump has continued to blast Cohen and Daniels on social media, two witnesses at the heart of the case.\n\nCohen has testified he paid Daniels $130,000 to remain silent before the 2016 election about her claim she had sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to hide his reimbursement of Cohen. Trump has argued he was paying Cohen a legal retainer and wasn’t aware of the payment to Daniels, but Cohen says there was no retainer.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty and was imprisoned for charges including a campaign finance violation based on the payment to Daniels. He also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump real estate project in Moscow, so Trump has called him a liar for years. Ironically, that lie was told to protect Trump.\n\nTrump attacks Cohen's credibility\n\nOutside the courtroom Monday, Trump said Cohen “wasn’t very good” at being a lawyer and added: “The things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me.\"\n\nWhile testifying at Trump’s civil fraud trial last year, Cohen denied committing tax evasion despite having pleaded guilty to it. In trying to get released early from prison, Cohen acknowledged giving his lawyer arguments with fake legal citations generated by artificial intelligence.\n\n“When are they going to look at all the lies that Cohen did in the last trial?” Trump asked. “He got caught lying in the last trial.”\n\nProsecutors initially asked Merchan to fine Trump for three social media posts because of concern he could intimidate witnesses from testifying. Examples included on April 13, when Trump asked whether Cohen was “prosecuted for LYING?” A judge had ruled Cohen wouldn't be penalized.

What does that actually mean?", "text": "Judge Juan Merchan held former President Donald Trump in contempt of court Tuesday for nine gag order violations in his New York hush money trial. He now faces a $9,000 fine and potential jail time if there are future gag order violations.\n\nMerchan originally issued the gag order in March to protect potential witnesses, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels and jurors, from inflammatory statements that the former president has been known to make in other trials. The restriction included commenting on court staff, prosecution lawyers, and their families.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has experienced gag orders, and he is expected to have another hearing for them on May 2, but what are they, and what do they mean?\n\nMore:What is criminal contempt? Explaining the new charges facing Trump\n\nWhat is a gag order?\n\nGag orders are restrictions on what preliminary information about a trial can be released to the public and, in some instances, limits on what participants in a trial can say about it, when they can say it, and who they say it to. They are one tool used by judges to protect against trial interference.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThese orders are rarely used for individuals in trials, but they are most commonly seen in high-profile criminal trials like Trump's. In his most recent slew of gag order violations, the former president went against the judge's orders by attacking witnesses and the jury in the trial through posts on the social media site Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nAre they constitutional?\n\nSome see gag orders as a violation of First Amendment rights, but they are considered constitutional to help protect the right to a fair trial if they meet guidelines laid out by a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court case. Gag orders can be placed on media or trial participants if there is a lot of publicity around the case, there aren't any other routes to control pretrial publicity, and if they can prevent the publicity from reaching potential jurors.\n\nWhat happens if a gag order is violated?\n\nWhen gag orders are violated, they are treated as contempt of court. In these cases, judges can issue fines and, in some instances, prison time. The consequences of being held in contempt can vary depending on the state where a trial is held and whether the case is civil or criminal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/15/donald-trump-trial-new-york-live-updates/73308381007/", "title": "Trump trial Day 1 recap: How the hush money case kicked off", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from Donald Trump's trial from Monday, April 15. For the latest news on theTrump trial, follow our live updates for Thursday, April 18.\n\nNEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump's historic New York criminal trial for allegedly falsifying business records to disguise a hush money payment to a porn star and unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election started Monday.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces 34 felony counts that each carry a maximum sentence of four years, although New York law caps such sentences at 20 years. If he is convicted, many legal experts have said a realistic sentence ranges from probation to four years in prison, although Trump would likely remain free on appeal during the duration of the presidential election.\n\nThe trial is the first of its kind. No former American president has ever been criminally indicted, although former President Richard Nixon may have faced that prospect if his former vice president, Gerald Ford, hadn't pardoned him.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courthouse:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump trial live updates:Will we get 12 jurors on Day 3? Jury selection continues today.\n\nDay 1 of Trump New York hush money trial ends\n\nJudge Juan Merchan declared the close of proceedings Monday in the first criminal trial against a former U.S. president as a colorful pattern of potential jurors emerged.\n\nDiverse interests in prospective jury pool\n\nMany jurors were excused straight away when they indicated they couldn't be fair or impartial in the case, or couldn't participate for some other reason such as a scheduling conflict. But as individualized jury questioning got underway, remaining potential jurors described varied jobs, hobbies, and family lives.\n\nThey described working as a prosecutor, a bookseller, a nurse, a creative director, and getting their news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and a host of other outlets including USA TODAY and Fox News.\n\nSome liked hiking, others cooking. One, who was later excused, said she likes to \"go to the club.\"\n\nJury selection didn't begin until the afternoon, after the judge and lawyers handled procedural legal issues.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDismissed juror speaks\n\nA man, who declined to give his name, walked out of criminal court with his jury identification in his pocket. His name was crossed out.He said the judge dismissed him from jury selection because his daughter had a wedding in early June in Seattle.He didn’t have to answer any questions for the selection, but he believed Trump could get a fair trial.“His challenge is that he's a public figure and there's a ton of information already,” he said.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nJudge rejects Trump's request to be excused for Supreme Court immunity arguments\n\nAfter jurors were excused at the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump lawyer Todd Blanche to excuse the former president from the trial on April 25 so he can attend Supreme Court oral arguments in his criminal federal election interference case. The high court is reviewing whether Trump is immune from prosecution for official acts during his presidency.\n\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal,\" Merchan said, adding that he can very much understand why Trump would want to be there. However, Merchan said he wouldn't alter the plans for the criminal case on that basis.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price plummets Monday\n\nWhile Trump was in court Monday, his Trump Media & Technology Group shares plummeted more than 18% after the company took steps to sell millions of additional shares.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, filed to register up to 146.1 million shares for sale, including nearly 115 million owned by Trump personally. The company also listed the potential sale of another 21.5 million shares linked to warrants – contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price within a certain time frame.\n\nTrump Media’s market cap and Trump’s net worth – both tied to the company’s stock – have taken a hit as its stock price has dipped. The company’s market value as of Monday was more than $3.5 billion, down from a peak of nearly $8 billion.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nTrump glares at reporter who said he appeared to be sleeping in court\n\nAs Trump walked out of the courtroom during a short break in the afternoon's proceedings, he glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds. Haberman reported earlier in the day that Trump appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom. She said she saw his head drop down repeatedly and his mouth go slack.\n\nHaberman has reported on Trump for years and wrote a 2022 book about him titled, \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIndividual jury questioning begins\n\nIndividualized questioning of potential jurors has begun as the New Yorkers orally respond to 42 jury questions Judge Juan Merchan decided on before trial.\n\nA young woman is the first to respond orally to each item from the questionnaire, which she is reading silently. Donald Trump appears to be reading the questions silently at the table as he listens to the responses.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore than half of first-round potential Trump jurors say they can't be impartial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan excused at least 50 potential jurors from a group he earlier said included 96 New Yorkers because they indicated they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case. A handful of the potential jurors were wearing masks.\n\nAt least nine more potential jurors were excused after they indicated they couldn't serve for other reasons that weren't disclosed, leaving about 34 potential jurors.\n\nIt was a speedy whittling-down of the first group of potential jurors to be sworn in as former President Donald Trump goes on trial over whether he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge instructs potential jurors on being fair\n\nJudge Juan Merchan told prospective jurors that fair jurors will remain impartial and will guard against various stereotypes, asking themselves if their views on the defendant would be different if the defendant had a different political affiliation, among other attributes.\n\nMerchan also explained that the jurors are the judges of the facts in the case, while Merchan's job is to judge and instruct them on the law.\n\nDonald Trump has largely been looking at Merchan while the judge addresses the potential jurors, but he has occasionally looked at the jury box where some prospective jurors are sitting.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors are sworn in as judge begins opening remarks\n\nAt 2:34 p.m. ET, the first batch of potential jurors was sworn in. Judge Juan Merchan instructed the jury about the case and introduced the lawyers as well as Donald Trump. Both sides, including Trump, stood up after they were introduced and turned to face the potential jurors.\n\nMerchan gave the New Yorkers a brief description of the charges Trump faces. Merchan explained that the jury will have 12 jurors, and there will also be alternate jurors who would be called upon to join the jury if one of the 12 isn't able to complete the full trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge moves Trump contempt hearing up one day, to April 23\n\nJudge Juan Merchan moved the date for a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be held in contempt in the New York hush money case. The hearing will now be held on Tuesday, April 23, one day sooner than originally planned.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy argued earlier in the day that Trump should be held in contempt and fined $3,000 for three social media posts that Conroy said violated the judge's prohibition on Trump publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses.\n\nMerchan didn't announce any change to the deadline for Trump's legal team to respond in writing to the prosecution's allegations in advance of the hearing: it remains April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential Trump jurors begin going through security\n\nAt 2:05 p.m. ET potential jurors began going through the security that's in place before they can enter the courtroom for Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has already decided on 42 questions the jury candidates will be asked. Prosecutors and the Trump defense team will also be able to ask follow-up questions.\n\nMerchan isn't allowing questions about whether jurors voted for Trump or intend to vote for him. But he has allowed several questions that could reveal a juror's political preferences. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended either a Trump rally or an anti-Trump rally, and whether they have ever followed Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nIf potential jurors' answers indicate they probably can't be impartial in the case, Merchan has said he will strike them from consideration. For any potential jurors Merchan doesn't excuse from further service, the two sides will have the option of disqualifying them themselves, though that power isn't unlimited.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is a Sandoval hearing?\n\nIf you've been following Donald Trump's criminal hush money case so far, you may have heard the term \"Sandoval hearing\" earlier in the day. But what does the term mean?\n\nIt's basically a short hearing that happens before trials. A judge is asked what previous actions or factors can be brought up during a trial, weighing the potential impact on the case at large.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAs Trump goes on trial, asylum seekers a block away navigate immigration system\n\nA block from Donald Trump’s trial, New York's Federal Plaza had a steady flow of patrons Monday morning for immigration court. The city has faced the arrival of nearly 200,000 migrants, many bused in from the U.S.-Mexico border, in the past two years.\n\nUnder a treelined path outside the federal building, Alex Rojas, a 24-year-old Venezuelan man, read his book, “Red White & Royal Blue,” an LGBTQ romance novel by Casey McQuiston. The Manhattan criminal courthouse, where Trump was on trial for hiding hush money payments, loomed behind Rojas.\n\nHe's been in the U.S. for six months, without a work permit, and is seeking political asylum due to dangers of violence toward gay people in Venezuela. Rojas, who hopes to work as a physical therapist, admitted he didn’t know much about American politics, but he knew about Trump’s stance on immigration.\n\n“I think he’s going to deport all of us from here,” Rojas said, with nervous laughter. “I don’t think he likes migrants much, even less Venezuelans.”\n\nAs court adjourned for lunch, Rojas also left, heading back to his shelter in the Bronx. He’d return to Manhattan in the morning, as would Trump, to appear in court.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\n96 jurors to be called in for initial questioning\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said 96 jurors will be called in for initial questioning as the jury selection process gets underway in Donald Trump's New York hush money case. In total, Merchan said 500 prospective jurors have been called on for service in the case.\n\nWe are waiting for prospective jurors to arrive in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge will hold hearing on whether to hold Donald Trump in contempt April 24\n\nFollowing a lunch break, Judge Juan Merchan declared he will hold a hearing on Wednesday, April 24 about whether Donald Trump violated a gag order through posts on his Truth Social media platform and should be held in contempt.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy earlier in the day argued Merchan should hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 – or $1,000 for each of three alleged violations.\n\nMerchan told Trump's legal team to file its response on the gag order allegations by April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrial schedule: Holidays, Barron Trump's high school graduation and more\n\nWhile Donald Trump's hush money trial is expected to extend six to eight weeks, the former president won't be in the courtroom every day. Judge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that the trial will take a break on Wednesdays for its duration, and there will not be any trial on April 29, NBC News reported.\n\nThe judge also said there will not be any trial dates that would conflict with religious observances. That could include Passover, though the courtroom hours could simply be cut short on April 22 and 23.\n\nThe case will also potentially adjourn for the high school graduation of Barron Trump, Donald Trump's youngest son, next month.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolice investigating bomb threat at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's home\n\nPolice say they are investigating a bomb threat targeting the home of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday morning, according to the Associated Press. Law enforcement official said a 911 caller reported the threat just before 9 a.m. ET.\n\nIt's not the first time Bragg has faced an emergency situation in recent months. A powdery substance was discovered last month in a threatening letter in a mailroom at Bragg's offices, the AP reported.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nProsecutor wants Donald Trump held in contempt, $3,000 fine, for alleged gag order violations\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy asked Judge Juan Merchan to hold Donald Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for allegedly violating the judge's gag order. The order prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case.\n\nConroy pointed to three Trump social media posts that he said each warrant a $1,000 fine.\n\nOne post featured a statement from Michael Avenatti, who was once a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, that it is \"outrageous that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews\" talking badly about Trump, but Trump is gagged if he responds. Trump reposted the comment along with his own thanks to Avenatti \"for revealing the truth about two sleaze bags\" who have hurt the country with lies.\n\nIn 2022, Avenatti was convicted of identify theft and wire fraud for stealing from Daniels and sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nConroy also said Trump violated the gag order by posting a photograph of a publicly available 2018 statement by Daniels denying she had a sexual encounter with Trump. A further violation allegedly occurred when Trump posted about Cohen, asking, \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the defense would like the chance to respond in writing.\n\nThe judge didn't make an immediate decision.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWas Donald Trump falling asleep at hush money trial?\n\nThe former president appeared to nod off before the trial's lunch break, closing his eyes briefly and jerking awake multiple times, according to several reports.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill Trump testify in his hush money case?\n\nTrump said on Friday that he will testify at the trial.\n\n\"I’m testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case, they have no case,\" Trump said at a Palm Beach press conference.\n\nHowever, the former president has backed out of testifying before.\n\nIn his New York civil fraud case, Trump was forced to testify under a state subpoena when the state attorney general's office was putting on its case. At that time, Trump's legal team didn't ask him a single question on cross-examination. Trump later said he would testify when it was the defense's turn to call their own witnesses. But the day before his scheduled testimony, he backed out.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt takes a lunch break\n\nThe proceedings in the Manhattan courtroom have paused until 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nE. Jean Carroll deposition will not be allowed in Trump trial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Monday also said prosecutors cannot show a deposition from columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.\n\nA jury last year found Trump liable of sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her. In January, a jury also ruled that Trump must pay the columnist $83.3 million in damages for defamation.\n\nBut on Monday, Merchan warned that Carroll's deposition could risk \"building in a trial into a trial.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAnti-Trump press conference takes place near courtroom\n\nA few blocks from the courtroom at nearby Foley Square, a group of anti-Trump protestors gathered for a press conference. Advocates held up large orange letters reading “No one is above the law” as a series of speakers addressed the election interference charges against the former president.\n\nIn a federal case and state-level case in Georgia, Donald Trump is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nRobert Weisman, president of the non-profit Public Citizen spoke from a podium emblazoned with “Election interference is a crime.\"\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is hush money?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump rails against Michael Cohen, despite gag order\n\nThe former president has shown a penchant for launching accusations and insults towards judges, prosecutors and potential witnesses he deems hostile, but he could face fines or even jail time if Judge Juan Merchan determines it runs afoul of a gag order.\n\nBased on what Merchan described as a history of \"threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" statements against officials, court staff, and prosecutors, the judge issued an order barring Trump from publicly commenting about the participation of potential witnesses in the case, such as porn star Stormy Daniels and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDespite the gag order's restriction on comments about witnesses, Trump posted on Saturday \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nMerchan also prohibited public statements about court staff and prosecution lawyers other than Bragg, as well as their family members, if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with their work in the case.\n\nDays after that order was issued, Trump attacked Merchan's daughter in a series of posts on Trump's Truth Social media platform, calling her \"a Rabid Trump Hater\" and posting a photo of her, leading the judge to expand the gag order to prohibit the former president from publicly commenting on Merchan's or Bragg's family members if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with work in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury won't watch 'Access Hollywood' tape, judge reiterates\n\nJudge Juan Merchan previously ruled that the jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial can hear testimony about Trump's comments on the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, but can't watch the tape.\n\nMerchan reiterated that ruling on Monday, saying he continues to regard the video as too prejudicial against Trump to be permitted in the trial. In the tape, Trump crudely describes grabbing women. The release of the tape in early October of 2016 is important context for Trump's alleged $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, according to prosecutors. They say he feared another scandal would further endanger his standing with women voters in the fast-approaching election.\n\nFor that reason, Trump authorized the payment by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, which constituted a campaign contribution in excess of federal campaign finance limits, prosecutors say. One reason Trump faces felony charges of falsifying business records, as opposed to misdemeanors, is that the alleged falsification was done to conceal that separate federal crime, prosecutors say.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Michael Cohen go to prison?\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to concealing more than $4 million from the IRS and \"causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen arranged a $150,000 payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison but was released early to home detention because of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump's supporters gather to demonstrate outside Manhattan courthouse\n\nAmong the crowd outside the courtroom was Vish Burra, 33, the executive secretary of the New York Young Republican Club, which helped organize the protest.\n\nSporting a black “Make America Great Again” hat, Burra, a former aide to embattled former Rep. George Santos, scanned the crowd and captured some videos of anti-Trump protesters on his phone.\n\nHe voted for Obama in 2012 but is now an ardent supporter of Trump. Free trade, immigration policy, and anti-war beliefs brought him into the GOP.\n\n“Donald Trump didn’t start any new wars when he was president and not only that but his strong presence kept people at peace, kept people at bay.”\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJudge Juan Merchan says jury won't hear about Melania Trump's pregnancy during alleged affair\n\nAttorneys and Judge Juan Merchan are addressing a series of issues this morning about what testimony and evidence can be introduced in the trial.\n\nMerchan tentatively ruled in the morning that Melania Trump's pregnancy during an alleged affair between Trump and former Playboy model Karen McDougal can't be shared with the jury.\n\nMerchan previously ruled that the prosecution can call McDougal to the witness stand even though Trump isn't charged with falsifying business records to cover up an alleged hush money payment she received. McDougal has said she and the real estate mogul had an affair over many months, which Trump denies. In the earlier ruling, Merchan said McDougal's testimony about steps taken to secure her story \"complete the narrative\" in the prosecution's case.\n\nHowever, Merchan said Monday he doesn't believe \"at this moment\" that testimony or evidence about Melania Trump's pregnancy is necessary.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'It's going to backfire'\n\nBijaya Acharya, 32, slept just a couple hours after finishing driving for Uber so he could take the train from Queens to see Donald Trump leave Trump Tower in the morning ahead of his trial. Then, Acharya, donning the iconic red “Make America Great Again” hat, went to the lower Manhattan courthouse to support the former president.\n\nAcharya, a native of Nepal, lives in Jackson Heights, a diverse, immigrant Queens neighborhood, in one of the world’s most diverse, immigrant cities. Still, he supports Trump because of his push to crack down on crime and illegal immigration, two issues Acharya said he sees in New York City.\n\nSince becoming a citizen in 2021, he plans to vote in his first presidential election. He believes the trial only helps Trump’s chances of winning: “It’s going to backfire,” he said. “It’s not going to hurt him.”\n\nAcharya planned to stay outside the courthouse until the afternoon. He normally worked at night, anyway.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat will potential jurors be asked in Trump's NY case?\n\nAhead of trial, Merchan decided on a list of 42 questions the potential jurors will be asked, with both sides also having a chance to ask follow-up questions.\n\nSeveral of the questions could help the trial teams figure out if a potential juror has a bias when it comes to Trump that could undermine the ability to be impartial. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended a Trump or anti-Trump rally, and whether they follow Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nBut jurors will also be asked basic biographical information, like where they live, whether they're married, whether a loved one has ever been a victim of a crime.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLooking for an unbiased jury in Donald Trump's hush money case\n\nStarting Monday, Donald Trump's and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's trial teams will each be working to select 12 jurors and several alternates who give them the best odds of winning.\n\nEach side will get a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" – essentially vetoes – they can use to exclude potential jurors. Judge Juan Merchan will also be tasked with striking jurors whose responses to questions indicate they probably can't be impartial.\n\nIt's a case that turns some of the normal ways of thinking about jury selection on their head, according to Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a seasoned jury consultant who assisted O.J. Simpson's murder trial defense team.\n\n\"In a normal criminal case, it is the prosecution that's looking for the white, older male, and it is the defense that's looking for the minority individual, the anti-police individual − but in this case it's actually reversed,\" Dimitrius told USA TODAY.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan denies Trump's recusal push over his daughter\n\nTrial Judge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom and began his remarks in the proceedings by denying a Trump motion for his own recusal.\n\nTrump's legal team argued in the motion that a marketing agency headed by the judge's daughter benefits reputationally and financially by targeting Trump, rendering the judge's role in the case improper. The agency does work for Democratic political candidates.\n\nIn rejecting that argument, Merchan noted an opinion from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that Merchan's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on his daughter's work because Trump's case doesn't involve her business.\n\nMerchan already rejected a Trump motion for Merchan's recusal in August. Trump argued in the new motion that his success in the Republican primaries since August has \"cemented his status as a political target\" of the daughter's agency.\n\n\"The court will not address this matter further,\" Merchan said Monday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Donald Trump loses Hail Mary call for judge's recusal ahead of New York hush money trial\n\nTodd Blanche and Susan Necheles: Donald Trump's lawyers\n\nThey aren’t household names yet like their universally known client, Donald Trump. But the lawyers trying to keep the former president out of prison in his New York hush money trial − Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles − likely will become minor celebrities once the court battle gets going this week.\n\nA year ago, when a grim-faced Trump made history as the first former president to face criminal charges, Blanche and Necheles sat by his side as he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records associated with hush money payments to two women.\n\nBlanche, who usually does talking in court on the hush-money case, told reporters that Trump was determined to fight the charges.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Blanche said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial in New York marks a historic moment: The first time a former president has even been on trial and facing criminal charges. The unprecedented case is also set against the backdrop of one of the busiest cities in the world.\n\nBefore the trial started on Monday, Mike Jamison, 67, of Philadelphia, stood alone against the barricades opposite the courthouse.\n\nWhile visiting his brother in Brooklyn, he said he stopped by the courthouse “for the circus.” He is a Democrat who planned to vote again for President Joe Biden.“I think he should get convicted,” Jamison said of Trump. “But who knows, you know? It only takes one juror.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, funneled the money through the publication National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nMcDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for about 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDonald Trump begins fundraising off of trial\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump entered the courtroom, his campaign texted out solicitations for donations, saying “I'M IN COURT NOW!” in an all-caps message.\n\nTrump said in the text, “They're trying to DESTROY ME - BUT YOU CAN STOP THEM!” The former president has long claimed that the criminal charges against him are targeting his reelection campaign, though there's no evidence of that. – David Jackson\n\nWho is Alvin Bragg?\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor to secure a criminal indictment against a former president. On Monday the world's attention will turn to Bragg as Trump's trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records begins.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office won convictions against two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer. Allen Weisselberg was sentenced to five months in prison after pleading guilty to 15 charges in a scheme to avoid taxes. Two Trump corporations were fined a combined $1.6 million for convictions of 17 felonies.\n\nBragg said company officials “have to play by the rules” and that Weisselberg used his position to get lavish perks such as a rent-free Manhattan apartment, multiple Mercedes Benz cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren – “all without paying required taxes.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels alleged that Donald Trump had consensual sex with her in 2006 – months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump.\n\nTrump’s then-attorney and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence claims that she had an affair with Trump after she was willing to go public about the scandal.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump: ‘I’m very honored to be here’\n\nDonald Trump gave a one-minute statement to reporters before entering the courtroom, alleging without evidence that his hush-money trial is “political persecution” and “an assault on America.”\n\nTrump cited unnamed legal scholars calling the case “nonsense.”\n\n“It’s a case that should have never been brought” Trump said, adding “I’m very honored to be here.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nAndrew Giuliani calls for 'unbiased jurors' in Trump hush money case\n\nAndrew Giuliani, son of longtime Trump advisor and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, stood among a mix of reporters and Trump supporters waving flags. He acknowledged the difficulty with jury selection because so many have opinions about the president. But he believed if people looked at the facts of the case, Trump would be acquitted.\n\n“You need two or three in there, even one,” Andrew Giuliani said. “But two or three, that way you don’t have one that gets bullied around by the others. I’m just hopeful that you do have a few unbiased jurors in there.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nDonald Trump arrives in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump just entered the Manhattan courtroom for the first day of his New York criminal trial. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie.\n\nIt's an unprecedented moment. Trump is the first former president ever to face criminal charges. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover-up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe court has estimated the trial will last between six and eight weeks. Jury selection alone could last several days or even multiple weeks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow many indictments does Trump have?\n\nTrump has been indicted on 91 charges across four separate criminal cases. However, some of those charges have since been dismissed, bringing the current total to 88.\n\nIn Trump's New York case accusing him of making hush money payments before the 2016 election, he faces 34 felony counts\n\nIn the federal case accusing Trump of mishandling classified documents, Trump is charged with 40 felony counts\n\nTrump also faces a federal case accusing him of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. He faces 4 felony counts there\n\nIn the Georgia case accusing him of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the Peach State, the former president 10 felony counts.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley & Bart Jansen\n\nWhy is Donald Trump on trial?\n\nThe trial will feature some salacious allegations. Prosecutors claim Trump falsified records to conceal that he was reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels has said she had sex with the real estate mogul shortly after his wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to their son, Barron. Trump denies Daniels' claim, and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nThe charges are felonies, as opposed to misdemeanors, because prosecutors claim Trump falsified the records in order to conceal violating federal election laws through a payment that was meant to help his 2016 presidential campaign but exceeded campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe payment was made less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also allege the records were falsified in order to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSmall (but passionate) crowd gathers outside Trump trial\n\nOutside the Manhattan courtroom where the former president's criminal hush money trial was set to begin Monday, the press and police presence seemed to outnumber the protestors significantly. A large flag that red “Trump 2024: Save America” waved above a small crowd demonstrators who appeared to support the president.\n\nOn the other side of a set of barricades, protestors criticizing the president walked silently behind a banner reading “no one is above the law.” A few nearby Trump supporters shouted at them, one with a bullhorn who repeated “Donald Trump did nothing wrong”\n\nJamie Bauer, who is part of Rise and Resist which formed after Trump’s election says the group has come out to protest every case. “They want to provoke us so that it will look like they’re the victims of left-wing aggression” they said of the pro-Trump crowd.– Anna Kaufman\n\nKey players in Trump's hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received $130,000 to keep quiet before the 2016 election are the key witnesses expected at his New York trial.\n\nCohen arranged the payment to Daniels, in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement about her claim she had sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty and spent time in prison on charges including a campaign finance violation for influencing the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has blasted Cohen as unreliable because he is a convicted perjurer and disbarred lawyer. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she was eager to sign the non-disclosure agreement to get the episode behind her.\n\nTrump has denied having a relationship with her. He has argued he was paying Cohen and that he was unaware of money going to Daniels.\n\nTrump could also potentially testify, as he did at his civil fraud trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump arrives at NY courthouse\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the Manhattan courthouse where he's facing sweeping criminal charges in a hush money case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat time does the Trump trial start today?\n\nProceedings are expected to begin at 9:30 ET on Monday morning in the Manhattan courtroom where Donald Trump is facing sweeping criminal charges.\n\nRemember, jury selection begins in the case on Monday, so lawyers won't be presenting their cases just yet. But that will come soon: The trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks in total.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long will Trump's trial last? Here's a timeline\n\nThe trial will last about six-to-eight weeks, according to a court media advisory.\n\nThe trial will start with jury selection Monday, which could be an especially lengthy process given many potential jurors will likely have opinions about former President Donald Trump that both sides may want to explore. New York law requires unanimity from a 12-person jury to convict a criminal defendant in a felony case.\n\nNormally, the trial would then proceed into opening arguments, which give both sides the chance to provide an outline to jurors of what they believe the evidence will show, followed by the prosecution calling witnesses to testify and introducing evidence. The defense will try to poke holes in the prosecution's case through cross-examination, and then will have the option of putting calling its own witnesses and introducing its own evidence.\n\nFinally, the parties will give closing arguments, and the jury will be tasked with rendering a verdict.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhere can I watch the Trump trial?\n\nThe trial won't be televised, as is typical in New York courts. Reporters will be present in the courtroom and an overflow room that will have a live stream of the proceedings.\n\nTrump may hold press conferences outside of court and speak to reporters in the courthouse hallway.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nQuiet morning waiting for Donald Trump's trial to start\n\nThere appear to be more reporters than demonstrators before Donald Trump’s trial started Monday morning in lower Manhattan.Police have barricades down the middle of Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. Last year, when prosecutors arraigned Trump, the barricades separated pro-Trump demonstrators with those against the former president.\n\nOn Monday, the crowds appear to be mixed, waiting. A few held signs against Trump. There was one large pro-Trump flag waving near the courthouse.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty?\n\nTrump could theoretically face more than a decade in prison if he's convicted on all counts in the criminal hush money case. But several legal experts told USA TODAY such a dramatic outcome is unlikely.\n\nInstead, Trump would likely face a sentence between probation and four years of prison, and he would probably still be out to freely campaign in the 2024 presidential election while his all-but-certain appeal ran its course.\n\nIf Trump were sentenced to jail or prison time, it's also unclear what that would look like. As a former president, he enjoys around-the-clock Secret Service protection, and no former president has ever been prosecuted. Special accommodations may be needed at a jail or prison, and the sentencing judge could also consider alternative arrangements such as house arrest or placement at some other secure location.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat's happening today in Donald Trump's trial?\n\nJury selection is scheduled to start Monday and last several days, if not multiple weeks.\n\nThe process will involve Trump's legal team and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office wrangling over who should make it into the pool of 12 jurors and several alternates who will be tasked with deciding whether Trump is guilty.\n\nThe former president lost a flurry of motions and appeals in recent days seeking to delay the proceedings. But unlike in his three other criminal cases, which deal with allegations that he tried to illegally steal the 2020 presidential election and mishandled classified documents, delay tactics haven't allowed him to avoid the start of this trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump's campaign addresses charges, witnesses and judge\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign issued a statement late Sunday dubbed a “trial fact sheet” as jury selection begins in his New York hush-money case, including that he “did nothing wrong” and the trial is a “full-frontal assault on American Democracy.”\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide payments to Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump’s fact sheet says Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned in 2021 on the potential to prosecute Trump. Bragg campaigned noting he sued Trump more than 100 times while working at the state Attorney General’s Office.\n\nTrump’s statement also notes that case relies on testimony from his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is a convicted felon, perjurer and disbarred lawyer. The statement also complained about Judge Juan Merchan’s “bizarre” schedule for the trial, as appeals linger to dismiss charges.\n\n“This is an unprecedented abuse of our legal system,” Trump’s statement said about the trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump lost several bids to delay his hush money trial\n\nA series of New York judges this month rejected pleas from former President Donald Trump to delay the criminal trial.\n\nIn one request, Trump said Judge Juan Merchan should delay the trial until after the Supreme Court has ruled on the scope of presidential immunity in a separate Trump case dealing with federal election interference charges. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments on that issue April 25.\n\nBut Merchan said Trump raised the argument too late. Trump only made the argument in March, almost a year after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the charges on April 4, 2023.\n\nOn Friday, Merchan rejected a separate Trump delay request based on his argument that pre-trial publicity about the case created unfair prejudice against him. Merchan said the right way to address that concern is to have a thorough jury selection process.\n\nIn addition, last week three different judges from a New York appeals court each rejected last-minute delay requests from Trump. The former president argued he should get a delay until the appeals court rules on his arguments for moving the trial out of Manhattan and tossing out Merchan's limited gag order against him, and until Merchan rules on his latest request for Merchan's recusal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/04/23/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-pink-moon-tuesdays-news/73429441007/", "title": "Donald Trump hush money trial, Larry Nassar sexual abuse, pink ...", "text": "A media executive took the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.

For the latest news from Trump's hush money trial in New York, read our live trial updates for Thursday, April 25.\n\nNEW YORK — Former media executive David Pecker retook the witness stand on in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial Tuesday.\n\nPecker testified that he used National Enquirer to promote Trump's 2016 campaign interests, including stifling a story about an alleged love-child of Trump's. Pecker's actions were part of a \"catch-and-kill\" conspiracy with Trump to quash stories that could hurt Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to prosecutors.\n\nTuesday's proceedings began with arguments over whether the former president should be held in contempt for allegedly violating a gag order.\n\nProsecutors say Trump has violated that order at least 10 times and the judge should not only fine the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but also warn him he could get jail time if things don't change. Even Monday, Trump again attacked potential witness Michael Cohen outside the courtroom, saying Cohen \"got caught lying, pure lying\" in a previous trial.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump complains gag order silences him but not others\n\nAfter Donald Trump thundered against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, before court Tuesday, the former president left after the trial adjourned for the day without mentioning Cohen by name because of a gag order not to comment on potential witnesses.\n\n\"The case is a sham,” Trump told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. \"We have a gag order, which to me is totally unconstitutional. I’m not allowed to talk, but people can talk about me. They can talk about me, they can say whatever they want, they can lie, but I’m not allowed to say anything.”\n\nCohen, who is expected to testify about paying $130,000 to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels for Trump, called Trump a profanity in a social media post and said “no one is above the law.”\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered Trump not to comment on potential witnesses such as Cohen. Prosecutors urged him Tuesday to fine Trump $1,000 for each of at least 10 alleged violations so far, but Merchan didn’t rule immediately.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJudge ends Tuesday proceedings\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ended Tuesday proceedings and Trump exited the courtroom at 2:02 p.m. ET.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump allegedly said: 'Anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out'\n\nPecker testified that he recommended Trump buy McDougal's story and Trump responded: \"I don't buy any stories.\" Trump added: \"Anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out.\"\n\nPecker still recommended keeping the story from getting out. Trump said he wanted to think about it and he would have Cohen call Pecker.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCohen allegedly asked for non-traceable communication as McDougal story arose\n\nPecker testified that he was speaking to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen frequently around the first week of June in 2016, which was around when Karen McDougal's story came up. While previously they spoke \"probably\" a couple times a week, they were now speaking almost every day, sometimes a couple of times a day.\n\nCohen suggested that he and Pecker communicate over Signal, a communication application. Cohen said no one would be able to trace it or listen in, and the conversation would be destroyed after the call, according to Pecker. Pecker added he doesn't know if that's true.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPlayboy model Karen McDougal's story being discussed\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass is now asking David Pecker about former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story. McDougal alleged that she had an affair with Trump that overlapped with Melania Trump's pregnancy. Trump denies the claim.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSajudin only released from exclusivity agreement after election\n\nPecker said he told then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen that Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin's story of an alleged Trump love-child wasn't true and Sajudin was difficult to deal with. Pecker suggested releasing Sajudin from the agreement to keep his story exclusive, adding that keeping Sajudin locked in would cause more problems. Cohen said not to release Sajudin until after the November, 2016 election. Sajudin was released in December.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBiggest story 'since the death of Elvis Presley'\n\nPecker said Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin's story of a Trump love-child would have been the biggest National Enquirer story \"since the death of Elvis Presley.\" He said if the story turned out to be true, he would have published it after the 2016 presidential election. \"That was the conversation I had with Michael Cohen, and that's what we agreed to,\" Pecker said.\n\nHowever, in investigating the story, Pecker's team concluded the story was completely untrue. He said he still paid $30,000 to keep it from getting out through another media outlet and hurting the Trump campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'The boss will be very pleased': Pecker says he agreed to buy love-child story\n\nPecker said he called then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen and said they needed to move forward with getting Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin's story, and had a negotiated price for the story of $30,000. Pecker said he would pay for it and Cohen thanked him, adding, \"The boss will be very pleased.\" Donald Trump was \"the boss,\" Pecker confirmed.\n\nCohen later spoke to Pecker and said Trump would take a DNA test and the story of a love child between them is \"absolutely impossible.\" Pecker said that wouldn't be necessary, and that his team would vet the story.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor asks about Trump Tower doorman's widely questioned story on Trump love child\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked David Pecker who Dino Sajudin is. Pecker replied he was a doorman at Trump Tower who, Pecker heard, was selling a story about Trump allegedly fathering a child with a maid. \"I immediately called Michael Cohen,\" Pecker said. Cohen replied that the story is \"absolutely not true,\" but said he would check it out, according to Pecker.\n\nSajudin's story has been widely questioned. Sajudin only claimed to have been told about the child, and a New Yorker investigation \"uncovered no evidence that Trump fathered the child.\" Trump has denied Sajudin's story.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n‘No one is above the law’: Cohen\n\nMichael Cohen, the former personal lawyer to Donald Trump, who is expected to be a key witness in the trial, fired back Tuesday at the former president’s criticism in social media posts and statements to reporters.\n\nCohen was imprisoned after pleading guilty to charges including lying to Congress about a Trump real estate project in Moscow and for a campaign violation for paying to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He is expected to testify about the payment to Daniels.\n\nTrump has been trashing Cohen as a liar and a poor lawyer before he was disbarred. But Cohen said Tuesday in a statement he learned about his own strength during 51 days in solitary confinement.\n\n“Strong enough to ensure that truth will prevail over Donald and his acolytes’ incessant lying and denigration of me; in the court hallways or his UNtruth Social platform,” Cohen said. “Regardless. no one is above the law.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPecker re-takes the witness stand\n\nDavid Pecker re-took the witness stand at 12:51 p.m. ET. The judge and the legal teams are already back in the courtroom. We are waiting for the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Emil Bove?\n\nEmil Bove is one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers, along with Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. Politico reported he joined the cohort in September 2023.\n\nBove is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n“Emil is an expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation and his trial skills are among the best in the business,” Blanche said in a statement provided to Politico.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nJudge declares a short break\n\nJudge Juan Merchan declared a short break at about 12:40 p.m. ET. Court is scheduled to end early at 2 p.m. ET today, in light of the Passover holiday, and is running through lunch.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge excuses jurors for 'short break' after Steve Bannon raised in court proceedings\n\nTrump defense lawyer Emil Bove objected as the prosecution was asking David Pecker about Steve Bannon's involvement. The legal teams had a private conversation at the judge's bench before the judge excused the jurors for a short break, while others remain in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'TED CRUZ SEX SCANDAL – 5 SECRET MISTRESSES' – examples shown of allegedly planted stories\n\nThe prosecution has shown stories about Ben Carson and Ted Cruz on screens inside the courtroom. Pecker confirmed the articles were run in accordance with the agreement he says he reached with Donald Trump and Michael Cohen in Trump Tower to help the Trump campaign.\n\nOne story headline shown to the jury, which appeared to have been posted on March 30, 2016, said: \"TED CRUZ SEX SCANDAL – 5 SECRET MISTRESSES.\" The story had a subheading stating: \"The romps that are rocking his presidential campaign!\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker believed Cohen was calling on behalf of Trump\n\nPecker testified that, when Cohen would call Pecker and say, \"We would like\" for a negative story on a Trump opponent, Pecker understood Cohen to be calling on behalf of Trump.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow Cohen would plant negative stories on Trump opponents: Pecker\n\nMichael Cohen would call David Pecker and say, \"We would like\" for you to run a negative article on a certain political opponent, Pecker testified. Then Cohen would send Pecker information about, say, Ted Cruz, or Ben Carson, or Marco Rubio, and that was the basis for The National Enquirer's story, Pecker said.\n\n\"Then we would embellish it from there,\" Pecker added. He described specifically adding photos, planning out how to execute the story – things that he said went beyond just coming up with a story headline.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Highly confidential': What Pecker says he told Michael Cohen\n\nPecker testified that he told Cohen the agreement to help the Trump presidential campaign had to be \"highly confidential.\" Pecker said the arrangement was designed to have him vetting stories first and then sharing them with Cohen. Pecker said, in order to help the campaign, he wanted to keep things as quiet as possible.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did David Pecker think women would be selling stories on Trump?\n\nPecker testified that he thought a number of women would try to sell stories because Trump was \"well known as the most eligible bachelor and dated the most beautiful women.\" He said it was clear based on his past experience that when someone is running for public office, it is very common for women to call up a place like The National Enquirer to try to sell their stories, or Pecker would hear in the marketplace that women's stories were being marketed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker promised to notify Michael Cohen of any women selling stories on Trump\n\nDavid Pecker described a meeting about what his magazines could do to help the Trump presidential campaign. Pecker testified he made the following promise: \"I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents.\"\n\nPecker testified that he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" because he knew the Trump Organization had a \"very small staff.\" Pecker said he promised that, if he heard anything negative about Trump or anything about women selling stories, he would notify Michael Cohen, as he did over the last several years. Cohen would then have the stories killed, Pecker testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump noted National Enquirer poll while considering presidential run: Pecker\n\nPecker testified about passing on information to Trump that a poll showed 80% of The National Enquirer would want Trump to run for president. That may be a reference to 80% of the publicaton's readers. Trump later cited that poll in an interview with Matt Lauer on The Today Show, Pecker said. Trump announced his candidacy for president at a later date, Pecker said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump's approach to money? 'Very frugal': Pecker\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked David Pecker about Donald Trump's approach to money. Pecker said Trump was \"very cautious\" and \"very frugal.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump is 'very detail-oriented' and a 'micromanager': Pecker\n\nDavid Pecker testified that he and Trump would mostly reach each other through their offices over the years. He described Trump as knowledgable and \"very detail-oriented,\" adding that he would characterize Trump almost as a \"micromanager\" who looked at all of the aspects of whatever issue was going on.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'The Apprentice' TV show helped Pecker's magazines: Pecker\n\nDavid Pecker testified that Trump's \"The Apprentice\" TV show was helpful to Pecker's magazines because the audience for The National Enquirer and other celebrity magazines followed Trump \"religiously.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I've had a great relationship with Mr. Trump over the years': Pecker\n\nDavid Pecker said he met Donald Trump at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club around 1988 or 1989. \"I've had a great relationship with Mr. Trump over the years,\" Pecker said. Trump was very helpful in introducing Pecker to other media people, Pecker said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge clarifies there will be no trial proceedings on Monday\n\nJudge Juan Merchan clarified that there will be no trial proceedings on Monday, April 29, and there will be a full day of trial proceedings on Tuesday, April 30. Merchan mistakenly gave different scheduling instructions yesterday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump blasts ‘kangaroo court’ during trial\n\nDuring a recess in the trial, while Judge Juan Merchan mulled whether to fine Trump for violating his gag order, Trump posted more all-caps criticism of the judge on social media.\n\n“This is a kangaroo court, and the judge should recuse himself!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nMerchan didn’t bar criticism of himself in the gag order.\n\nTrump asked for Merchan to be removed from the case because his daughter works for Democratic politicians. But Merchan refused to withdraw, based on the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics finding the case didn't involve Loren Merchan or her business either \"directly or indirectly.\"\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nDavid Pecker enters courtroom\n\nProsecution witness David Pecker entered the courtroom at 11:22 a.m. ET. Judge Merchan reminded him he is still under oath. Merchan just asked for the jury to be brought in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump re-enters courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his defense team re-entered the courtroom at about 11:01 a.m. ET after a break in proceedings. The prosecution team is here as well. We are still waiting for the judge to arrive.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump ignores reporter questions on gag order\n\nAs Trump walked through the hallway on a break in proceedings, he didn't respond to the following reporter questions on whether he will keep posting on Truth Social or if his lawyer has credibility.\n\nAre you going to keep Truthing?\n\nHow are your lawyers doing?\n\nDoes your lawyer have any credibility?\n\nJudge to rule on alleged gag order violations later\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said he will rule on Trump's alleged gag order violations later. He made that statement after a lengthy back-and-forth with Trump lawyer Todd Blanche. Merchan did say Trump's defense team didn't prove anything relevant by pointing out that Trump had a history of re-posting things without the prosecution always coming to the court to argue that those re-posts were violations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge questions Trump lawyer's suggestion that re-posting is not violation\n\nSome of the alleged gag order violations involve Trump re-posting a news article or statement by someone else. Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche questioned treating those re-posts as gag order violations by Trump. But Blanche also confirmed to Judge Merchan that re-posting requires active behavior. He said a group of folks work with Trump and when they see articles they believe Trump's audience should read, they take an action to re-post them.\n\nMerchan questioned the proposition that Blanche could call something a \"re-post\" and then Trump could wash his hands of it.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Judge Merchan issue a gag order?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan issued a gag order restricting Trump's speech based on what Merchan said was a history of \"threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" statements by Trump against officials, prosecutors, and court staff. The statements instilled fear in people involved in Trump's legal cases and heightened security needs, according to Merchan.\n\nSuch statements \"undoubtedly risk impeding the orderly administration of this Court,\" according to the March 26 order.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche addresses judge on gag order\n\nTrump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has begun addressing the judge. \"He's allowed to respond to political attacks, your honor,\" Blanche said, defending Trump's statements.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution not asking Trump be incarcerated – for now\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy ended his remarks by asking Judge Merchan to remind Trump that incarceration is an option \"should it be necessary,\" if Trump keeps violating the gag order. \"It has to stop,\" Conroy adds. For now, the prosecution wants Trump held in criminal contempt and fined.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat are the restrictions under the Trump gag order?\n\nUnder the gag order, Trump is prohibited from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case, such as former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nMerchan also barred Trump from publicly commenting on court staff and prosecution lawyers other than Bragg, as well as their family members, if the comments are intended to significantly interfere with their work in the case. That protection was also extended to Merchan's and Bragg's family members.\n\nTrump is also prohibited from publicly commenting on jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor running through each alleged Trump gag order violation\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy is detailing each alleged Trump gag order violation. Many of the alleged violations deal with Trump going after his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. \"This is while we're on trial. The trial has now begun,\" Conroy emphasized as he discussed a post.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump promotes Pennsylvania primary\n\nSticking to political subjects, Trump urged voters to the polls in Pennsylvania for the Tuesday primary.\n\nTrump supported GOP Senate candidate David McCormick in his campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.\n\n“It’s very important to let them that we’re coming on Nov. 5, we’re coming big,” Trump said. “Pennsylvania get out and vote.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nProsecutor says Trump violated gag order again Monday\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy has begun addressing Judge Merchan about Trump's alleged gag order violations. In addition to the 10 instances the prosecution already identified to the judge, Conroy says Trump violated the order again yesterday when he spoke to press in the courthouse hallway. Trump said there that potential prosecution witness Michael Cohen \"got caught lying, pure lying\" in a previous trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump blasts college protests over Israel\n\nFormer President Donald Trump focused on politics before entering the courtroom Tuesday, blasting student protesters and arguing that President Joe Biden will never achieve peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump criticized protests at Columbia, New York University and other schools against the Israeli war in Gaza. He argued radicals are trying to tear down colleges. People want to protest outside the court but are blocked by the police presence, he said.\n\n“What’s going on is a disgrace to our country and it’s all Biden’s fault and everybody knows it,” Trump told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. “Peace will never happen with a guy like this.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLawyers and judge in Trump trial have returned\n\nAt 9:39 a.m. ET, the lawyers and Judge Juan Merchan re-entered the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge and lawyers having private conversation\n\nProceedings started with one of the lawyers asking to approach the judge and then lawyers from both trial teams leaving the courtroom with the judge through a back doorway. Trump is now, as of 9:35 a.m. ET, seated all alone at his defense table. He is wearing a dark blue suit jacket and a red tie.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan arrives\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 9:32 a.m. ET. As he usually does, Merchan said a general \"Good morning\" to the prosecution and defense teams and a specific, \"Good morning, Mr. Trump,\" to Trump himself.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Alvin Bragg?\n\nAlvin Bragg is the Manhattan District Attorney. Last year, he became the first prosecutor to secure a criminal indictment against a former president.\n\nBragg is a Harlem native who earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University and became an assistant state attorney general and an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before being elected district attorney in 2021.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, campaigned as an avid criminal justice reformer. Trump has tried to portray him as uninterested in combatting street crime. However, Bragg's office notes that violent crime has dropped in the borough during his tenure.\n\nBart Jansen & Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump arrives for Tuesday proceedings\n\nFormer President Donald Trump walked into the courtroom at 9:28 a.m. ET, followed by what appear to be security personnel and then his trial defense team.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlvin Bragg arrives at Trump trial\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg arrived at 9:21 a.m. ET. He took a seat in the first bench behind the prosecution trial team's table.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution team arrives in Trump trial\n\nMembers of the prosecution team entered the courtroom at 9:18 a.m. ET, including Matthew Colangelo, who delivered the team's opening statement yesterday. We are still waiting for the defense team and the judge.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors say he tried to cover up unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump falsely labeled checks to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as payments for legal services, when they were actually reimbursements for the $130,000 in hush money Cohen paid to Daniels, according to prosecutors. Trump has pleaded not guilty, and denies Daniels' claim that the pair had sex soon after Melania Trump gave birth to Trump son Barron.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat happened on Monday in the Trump trial?\n\nOn Monday, both the prosecution and defense delivered opening statements.\n\nThe prosecution portrayed the case as about a lot more than messing up some paperwork. \"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,\" said prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. \"It was election fraud, pure and simple.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche said his client is innocent. \"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,\" Blanche argued. Blanche also called former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen a liar, and said checks from Trump to Cohen weren't reimbursements for a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels – contrary to what the prosecution alleges.\n\nProsecution witness David Pecker, a former tabloid publisher, also began testifying.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWill the jury be sequestered in the Trump trial?\n\nNo. Although Judge Merchan has warned the media about reporting on some personally identifiable attributes of jurors, he has not decided to sequester them.\n\nDuring Trump's defamation trial with writer E. Jean Carroll earlier this year, the jury was sequestered from the public during trial breaks and transported to the courthouse by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to the Associated Press.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhat time does the Trump hush money trial start today?\n\nProceedings are expected to begin at 9:30 a.m. eastern time, starting with arguments on whether Trump violated gag orders.\n\nJurors were told Monday to return by 11:30 a.m. for testimony to resume.\n\nWho is David Pecker, the first witness in Donald Trump's trial?\n\nDavid Pecker is the former head of the tabloid the National Enquirer’s parent company American Media Inc. (AMI).\n\nPecker was president and CEO of AMI in August 2015, when he met with Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to “help deal with negative stories about Trump” by purchasing them and not publishing them, a practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nAMI paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her life story, including relationships with “any then-married man” but didn’t publish the story, according to records.\n\nQuestioning just scratched the surface when Pecker took the stand Monday. He described his duties at AMI and confirmed he had \"final say\" over publishing an article about a famous person.\n\n– Bart Jansen & Kinsey Crowley\n\nIs the Trump trial televised?\n\nNo. New York typically does not allow for audio or visual coverage in the courtroom.\n\nHowever, official transcripts of each day's proceedings will be published on the New York State Unified Court System's press website by the end of the following business day, officials announced Monday.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump Media stock price\n\nAt close on April 22, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp share price fell to $35.50, up slightly from open but down 2.42% from previous close.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\n10 gag order violations?\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy told Judge Juan Merchan last week that Trump has violated the judge's gag order at least 10 times, including by posting, \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nThe gag order forbids Trump from publicly commenting on jurors, as well as on potential witnesses' participation in the case. Trump lawyer Emil Bove said Thursday that Cohen has been attacking Trump, and the gag order doesn't forbid Trump from responding to political attacks.\n\nAfter just the first three alleged violations, Conroy asked Merchan to fine Trump $1,000 per violation – the maximum fine allowed – and to warn him \"that future violations can be punished with additional sanctions, including imprisonment.\" Conroy later updated Merchan that the prosecution documented another seven statements it believes were also violations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/25/donald-trump-trial-live-updates-hush-money-case-news/73445686007/", "title": "Trump hush money trial Day 7 recap: Pecker, Daniels, McDougal", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from Donald Trump's criminal trial on Thursday, April 25. For the latest news from Trump's hush money trial, read our live trial updates file for Friday, April 26.\n\nNEW YORK — David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, testified Thursday that his editor-in-chief believed porn star Stormy Daniels' allegation of an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nIn his testimony in Trump's New York criminal hush money trial about an alleged scheme to \"catch and kill\" stories that could embarrass Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Pecker also said Trump described Karen McDougal − a Playboy model who alleged an affair with Trump − as \"a nice girl.\" Trump denies both affair allegations.\n\nThe former president faces 34 charges of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made by his former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nAfter direct examination of Pecker concluded, Trump lawyer Emil Bove began cross-examining the magazine publisher.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nJudge and lawyers discussed Hope Hicks issue away from the jury\n\nAfter excusing the jurors, but before ending proceedings, Judge Juan Merchan discussed a trial issue with lawyers that is tied to a question from Trump lawyer Emil Bove about whether Hope Hicks was at a 2015 meeting involving David Pecker. Hicks was Trump's presidential campaign communications director for the 2016 election, and later served in Trump's White House.\n\nThe judge said Bove misled the jury by asking Pecker if a document would refresh Pecker's recollection about the Hicks issue, and then presenting Pecker with a document that, according to the judge, didn't contain something to refresh Pecker's recollection. The judge clarified he wasn't accusing Bove of deliberately misleading the jury, but will still address the issue with jurors tomorrow.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nThe Trump trial isn't televised, but you can read the transcripts and see the evidence\n\nNew York courts is publishing the transcripts of the proceedings and copies of the evidence shown to the jury.\n\nTranscripts of proceedings aren't always available, but officials decided to make them available due to \"unparalleled public interest.\"\n\nYou can catch up on Monday and Tuesday's proceedings on the New York State Unified Court System's media website.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump exits courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump exited the courtroom at 4:30 p.m. ET, after proceedings ended for the day.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge releases jurors and Pecker for evening after discussions with lawyers\n\nJudge Juan Merchan told jurors we will end proceedings for today, and has just released Pecker from the stand for the evening.\n\nThis is after many of the lawyers in the courtroom have been discussing legal issues privately with Merchan up at his bench, so proceedings aren't entirely wrapped up for the day.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nThe Trump trial isn't televised, but here's how you can read the transcripts\n\nNew York courts typically do not allow for cameras in the court room. But for Trump's hush money trial, transcripts will be published online daily.\n\nNew York courts is publishing the transcripts of the proceedings and copies of the evidence shown to the jury.

Prosecutors have alleged Trump falsified business records concerning a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in order to unlawfully interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That alleged purpose is one of the key theories from prosecutors for why the charges are felonies.\n\nThe defense may try to prove the hush money was for another purpose, such as shielding Trump's family from potentially embarrassing stories.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker asked about meetings with prosecutors\n\nPecker testified he has met with the prosecutors four or five times. The judge sustained an objection after Trump lawyer Emil Bove gave commentary, saying Pecker's estimate of four-to-five meetings sounds like a lot. Pecker also testified that prosecutors have always told him to tell the truth to the best of his ability.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker describes Tiger Woods leverage attempt\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove has been asking Pecker about a history of suppressing negative stories about celebrities. They discuss former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who came up earlier today. They also discuss Pecker buying a story about golf star Tiger Woods around 2007. Pecker bought the story not to run it, he said, but instead to get Woods to agree to appear on the cover of Men's Fitness and to also do an interview. The story material included Woods meeting a woman in a parking lot.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury appears attentive as witness testimony continues\n\nThe jurors have appeared very attentive throughout today's proceedings. Many of them are currently turning their heads back and forth in unison with Trump lawyer Emil Bove asking a question and David Pecker responding. Some are also taking notes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Emil Bove?\n\nEmil Bove is one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers, along with Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. Politico reported he joined the cohort in September 2023.\n\nBove is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n“Emil is an expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation and his trial skills are among the best in the business,” Blanche said in a statement provided to Politico.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove asks Pecker about old relationship with Trump\n\nTrump defense lawyer Emil Bove is cross-examining David Pecker. Pecker confirms he has known Trump for almost 40 years. Pecker confirms introducing Trump to John F. Kennedy Jr. at one point, as well as to George Pataki when Pataki was New York governor from 1995 to 2006.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I still consider him a friend': Pecker direct examination ends\n\nAsked if he has any bad feelings or ill will towards Trump, Pecker responded: \"On the contrary.\" He added: \"I felt that Donald Trump was my mentor, he helped me throughout my career.\"\n\nPecker told a story about Trump helping him after 9/11, when Pecker's office in Boca Raton, Florida was one of various magazine offices sent anthrax letters. One editor inhaled weaponized anthrax and died, and the FBI quarantined the building, leaving Pecker in a very difficult place both professionally and personally. Trump was \"very helpful,\" Pecker said. Trump recommended a lawyer, and introduced Pecker to someone from the insurance company that covered the building.\n\n\"Even though we haven't spoken, ... I still consider him a friend,\" Pecker said.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass ended his direct examination of Pecker, allowing the defense to start cross-examining him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump sent Pecker regards after last time they spoke\n\nPecker testified that he and Trump haven't spoken since January or February of 2019. Asked if Trump has tried to reach out since, Pecker replied: \"Not directly.\" Pecker added that he has friends who go to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, and \"he [Trump] would send his regards,\" but Pecker hasn't responded.\n\n\"I felt that, with the investigation that was going on at the same time, I thought it would be inappropriate,\" Pecker said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNational Enquirer parent company agreed not to contest campaign violation, Pecker says\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has been asking David Pecker about a conciliation agreement, which was separate from the non-prosecution agreement that American Media Inc. entered into with federal prosecutions. In the conciliation agreement, the company was agreeing not to contest that it committed a campaign violation, Pecker testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIn non-prosecution agreement, Pecker disclosed catch-and-kill scheme\n\nPecker read aloud a statement made as part of the non-prosecution agreement between federal prosecutors and The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. The company entered into the agreement to shield itself from prosecution on campaign finance violations.\n\nThe statement describes a history Pecker has now testified to in court, including agreeing to help Trump's campaign efforts by catching potential negative stories before they hit the press. It also describes the $150,000 hush money to Karen McDougal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker describes signing non-prosecution agreement\n\nPecker said that as part of a September 2018 non-prosecution agreement that American Media Inc. entered into with federal prosecutors, Pecker reviewed a statement of facts having to do with things Pecker says the company did for Trump ahead of the 2016 election. The agreement required the company and its representatives to cooperate and give truthful testimony and information. In return, it would be protected from criminal prosecution for campaign finance violations.\n\nAs part of that agreement, the company made several admissions, Pecker confirmed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump claimed Stormy Daniels owed him $24 million for Anderson Cooper interview: Pecker\n\nPecker testified that Trump called him and asked if he saw Stormy Daniels' interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Daniels did that interview after McDougal did an interview with Cooper.\n\nTrump told Pecker there was an agreement with Daniels that she cannot mention his name or do anything like this, and each time she breaches the agreement it's a $1 million penalty, Pecker testified. Trump added that, based on the Cooper interview, Daniels owed Trump $24 million.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump was 'very aggravated,' 'very upset' after McDougal's Anderson Cooper interview\n\nDavid Pecker said Trump called him and asked if he had seen an interview between CNN journalist Anderson Cooper and Karen McDougal. Pecker confirmed he had, and Trump said he thought there was an agreement that McDougal couldn't give interviews or be on television shows. Pecker said he amended it to allow her to speak to the press.\n\n\"Mr. Trump got very aggravated,\" Pecker testified. Trump couldn't understand why Pecker amended the agreement. Pecker told Trump McDougal was flooded with press requests for interviews, so he amended the agreement, even though he also paid her.\n\nTrump was \"very upset\" and couldn't understand why Pecker amended the agreement, Pecker testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I wanted her to remain within our family': Pecker lunch with McDougal\n\nPecker described having lunch with Karen McDougal. From his standpoint, the purpose was to make sure he and his company were compliant with their agreement with McDougal. Pecker said he wanted her to believe that because he wanted her not to speak to the press after the Wall Street Journal article that published soon before the 2016 election.\n\n\"I wanted her to remain within our family, I should say,\" Pecker testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLawyers and judge discuss more evidence issues\n\nThe jury hasn't been called into the courtroom yet because the lawyers and judge have been discussing whether a thread of text messages going up through October 2016 can be admitted in the trial. The messages are between former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard and a source of Howard's.\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove said the texts are too prejudicial against Trump. The texts haven't been shown to the audience. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said the texts relate to the \"core conspiracy\" regarding efforts to buy a story, and the jury can be instructed not to take every statement in the text chain as true.\n\nJudge Merchan didn't issue a ruling. He said he wants time to look at the texts closely, and has now called for the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump returns to courtroom ahead of late-afternoon testimony\n\nTrump re-entered the courtroom at 2:11 p.m. ET as we prepare for more testimony from David Pecker after the lunch break.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury excused for court break\n\nThe jury was excused for a break in proceedings at 1:00 p.m. ET.

During that walk, according to Pecker's testimony, Pecker told Trump that Cohen was very concerned about his bonus for the year and that Cohen has been very loyal and worked very hard. \"I believe he would throw himself under a bus for you,\" Pecker allegedly told Trump.\n\nTrump replied that he didn't know what Pecker was talking about – that Cohen had multiple apartments in Trump's buildings as well as taxi medallions. \"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it,\" Trump added, according to Pecker.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker discusses Wall Street Journal scoop on payment to McDougal\n\nPecker is being questioned about The Wall Street Journal's story days before the 2016 presidential election of the hush money for former Playboy model and alleged Trump paramour Karen McDougal's story.\n\nPecker said he authorized American Media Inc. to put out false statements in order to protect his company, himself, and Donald Trump.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nThe boss 'would be furious with me,' Cohen allegedly told Pecker\n\nAfter Pecker refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story, Cohen was upset and told Pecker the boss \"would be furious with me,\" Pecker testified.

He texted National Enquirer Editor Dylan Howard: \"We can't pay 120k.\"\n\nPecker explained on the stand that he was not a bank and had already put out hush money to Dino Sajudin and Karen McDougal to help Trump. He also said he didn't want to be involved with a porn star.\n\n\"Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there, and handle,\" Howard responded to Pecker, according to text messages displayed to the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'This story is true': Pecker gets message from Dylan Howard about Stormy Daniels\n\nThe jury has been shown text messages between former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard and David Pecker. A text from Howard said a woman wants $120,000. That woman was Stormy Daniels, Pecker testified.\n\nAccording to the displayed text messages, Howard texted Pecker: \"I know the denials were made in the past – but this story is true.\" Howard said the woman has offers from \"Mail\" and \"GMA.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIs the Trump trial available on TV or live stream?\n\nNo. New York typically does not allow for audio or visual coverage in the courtroom.\n\nHowever, official transcripts of each day's proceedings will be published on the New York State Unified Court System's press website by the end of the following business day, officials announced Monday.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nDavid Pecker describes call about Stormy Daniels story in testimony\n\nDavid Pecker has resumed his testimony.

Howard is unable to travel and come to the trial, according to earlier testimony from Pecker.\n\nIn one message, according to the prosecution, Howard texted: \"At least if he wins, I'll be pardoned for electoral fraud.\" He also allegedly texted: \"I get pardoned, so it's fine.\"\n\nJudge Juan Merchan tentatively ruled the texts couldn't come in because Trump's defense team wouldn't be able to conduct cross-examination about them. Merchan cited the right under the Constitution for criminal defendants to be confronted with witnesses against them.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Merchan addressing legal issues outside jury's presence\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is addressing legal issues with lawyers before the jury returns to the courtroom. The attorneys are making arguments about whether certain trial evidence prepared by prosecutors is admissible.

Trump exited the courtroom at 11:14 a.m. ET.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nUnlawful election interference? Pecker says McDougal hush money wasn't reported\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked David Pecker whether the hush money to Karen McDougal was reported as a campaign finance contribution. Pecker said it wasn't.\n\nAlthough only the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels is specifically tied to the records falsification charges Trump faces, this testimony could still be important. A key part of prosecutors' story is that the payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance laws. That makes it unlawful interference in the 2016 election, and makes Trump's alleged records falsification a cover-up for that unlawful interference, they say.\n\nFor Trump to be convicted of a felony, prosecutors must show not only that he falsified business records, but also that he did so to commit or conceal another crime. The federal campaign finance tie-in is one theory prosecutors have advanced to prove Trump committed a felony.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPecker says he never planned to publish McDougal story\n\nDavid Pecker said he never planned to publish Karen McDougal's story despite American Media Inc., which Pecker headed at the time, buying the rights to it.

Trump denies they had an affair. McDougal would get a monthly column in two different magazines, in addition to the $150,000, Pecker explained.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels and what is her real name?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election\n\n'The boss will take care of it'\n\nPecker testified about a discussion with Michael Cohen about who would ultimately pay the $150,000 hush money to Karen McDougal to keep her story of an affair with Trump quiet ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Cohen allegedly told Pecker not to worry, \"the boss will take care of it.\" Pecker testified he understood that to mean he would be reimbursed either by the Trump Organization or Donald Trump.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price\n\nAt open on April 25, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp shares rose to $37, up 3.73% from the previous close.\n\nAt close on Tuesday, Trump Media met the requirement to issue 36 million additional shares to Trump in an earnout bonus, worth $1.17 billion at the time.\n\n'Karen is a nice girl,' Trump allegedly said about woman who claims they had affair\n\nDavid Pecker is testifying about Karen McDougal's story of having an affair with Trump, and his communications with Trump and Michael Cohen about it. McDougal has claimed they had an affair that overlapped with Melania Trump's pregnancy. Trump denies the claim.\n\n\"I spoke to Michael. Karen is a nice girl,\" Trump said to Pecker during a phone call, Pecker testified. Pecker said that comment made him believe Trump knew who McDougal was. Trump asked what Pecker thought he should do, according to Pecker. Pecker recommended Trump buy McDougal's story and take it off the market.\n\nAsked by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass why Pecker thought Trump should buy the story, Pecker testified he believed her story was true, and he thought it would have been very embarrassing for Trump personally as well as for Trump's campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution argues Trump has violated gag order another four times\n\nJudge Juan Merchan hasn't yet ruled on whether to hold Trump in criminal contempt for allegedly violating a gag order. But prosecutor Christopher Conroy said this morning, just before prosecution witness David Pecker re-took the stand, that Trump has again been violating the order.\n\nConroy pointed to multiple comments by Trump to the press, including calling potential key witness Michael Cohen a \"convicted liar\" who \"did some pretty bad things, I guess.\"\n\nConroy said just this morning Trump commented on Pecker as well. \"David's been very nice,\" Trump said, according to Conroy. \"This is a message to Pecker: Be nice,\" Trump allegedly said. \"It's a message to others.

We're still waiting for former President Trump and his trial team, as well as for Judge Juan Merchan.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCould Supreme Court presidential immunity arguments impact Trump's New York case?\n\nEarly this month, Judge Juan Merchan rejected an argument from Trump to delay the New York criminal trial until after the Supreme Court rules on the scope of presidential immunity in Trump's federal election interference case. Merchan said Trump raised the immunity defense in his New York case too late.\n\nIf Trump is found guilty in the New York criminal trial, he could challenge Merchan's immunity ruling on appeal, and potentially point to a Supreme Court immunity ruling as a basis for re-trying the New York case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy isn't Trump at Supreme Court arguments?\n\nNew York trial Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request from former President Donald Trump's legal team last week to allow Trump to attend today's Supreme Court arguments over whether he is immune from prosecution in his federal election interference case. The high court is reviewing whether a former president can be prosecuted for official presidential acts.\n\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal,\" Merchan said. He added that he understood Trump's desire to be at those arguments, but wouldn't alter the criminal trial plans for them.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nDonald Trump is 77 years old. He will turn 78 on June 14, 2024.\n\nTrump was 70 years old when he was inaugurated into office in 2017.\n\nJoe Biden is 81 years old, the first octogenarian president.

For the latest news from Trump's hush money trial, keep up with live updates from the courtroom on Tuesday, April 23.\n\nNEW YORK — The heart of former President Donald Trump's New York hush money trial, overseen by Judge Juan Merchan, kicked off on Monday with opening statements and witness testimony.\n\nMatthew Colangelo delivered the opening argument for the prosecution, alleging that the former president's actions were \"election fraud, pure and simple.\" Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, criticized accounts from Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn star Stormy Daniels, telling the jury \"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election.\"\n\nJurors are deciding whether Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment from Cohen to Daniels.\n\nTrump authorized the payment in order to keep Daniels from hurting his 2016 presidential campaign by going public with her story that the pair had sex, according to the prosecutors. Trump denies Daniels' claim and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDavid Pecker, the former head of the National Enquirer’s parent company, was the first witness called to the stand in the case. He's expected to face further questions about how the company routinely paid for scandalous stories that it didn’t publish, under what others called a “catch-and-kill” strategy.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courthouse:\n\nDonald Trump insists payments were ‘legal expense’ rather than attempt to affect 2016 campaign\n\nAfter a morning of opening arguments by prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump’s hush money trial, the former president gave his own eight-minute summary to reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom.\n\nTrump is charged with falsifying business records to pay hush money to silence women before the 2016 election. But he insisted that his payments to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, were correctly marked as legal expenses rather than what prosecutors contend were a reimbursement for the $130,000 paid to porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump said Cohen was imprisoned for other charges dealing with taxi medallions and tax fraud. But Cohen also pleaded guilty to a campaign finance violation for the payment to Daniels. Trump repeated that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s predecessor and federal prosecutors investigated him and declined to prosecute.\n\n“This is what I got indicted for?” Trump asked. “It’s very unfair.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump exits courtroom after day 5 of hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump exited the courtroom at 12:43 p.m. ET. Proceedings will resume Tuesday with arguments over whether Trump has violated Judge Juan Merchan's gag order.\n\nThose will be held in the morning outside the presence of the jury. Jurors have been instructed that proceedings involving them will start at 11:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, and will end at 2 p.m. ET in light of the Passover holiday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is ‘catch-and-kill’?\n\nThe National Enquirer, a tabloid, routinely paid sources for stories and sometimes refused to publish them, under what prosecutors and witnesses in the Donald Trump hush money trial called a “catch-and-kill” strategy.\n\nThe publication’s parent company, American Media Inc., denied a catch-and-kill policy after The Wall Street Journal revealed a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed a year-long affair with Trump, without ever publishing the story.\n\nBut instead, the company put her picture on a couple of magazine covers and had her write a few fitness columns.\n\nAMI later acknowledged spending more than was routine to block McDougal’s story because the company expected to be reimbursed by Trump. The silencing of derogatory stories before the 2016 election is at the heart of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s charges against Trump that he falsified business records to pay hush money.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nLawyers, Judge Juan Merchan talk over lingering trial issues\n\nAlthough jurors have left for the day, lawyers and the judge are continuing to discuss trial issues, including instructions the judge should give when lawyers introduce newspaper articles later in trial. Trump lawyer Emil Bove also raised concerns about \"hearsay\" coming into trial that's tied to Dylan Howard, a former editor of The National Enquirer who is unable to travel and come to the trial, according to earlier testimony.\n\n\"Hearsay\" is a technical legal term referring to statements that were made outside a courtroom but are introduced in court in order to prove the truth of what was said. Such statements are prohibited unless they fall into specific exceptions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors excused for rest of day\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said proceedings would need to wrap up for the rest of the day. He earlier said they would need to end by 12:30 p.m. ET for an alternate juror's emergency appointment over a toothache. The jurors have exited the courtroom. The lawyers have approached Merchan's bench for a private conversation.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor asks Pecker about former National Enquirer editor, 'juicy stories'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Pecker about Dylan Howard, who was once the editor of The National Enquirer. Howard now lives in Australia and has a health condition that prevents him from traveling, to the best of Pecker's knowledge, Pecker said. Pecker confirmed Howard would run \"juicy stories\" by Pecker.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump listening intently to David Pecker testimony\n\nDonald Trump has his arms on the table in front of him and is leaning his body forward slightly as he faces David Pecker directly.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy is David Pecker tied to Donald Trump's hush money case? Publisher says he had 'final say' as former head of tabloid publisher\n\nPecker is describing his responsibilities when he was chairman, president, and CEO of American Media Inc. or \"AMI,\" which owns The National Enquirer and other publications. He worked there from 1999 to 2020.\n\nPecker described having say over what would get published, including approving expenditures. He confirmed prosecutor Joshua Steinglass' statement that he would have \"final say\" over whether to publish an article involving a famous person.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavid Pecker called to the stand\n\nWe have gotten our first witness in the case: David Pecker, a tabloid publisher. Prosecutors have alleged Pecker was a key member of a \"catch-and-kill\" conspiracy involving Donald Trump to prevent stories that could hurt his 2016 presidential campaign from becoming public.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump returns to courtroom\n\nDonald Trump returned to the courtroom at 12:01 p.m. ET, trailed by members of his defense team. Judge Juan Merchan just asked for jurors to be brought into the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan enters courtroom\n\nJuan Merchan re-entered the courtroom at about noon ET. Prosecutors are also in the courtroom. We are waiting for Trump and his defense team to return.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump leaves the courtroom\n\nTrump exited the courtroom at about 11:50 a.m. ET for a short break in proceedings.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer ends opening statement\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche ended his opening statement by telling the jurors to \"use your common sense.\" He added: \"We're New Yorkers.\"\n\nBlanche reminded jurors they promised to put aside any views they have about Trump and decide the case based on the evidence presented in the trial. If they do that, there will be a \"very swift\" not guilty verdict for Trump, Blanche claimed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer and prosecutors argue over Cohen's alleged lies\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche began telling jurors that Michael Cohen has lied multiple times under oath. But prosecutors objected and there was just a private conversation at the judge's bench. \"The objection is sustained,\" Judge Juan Merchan said.\n\nBlanche then told jurors they will learn Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying under oath. There was no objection – Merchan appears to be allowing that statement to the jurors.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2018.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMichael Cohen 'has a goal, an obsession, with getting Trump,' lawyer for Trump says\n\nTodd Blanche in his opening statement has been focusing on Michael Cohen, a potentially key witness for prosecutors.\n\nMichael Cohen \"has misrepresented key conversations, where the only witness who was present for the conversation was Mr. Cohen and allegedly President Trump,\" Blanche told the jurors.\n\n\"He has a goal, an obsession, with getting Trump, and you're going to hear that,\" Blanche added. \"I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump's lawyer says Stormy Daniels' claims are \"false\" in dramatic moment\n\nWhether Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump actually had sex may be beside the point in this case, which deals with whether Trump falsified business records to cover up an attempt to unlawfully interfere with the 2016 election through the hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nBut Trump lawyer Todd Blanche still took his time in emphasizing Trump denies Daniels' claim. Paying Daniels for her agreement to not publicly spread \"false – false – claims\" about Trump isn't illegal, Blanche told the jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer: 'There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.'\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told the jurors. Blanche added that prosecutors have put a \"sinister\" spin on this, as if it's a crime, but jurors will learn it's not.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDefense lawyer denies Donald Trump was reimbursing Michael Cohen for Stormy Daniels hush money\n\nDonald Trump's defense is beginning to take shape. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said a series of payments Trump sent to Michael Cohen weren't payback for Cohen paying porn star Stormy Daniels hush money.\n\nThat contradicts prosecutors, who say they were reimbursement payments. Blanche said Cohen was Trump's personal attorney. According to prosecutors, Trump falsely labeled his checks to Cohen as being for legal services.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump is now looking over in direction of jurors and lawyer\n\nDonald Trump largely looked forward as prosecutor Matthew Colangelo delivered an opening statement to Trump's right, in the direction of the jurors who are also to Trump's right.\n\nNow that Trump lawyer Todd Blanche is addressing jurors, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has turned his body and face toward his right, facing the jurors often and sometimes turning his head to see Blanche, who is standing both to Trump's right and slightly behind him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'He's a husband. He's a father. He's a person': Trump lawyer addresses jurors\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said his team will refer to Trump as \"President Trump\" throughout the trial out of respect for the office he held. Blanche added about his client: \"He's also a man. He's a husband. He's a father. He's a person, just like you and just like me.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'President Trump is innocent': Trump lawyer begins opening statement\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Trump's defense lawyer said to begin his opening statement on behalf of the former president.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution ends opening statement in Trump hush money case\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo ended his opening statement by alleging Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMichael Cohen's testimony will be 'backed up by Donald Trump's own words,' prosecutor says\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors Michael Cohen's testimony in the trial will be backed up by a paper trail that includes phone logs and business documents. It will be \"backed up by Donald Trump's own words on tape, in social media posts, in his own books, and in video of his own speeches,\" Colangelo added.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWill the jury be sequestered in the Trump trial?\n\nNo. While Merchan has cautioned the media to refrain from reporting on some personally identifiable attributes of jurors, he has not decided to sequester the jury.\n\nDuring Trump's defamation trial earlier this year, the jury was sequestered from the public during breaks and transported to the courthouse by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to the Associated Press.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump not looking at prosecutor during prosecutor's opening\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo is standing at a lectern to the right and slightly behind former President Donald Trump. The lectern is facing the jurors on the right side of the courtroom. Trump has been looking forward through most of the statement, rather than at Colangelo or the jury.\n\nTrump has a screen in front of him that shows live video feeds of the proceedings from different vantage points. He has shaken his head at least once so far during the prosecution's opening. He has also leaned over to communicate with his lawyer, Todd Blanche, at least twice.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor: 'It was election fraud, pure and simple.'\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo described the alleged scheme to buy porn star Stormy Daniels' story for $130,000 in order to keep it from American voters: \"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" Colangelo alleged.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutors describe flurries of calls surrounding release of scandalous stories\n\nYears before Donald Trump’s trial, FBI investigators uncovered flurries of calls between his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and National Enquirer executives when scandalous stories were breaking.\n\nOne cluster of calls happened Oct. 8, 2016, the day after The Washington Post released the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, while negotiations were under way to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nCohen called David Pecker, CEO of the National Enquirer’s parent company, briefly at 7:39 p.m. and again four minutes later. Then Cohen got a call from Dylan Howard, the company’s chief content officer. After conferring with a Trump spokesperson, Cohen got a call from Pecker and then called Trump. Cohen got two more calls from Howard at 8:39 p.m. and 8:57 p.m.\n\nAnother group of calls erupted Nov. 4, 2016, before The Wall Street Journal reported the National Enquirer paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, for her story about the affair and never published it.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nJurors hear Stormy Daniels' story of affair with Donald Trump\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo is now describing to jurors the effort to buy the rights to porn star Stormy Daniels' story of an affair with Trump (Trump denies her story).\n\nCohen sent a $130,000 payment to Daniels' lawyer to kill the story before the 2016 election, Colangelo says. \"Cohen made that payment at Donald Trump's direction and for his benefit,\" he tells the jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump asks 'So what do we gotta pay for this, 150?' on tape, prosecutor says\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors about a recorded conversation in which Cohen and Trump are discussing McDougal's story. He said the jurors will hear Trump in his own voice on the tape saying, \"So what do we gotta pay for this, 150?\"\n\nCohen recorded the conversation to show David Pecker that Trump planned to pay him back for buying McDougal's story, Colangelo said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPlayboy model's catch-and-kill story\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo is describing a \"catch-and-kill\" effort to secure the story of former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump – a claim Trump denies.\n\nPecker agreed to have his company pay McDougal $150,000 to keep her quiet. The core reason for the payment was to keep the story from hurting Trump's presidential campaign, Colangelo said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Matthew Colangelo, the prosecutor starting off opening arguments?\n\nMatthew Colangelo, who is starting off the prosecution’s opening arguments, joined the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in December 2022 after serving as a senior official at the Justice Department in Washington.\n\nColangelo, who was the former acting Associate Attorney General at DOJ, specialized in housing & tenant protection, labor & worker protection and white-collar investigations at the DA’s office.\n\n“Matthew Colangelo brings a wealth of economic justice experience combined with complex white-collar investigations, and he has the sound judgment and integrity needed to pursue justice against powerful people and institutions when they abuse their power,” DA Alvin Bragg said at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nProsecutor describes three-pronged conspiracy to interfere with 2016 election\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo described to jurors a meeting between Donald Trump, his former lawyer Michael Cohen, and a tabloid publisher, David Pecker. The three agreed to a three-pronged conspiracy to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, Colangelo said:\n\nPecker would be the campaign's \"eyes and ears,\" reporting potentially harmful information to Cohen, who would work to keep it quiet. Colangelo described this as the \"core\" of the conspiracy.\n\nPecker would publish flattering stories about Trump.\n\nPecker would use his publications to attack Trump's political opponents.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up': Opening statements begin in Trump's hush money trial\n\n\"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,\" said Matthew Colangelo, in beginning his opening statement for the prosecution.\n\nColangelo continued by telling jurors that Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, and covered it up by lying in his New York business records \"over and over and over again.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIf Trump testifies, prosecutors can inform jurors of Trump civil fraud case, E. Jean Carroll defamation trial\n\nBefore jurors entered the courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan said that, should Trump testify, prosecutors would be able to inform jurors that Trump was found liable for violating state law by fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. That determination ties to his civil fraud case, in which Trump is appealing a $454 million judgment against him.\n\nMerchan also said prosecutors could inform jurors that Trump was found liable for defaming New York writer E. Jean Carroll, even though Merchan didn't indicate they can inform jurors about Trump's liability for sexually abusing Carroll.\n\nMerchan also said prosecutors can inform jurors that Trump was found to have violated a gag order twice in his civil fraud case. And prosecutors will be allowed to inform jurors of an agreement that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved as a result of an investigation into self-dealing transactions.\n\nIf Trump testifies and prosecutors seek to introduce those determinations, jurors will be instructed to only consider the determinations when it comes to evaluating Trump's credibility.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors not permitted to speak to others about the case\n\nJudge Juan Merchan instructed the jurors that they are not permitted to speak with others about the case because only they are authorized to decide the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors instructed on how to approach deliberations at end of trial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is giving jurors extensive instructions on the trial and their role within it. He tells them not to be influenced by stereotypes or implicit biases, including when it comes to political affiliation.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDaniels sued to cancel the non-disclosure agreement signed 11 days before the election, which was dismissed in 2020 She also sued Trump for defamation in 2018 over some of his tweets, but that lawsuit was also thrown out.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that was designed to unlawfully interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe payment was made by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and violated federal campaign finance laws, according to prosecutors. They say Trump authorized the payment to help his presidential campaign, and falsified records to cover up the checks he sent to reimburse Cohen for the hush money.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWill the Trump trial be televised or live streamed?\n\nNo.\n\nNew York court rules state that audio-visual coverage of trials is not permitted unless a representative of the news media submits an application and the judge allows it, which has not happened for this trial.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley & Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge indicates prosecutors can't tell jurors about E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse case\n\nBefore the jurors entered, Judge Juan Merchan ruled that prosecutors will be able to inform jurors of six legal determinations against Trump if he chooses to testify. However, Merchan didn't mention a jury's determination in a civil case that Trump sexually abused New York writer E. Jean Carroll, indicating that determination won't be allowed in the criminal case. Trump denies Carroll's claim.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors enter the courtroom\n\nThe jurors entered the courtroom at about 9:55 a.m. ET. Judge Merchan is instructing them on how things will unfold, including his plan to give them introductory instructions that will last about 30 minutes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price\n\nAt open on April 22, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp share price fell to $35, down 3.79% from previous close\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDonald Trump attacks officials over hush money trial without offering proof\n\nDonald Trump sharply criticized the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office on Monday morning as opening arguments were set to get underway, telling reporters that the hush money case against him amounts to unfair election “interference.”\n\n“Everybody knows it,” Trump said outside of court, claiming that the trial is preventing him from being on the campaign trail.”\n\n“Fortunately, the poll numbers are very good. They've been going up because people understand what's going on. It's a witch hunt and it's a shame. And it comes out of Washington,” Trump said, without offering any proof.\n\nThere is no indication that anyone in Washington, including the Biden administration, has played any role in the first criminal prosecution of Trump on charges of paying hush money to two women just before the 2016 election who claimed to have had sex with him.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nWho is Judge Juan Merchan? What to know as Donald Trump's hush money trial continues\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is presiding over the first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history. Donald Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the hush money payments issued to Stormy Daniels.\n\nMerchan has been a felony judge for 15 years.\n\nBefore that, Merchan served as an assistant attorney general for Nassau County, on suburban Long Island, and in the Manhattan district attorney’s office for five years.\n\nHe received his bachelor’s degree is from Baruch College and his law degree is from Hofstra University.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nJuror #9 will remain in trial despite expressing concern over media\n\nJudge Merchan announced that Juror #9, who expressed concern about continuing due to media attention, will remain in the trial. Merchan just met with the juror outside the courtroom.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror expressed concern about continuing due to media attention\n\nA juror called the court expressing concern about attending the trial due to media attention, but the juror is here today, Judge Juan Merchan said. Merchan and members from each legal team are currently meeting with the juror outside the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt to end early at 12:30 p.m. ET due to alternate juror toothache\n\nJudge Merchan announced court will be ending at 12:30 p.m. ET today because an alternate juror needs to get to an emergency appointment due to a toothache. Court was already scheduled to end early at 2 p.m. ET today and tomorrow for the Passover holiday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Merchan enters the courtroom\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 9:31 a.m. ET.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump enters the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom at 9:26 a.m. ET.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty? Will he go to prison?\n\nIf Donald Trump is convicted on all counts in his New York criminal hush money trial that started last week, he could theoretically face more than a decade in prison.\n\nBut most legal experts who spoke to USA TODAY said such a dramatic outcome is unlikely. Instead, he would likely be sentenced to something between probation and four years in prison.\n\nAnd he would probably still be out, free to campaign for president as the presumptive or actual 2024 Republican nominee, while his all-but-certain appeal was pending.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump enters NY courthouse\n\nDonald Trump has entered the Manhattan courthouse as the second week of his hush money trial begins\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is hush money?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho are Donald Trump's lawyers?\n\nTrump's defense team is led by Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.\n\nBlanche was a federal prosecutor for nine years in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. As a prominent white-collar defense lawyer he has defended Trump advisor Boris Epshteyn and Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nNecheles is ranked among the top criminal defense lawyers in New York by the legal rating and head-hunting firm Chambers and Partners. She was also a former counsel to Venero Mangano, the former Genovese crime family underboss known as Benny Eggs..\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nIs the Trump trial being televised?\n\nNo, the trial won't be televised or available to watch online or aired on TV.\n\nNew York court rules state that audio-visual coverage of trials is not permitted unless a representative of the news media submits an application and the judge allows it.\n\nRecords show an application was submitted to cover the arraignment, but not the trial. Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request to televise the arraignment.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump. Cohen funneled the money through the National Enquirer under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nThe National Enquirer, owned by American Media Inc., was fined $187,500 by the Federal Election Commission for paying McDougal $150,000 for exclusive rights to her story with the intent of influencing the election. McDougal also sued the company. She has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for 10 months starting in 2006.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nHow long will Trump's trial last?\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial that begins Monday in Manhattan could last as long as eight weeks.\n\nIt is the first time a former president has been criminally charged, although Trump has now also been charged in three other criminal cases in other jurisdictions for attempting to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents after leaving office.\n\nIn New York, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for allegedly disguising hush money payments issued to porn star Stormy Daniels.

Here's what to know about the first witness in Donald Trump's trial\n\nDavid Pecker, the former head of the National Enquirer’s parent company, is expected to be the first witness in Donald Trump’s hush money trial about how the company routinely paid for scandalous stories that it didn’t publish, under what others called a “catch-and-kill” strategy.\n\nPecker was president and CEO of American Media Inc. (AMI) in August 2015, when he met with Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to “help deal with negative stories about Trump” by purchasing them and not publishing them, according to a Federal Election Commission agreement with the company.\n\nAfter a lawyer for Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed an affair with Trump, contacted the company, Pecker and Dylan Howard, the company’s vice president and chief content officer, notified Cohen, according to the FEC agreement.\n\nIn August 2016, the company McDougal $150,000 for her life story, including about any relationship with “any then-married man” and then didn’t publish the story, according to the FEC agreement.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWonder what it would be like to watch the Trump trial?

James is arguing that Trump hasn't demonstrated he provided enough collateral to truly back up the bond, which was provided by Knight Specialty Insurance Company.\n\nThe Knight company is owned by self-proclaimed Trump supporter and California billionaire Don Hankey.\n\nAn appeal bond functions as a guarantee that a judgment will be paid once the appeal is over, at least in the amount of the bond. A New York appeals court allowed Trump and his co-defendants to post just $175 million, instead of the full $464 million judgment they face – all but $10 million of which Trump faces personally.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/17/trump-hush-money-trial-setbacks/73355556007/", "title": "How Trump's hush money trial already looks rocky for former president", "text": "Former President Donald Trump suffered a series of setbacks on the first two days of his historic New York criminal trial, in which he faces 34 felony counts that carry a potential prison sentence.\n\nProsecutors say Trump falsified business records to conceal a hush money payment that was designed to unlawfully interfere with the 2016 election. Trump allegedly authorized his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make the payment to porn star Stormy Daniels out of fear her story of a sexual encounter with Trump would hurt his standing with women voters. The payment violated federal campaign finance laws, according to prosecutors.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies Daniels' claim.\n\nJury selection, which Trump has suggested is not giving him a fair shot, will continue when the trial resumes on Thursday.\n\nTrump trial live updates:David Pecker expected to be first witness in hush money trial\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere are six bits of bad news for Trump from Monday and Tuesday:\n\nSetback #1: Trump loses motion for judge's recusal\n\nTrump's trial technically only started when jury selection got underway in the afternoon on Monday. But even before that, court proceedings didn't go well for him.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan opened the day by denying Trump's motion for the judge's recusal. Trump argued that Merchan should be off the case because his daughter leads a marketing agency that does work for Democratic political candidates.\n\nMerchan noted the determination of the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that the judge's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on the daughter's work because Trump's case doesn't involve her business. The judge already denied a similar motion back in August.\n\n\"The court will not address this matter further,\" Merchan said Monday.\n\nSetback #2: The trial started\n\nThe mere fact that the trial started was a loss for Trump. He submitted a flurry of court filings in the days and weeks before trial seeking to delay proceedings. Three separate New York appellate judges denied three separate emergency appeals by Trump that were seeking delay.\n\nMerchan also denied Trump's motions for delay based on pre-trial publicity and based on the fact that the Supreme Court will hear arguments over Trump's presidential immunity claims in a separate case later this month.\n\nSetback #3: Trump could be held in contempt over gag order\n\nProsecutors on Monday asked Merchan to hold Trump in contempt, fine him $3,000, and warn him that he could face jail time for future violations. Merchan is going to hold a hearing on the issue next Tuesday.\n\nThe reason? Prosecutors allege Trump violated Merchan's gag order against him at least three times. The order prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case.\n\nIn issuing that order, Merchan cited a history of Trump making \"inflammatory\" out-of-court statements that instilled fear in people involved in Trump's legal cases and increased security needs. Such statements \"undoubtedly risk impeding the orderly administration of this Court,\" according to the March 26 order.\n\nProsecutors highlighted a Trump Truth Social post on Saturday stating: \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\" They also pointed to an April 10 post calling Cohen and Daniels \"sleaze bags.\"\n\nTrump's team asked to respond to the allegations in writing, and the judge gave them a deadline of Friday to do so.\n\nSetback #4: Judge admonishes Trump\n\nAs a former president and head of a real estate business empire, Trump might not be used to being admonished by someone more powerful in the room. But that's essentially what happened to him on Tuesday, after Trump's lawyer questioned a potential juror about a video the Trump trial team found on social media that was tied to her and filmed an anti-Trump event.\n\nAfter the prospective juror left the courtroom, Merchan said he heard Trump making comments while the woman was there, although he couldn't hear what Trump actually said.\n\n\"I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,\" Merchan told Trump lawyer Todd Blanche. \"Speak to your client,\" Merchan instructed.\n\nBlanche leaned over and whispered to Trump, who then leaned forward at the defense table.\n\nSetback #5: Trump not happy with jury selection?\n\nWhen Merchan denied Trump's delay request based on pre-trial publicity, he said the right way to address Trump's concerns was to have a \"thorough, thoughtful and effective\" process of questioning potential jurors.\n\nEach side has been given 10 \"peremptory strikes\" they can use in the selection process. Those essentially work as vetoes over potential jurors that can be used for almost any reason. Once a side runs out of strikes, they have to take the next potential juror who comes unless the judge disqualifies the person. By the end of Tuesday, both sides had used six of their strikes.\n\nIt's possible the Trump team is happy with how the selection process has panned out so far.\n\nBut Trump didn't seem pleased when he posted on his Truth Social media platform Wednesday, which was an off-day in the trial.\n\n\"I thought STRIKES were supposed to be 'unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,\" he posted.\n\nSetback #6: Caught snoozing\n\nTrump is famously image-conscious, and he has frequently mocked opponents for supposedly lacking vigor, from \"low energy\" Jeb Bush to President \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden. So he might have found it embarrassing when multiple reporters said he appeared to be falling asleep in the courtroom.\n\nTrump glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds on Monday afternoon, after she reported earlier that she saw his head repeatedly drop down and his mouth go slack. Haberman has a long history of reporting on Trump, including through her 2022 book, \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/02/donald-trump-trial-live-updates-news-hush-money-case/73530967007/", "title": "Trump trial recap: Stormy Daniels' lawyer takes the stand in hush ...", "text": "Editor's note: This file reflects the new from Donald Trump's New York trial on Thursday, May 2. For the latest news from Trump's hush money trial, please follow our live updates from inside the courtroom for Friday, May 3.\n\nNEW YORK — The 10th day of Donald Trump's hush money trial saw testimony from a pivotal attorney and an analyst as the former president continues to face sweeping criminal charges in New York.\n\nThe day began with a hearing over whether Trump has again violated a gag order, followed by more testimony on porn star Stormy Daniels' hush money deal. Judge Juan Merchan already held Trump in criminal contempt Tuesday after concluding Trump committed nine gag order violations.\n\nLater, Keith Davidson, the former lawyer for both Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in their hush money deals, retook the witness stand. Davidson testified that he believes he prepared Daniels' denial in early 2018 of an affair with Trump in The Wall Street Journal, and that the denial was technically accurate because it referred to a sexual or romantic \"relationship,\" rather than merely an encounter.\n\nSignificantly for the prosecution, Davidson also texted \"What have we done?\" to National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard on the night of the 2016 presidential election, because he believed his actions had aided Trump's campaign.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe day ended with computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus on the witness stand. During Daus' testimony, the prosecution played an audio recording between Trump and Cohen, in which they appeared to be discussing a hush money deal.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump now suggests he won't testify; blames gag order\n\nAs he left the courthouse, Trump suggested he would not testify in the hush money trial because of the gag order imposed on him, even though one decision has nothing to do with the other.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to testify; I'm under a gag order ... I guess, right?\" Trump told reporters.\n\nTrump also noted that he has appealed the gag order, which does not preclude testimony in open court.\n\nTrump also complained that the gag order inhibits his presidential campaign, and that he is required to attend the trial.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCourt proceedings end for Thursday\n\nJudge Juan Merchan called an end to Thursday's proceedings while computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus was still on the stand. Merchan also said proceedings will end slightly early on Friday, at about 3:45 p.m. or 4:00 p.m. EDT, due to an issue with a juror's schedule.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove cross-examining forensic analyst\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy ended his questioning of computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus, and Trump lawyer Emil Bove has begun cross-examining Daus.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump asking about 'financing' hush money deal on Cohen audio recording?\n\nThe prosecution played an audio recording of a conversation between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, which prosecutors want the jury to believe showed the pair discussing one of the hush money deals tied to Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen said on the recording that he needed to open up a company for the transfer of all of that information \"regarding our friend, David.\"\n\nProsecutors appear to be suggesting \"David\" refers to \"David Pecker,\" a former tabloid executive who has already testified to his involvement in hush money deals to help the 2016 Trump campaign. In his opening statement, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo described the call, which also features Trump asking: \"So, what do we got to pay for this? 150?\" Cohen recorded the call to reassure Pecker that Trump planned to pay the company Pecker headed back for the $150,000 hush money deal with McDougal, according to Colangelo.\n\nCohen also says on the recording that he has spoken with Allen Weisselberg about how to set it up. Weisselberg used to be the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, and is currently incarcerated for lying in Trump's civil fraud trial in away that supported Trump's defense. \"I'm all over that,\" Cohen adds.\n\nCohen then brings up \"financing\" and Trump responds: \"What financing?\" \"We'lI have to pay,\" Cohen says.\n\nThe recording was cut off soon after that statement.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nForensic expert describes information on Michael Cohen's phone\n\nComputer forensic analyst Douglas Daus is testifying about various items or pieces of information pulled from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's phone. One item was a photo of Cohen, who appeared to be in the White House press briefing room at the time. Daus also described contact information for various people in Trump's orbit, such as Melania Trump and the Trump 2016 campaign's press secretary, Hope Hicks. Some of the information could be used to bolster Cohen's testimony, if the prosecution calls him to the stand. Hicks is also a potential witness in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFact check: Does Trump simply have closed eyes in courtroom?\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social today that he doesn't fall asleep in the courtroom, but instead just closes his \"beautiful blue eyes\" sometimes as he listens \"intensely.\"\n\nIt's true I've seen him multiple times have his eyes closed for extended periods in the courtroom even when he appears to be awake, including today. On April 26, he had his eyes closed as I counted to 107, with a \"Mississippi\" in between each number, even though he would occasionally give a slight facial expression or shift his head from left to right.\n\nBut I saw him appear sleepy, if not fully asleep, during jury selection on April 19. He dropped his head down repeatedly before lifting it back up, and at one point his mouth went agape as his eyes were closed.\n\nOther reporters have seen similar behavior as well.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I simply close my beautiful blue eyes,' Trump says on Truth Social\n\nIn another court claim that is likely to be contested, Trump denies that he has occasionally fallen asleep during this trial.\n\n\"I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes, listen intensely, and take it ALL in!!!\" Trump posted on this Truth Social website.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump has eyes closed for extended periods again\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has his eyes closed for extended periods again at this trial, although he doesn't appear to be falling asleep at the moment. I counted to 15 \"Mississippis\" just now before he briefly opened his eyes. He quickly closed them again.\n\nThe testimony right now is fairly dry, as computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus describes his background and expertise.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nComputer forensic analyst testifying\n\nQuestioning of Keith Davidson ended, and prosecutor Christopher Conroy called a new witness, Douglas Daus, to the witness stand. Daus said he has worked in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for almost ten years. He said he works in a high-technology analysis unit as a supervising computer forensic analyst.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I hate the fact that we did it,' Trump allegedly said on Stormy Daniels deal\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Davidson about a comment by Michael Cohen in a conversation with Davidson, which Davidson said Cohen secretly recorded: \"I hate the fact that we did it.\" Davidson said he understood that to be a comment Cohen was saying Trump made when speaking about the settlement with Stormy Daniels.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury hearing recorded conversation between Davidson and Cohen\n\nThe jury is hearing a conversation between Davidson and Michael Cohen that Davidson said Cohen recorded \"surreptitiously.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels wasn't the one who said election was 'leverage' in hush money deal: Davidson\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove's questioning of Davidson left the impression that Stormy Daniels may have said the 2016 presidential election was leverage in her hush money deal. But Davidson confirmed in response to a question by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass that someone else suggested that.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson questioned by prosecutor again\n\nDavidson is being questioned again by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass through a process known as \"re-direct,\" where the side in a legal case that called a witness gets to question the witness again, after the witness has been cross-examined.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCross-examination of Davidson ends\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove ended his cross-examination of Keith Davidson somewhat abruptly. He noted toward the end that an agreement in the Stormy Daniels hush money deal had a blank signature spot for \"David Dennison,\" the pseudonym used for Donald Trump.\n\nDavidson spent much of his cross-examination focused on Davidson's deals for clients over his career, which Bove suggested at least raised extortion concerns, regardless of whether they violated extortion laws. He later applied that line of questioning to the Stormy Daniels deal, suggesting the 2016 presidential election was used as leverage to get the hush money.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Sometimes people get settler's remorse': Davidson on Stormy Daniels\n\nAt Trump lawyer Emil Bove's prompting, Davidson listened to a recording of a conversation he had with Michael Cohen. Davidson confirmed he said in the conversation, \"Sometimes people get settler's remorse.\" Bove asked if that was a conversation about Stormy Daniels. Davidson expressed some uncertainty at first, but after being pressed, said, \"It certainly appears to be, yes.\"\n\nDavidson spoke in hypothetical terms on the tape, which Bove suggested was deliberately designed to enable Davidson to sit in a chair like the one he is in right now and say, \"I'm not sure if I was talking about Stormy Daniels.\"\n\nDavidson confirmed that, on the tape, he suggested that if things don't turn out the way a person thought they would, and they realize they have a lot more leverage, they try to settle it twice.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson confirms he continued working with Michael Cohen after the Stormy Daniels deal\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove's cross-examination of Keith Davidson has resumed. Davidson confirmed he continued working with Michael Cohen after the Stormy Daniels settlement, and that Cohen sent him \"a non-paying client.\" Asked by Bove to confirm the relationship with Cohen wasn't \"so horrific\" that Davidson would never work with him again, Davidson said: \"No, our relationship changed over time.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge won't give advance rulings on Trump posts of 'legal commentator' articles\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said he won't give advance rulings on whether Trump would violate the gag order by posting articles containing claims about his criminal case by legal commentators. However, he advised Trump defense lawyer Susan Necheles that, when in doubt, the best advice to give her client is to \"steer clear.\"\n\nNecheles raised the issue just after the lunch break, before jurors were in the courtroom. These are all articles President Trump would like to post \"on his Truth,\" she said, presumably referring to his Truth Social platform. However, he has \"some concerns\" because the articles discuss witnesses and prosecutors. Necheles mentioned Jonathan Turley, a Fox News Media contributor, as one of the commentators.\n\n\"There is no ambiguity\" in the order, Merchan said. He noted a New York appeals court has found there's nothing wrong with the order. Necheles said the appeals court was ruling in the abstract. \"I'm not going to argue with you,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels and what is her real name?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels says she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nWho is Emil Bove?\n\nEmil Bove is one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers, along with Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. Politico reported he joined the cohort in September 2023.\n\nBove is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n“Emil is an expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation and his trial skills are among the best in the business,” Blanche said in a statement provided to Politico.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump trial transcripts available online\n\nTrial transcripts and copies of evidence shown to the jury are published online.\n\nTranscripts of proceedings aren't always available, but New York court officials decided to make them available because of \"unparalleled public interest.\"\n\nMany of the transcripts are now available on the New York State Unified Court System's media website. Evidence shown to the jury, including texts, emails, photos and videos, also are available.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nCourt announces lunch break\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced a break for lunch. Trump exited the courtroom at 12:59 p.m. EDT, flanked by his legal team and other assistants. Reporters were allowed to exit while the prosecution remained huddled toward the front of the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson asked about Hulk Hogan-related extortion investigation\n\nBove again asked Davidson about a potential extortion issue related to past work by Davidson that was tied to Hulk Hogan.\n\nLaw enforcement investigated a million-dollar blackmail plot that targeted pro wrestler Hulk Hogan in relation to sex tapes, but didn't file charges, ⁠according to a local Tampa news organization, 10Investigates.\n\nBove asked Davidson to confirm the Tampa Police Department referenced concerns about extortion in relation to an investigation. Davidson said there was an investigation.\n\nBove noted Davidson wasn't ultimately charged, but asked if that experience gave him familiarity with extortion law. \"Perhaps, I don't know,\" Davidson said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarsh cross-examination focusing on past Davidson deals for clients\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove is asking Davidson aggressive questions about his past representation of clients. Bove asked, for example, if Charlie Sheen paid one of Davidson's clients $2 million. Davidson replied: \"I don't recall.\"\n\nBove asked if it was fair to say Davidson's memory seems sort of \"fuzzy\" around some of these issues. Davidson replied that he's had too many clients to remember all the deals, and doesn't remember a settlement from 13 years ago.\n\nBove also got Davidson to confirm he researched extortion laws years ago to make sure he doesn't cross the line, after dealing with an issue involving Hulk Hogan.\n\nWhen Bove challenged Davidson's testimony at one point, Davidson said: \"You're getting truthful answers, sir,\" with emphasis on the last word. \"I'm not going to discuss confidential matters,\" Davidson added.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I thought he was gonna kill himself': Davidson describes call, Cohen expressing possibility of becoming U.S. attorney general\n\nDavidson said Michael Cohen sounded so bad during a Dec. 9, 2016 call that he worried Cohen was a danger to himself. \"I thought he was gonna kill himself,\" Davidson said.\n\nCohen's concern on the call was that he wasn't going to get a position in Trump's presidential administration. Davidson said Cohen had previously raised the possibility of being Trump's chief of staff, or becoming the United States attorney general.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson denies sharing client confidences with Dylan Howard\n\nDuring earlier testimony in the trial, there was a suggestion that Keith Davidson was a major source for former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard. Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked Davidson if he was surprised to have been a major source for Howard, even though Davidson used to speak frequently with Howard. Davidson said he was surprised.\n\nBove asked Davidson to confirm he didn't share information with Howard that was protected by attorney-client privilege. That's correct, Davidson said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove begins cross-examining Keith Davidson\n\nAfter a short break in proceedings, Trump defense lawyer Emil Bove has started questioning Keith Davidson. Davidson negotiated hush money deals for both porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal tied to allegations of sexual affairs with Trump.\n\n\"You've never met President Trump, correct?\" Bove began by asking. Davidson confirmed that's true.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt on a short break\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced a short break after the prosecution finished questioning Davidson. Trump's defense team will likely start cross-examining Davidson after the break.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels goes on Jimmy Kimmel Jan. 31, 2018 show\n\nSteinglass and Davidson discussed an interview Stormy Daniels gave for a Jan. 31, 2018 episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". According to a New York Times transcript of the interview:\n\nKimmell asked: \"Do you have a nondisclosure agreement?\"\n\nDaniels responded: \"Do I?\"\n\nKimmell asked: \"You can’t say whether you have a nondisclosure agreement. But if you didn’t have a nondisclosure agreement, you most certainly could say, ‘I don’t have a nondisclosure agreement.’ Yes?\"\n\nDaniels responded: \"You’re so smart, Jimmy.\"\n\nKimmell asked: \"Have you ever made love to someone whose name rhymes with Lonald Lump?\"\n\nDaniels responded: \"I’ll call you whatever you want me to call you, baby.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson claims Daniels Jan. 30, 2018 denial also 'technically true'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Davidson about a Jan. 30, 2018 denial Stormy Daniels signed, and Davidson again defended its veracity: \"I think it's technically true.\"\n\nIn the statement, Daniels denied \"an alleged sexual relationship\" with Trump. Davidson testified he didn't believe anyone alleged there was a \"relationship\" between Daniels and Trump.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJan. 12, 2018 Wall Street Journal article described hush money deal\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2018, The Wall Street Journal published an article titled, \"Trump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star’s Silence.\" The story described the hush money deal just before the 2016 election, requiring Daniels to keep quiet about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter between Daniels and Trump. The story cited sources familiar with the matter.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson claims Stormy Daniels' denial of affair 'technically' true\n\nAsked by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass how he would characterize the truthfulness of Stormy Daniels' statement to The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 10, 2018, Davidson said, \"Well, I think that this is a tactic that is often times used,\" and an extremely strict reading of the denial \"would technically be true.\" Davidson added that you have to go through the denial \"word-by-word.\"\n\nPressed further by Steinglass, Davidson said you'd have to hone in on the definitions of \"romantic,\" \"sexual,\" and \"affair.\" Daniels denied having had a \"sexual and/or romantic affair\" in the statement Davidson said he believes he prepared. No one ever alleged that an encounter between Daniels and Trump was \"romantic,\" Davidson testified.\n\nAsked if he understood the letter to be misleading, Davidson said he didn't understand Steinglass' question.\n\nAsked about the truthfulness of Daniels' denial to getting hush money from Trump, Davidson said he would never use the words, \"hush money.\" He would call it \"consideration\" – a technical legal term that refers to what's given in exchange for something else in a contract.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson 'believes' he prepared Stormy Daniels Jan. 10, 2018 denial of affair\n\nAsked if he prepared a denial Stormy Daniels sent to The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 10, 2018 of any romantic or sexual affair with Donald Trump, Davidson replied: \"I believe so.\"\n\nThe statement was lengthy, including Daniels addressing allegations by news outlets that she had a \"sexual and/or romantic affair\" with Trump many years ago. Daniels said: \"I am stating with complete clarity that this is completely false.\"\n\nDaniels also said: \"Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson denied Trump-Daniels affair in Jan. 10, 2018 comment to Wall Street Journal\n\nDavidson testified he was asked for comment by The Wall Street Journal more than a year after the Daniels-Trump hush money deal on the relationship between Daniels and Trump. Davidson responded to the publication on Jan. 10, 2018:\n\n\"Comment: Nothing about the present day regurgitation of these rumors causes us to rethink our prior denial issued in 2011.\"\n\nThe 2011 denial was made to a blog called, \"TheDirty.com,\" which published a post about Daniels and Trump that year, Davidson testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'What have we done?' Davidson texted after Trump won election\n\n\"What have we done?\" Stormy Daniels' attorney Keith Davidson texted National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard on the night of the 2016 presidential election, according to text messages displayed in the courtroom. \"Oh my god,\" Howard responded.\n\nDavidson testified his message was humor after the polls showed Trump was leading in the election results. Pressed further on what he meant by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass, Davidson said his message reflected his belief that his and Howard's \"activities may have in some way\" helped Trump's presidential campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson made $10,000 personally from $130,000 deal\n\nDavidson testified he made $10,000 from Stormy Daniels' hush money deal. He said he dispersed everything except his attorney fee, and did so how Daniels directed. He didn't make clear whether he sent the remaining money directly to Daniels or to someone who did work for her. He said the question asked for him to improperly violate attorney-client privilege.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump referred to as 'David Dennison' in hush money deal\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass displayed a \"side letter agreement\" dated Oct. 28, 2016 that Davidson confirmed contained the real parties to the hush money settlement. The side letter agreement showed Donald Trump was referred to as \"David Dennison\" in the hush money deal. Daniels was referred to as \"Peggy Peterson.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDavidson confirms receiving money in Stormy Daniels hush money deal\n\nDavidson said he did finally receive the $130,000 promised by Michael Cohen as part of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal. Davidson testified on Tuesday that he had begun to doubt they would get the cash, after Cohen missed the deadline.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution witness Keith Davidson resumes testimony\n\nProsecution witness Keith Davidson, who was a lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in their hush money deals tied to Trump, has begun testifying. Davidson started testifying on Tuesday, before an off day in the trial on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass is asking Davidson about emails with Michael Cohen about getting paid as part of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow is Trump Media stock performing?\n\nAt open on May 2, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. share pricerose to $46.82, up 3.74% from the previous close.\n\nJudge sounds skeptical of defense on Trump jury comments\n\nBefore announcing a short break, Judge Merchan discussed with Trump lawyer Todd Blanche whether Trump has violated the gag order's prohibition on Trump making public comments about jurors. Prosecutors say Trump violated the gag order by saying in an interview: \"That jury was picked so fast — 95% democrats. ... It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you.\"\n\nBlanche argued it wasn't a violation because there are constitutional limits on the gag order to protect Trump's speech rights in relation to his presidential campaign. Blanche said his team believes this is a \"political persecution\" and a \"political trial,\" and that part of their belief is tied to the jurisdiction of the trial.\n\nMerchan didn't seem to have much respect for that argument. Merchan asked again: Did he violate the gag order?\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump responding to attacks on 'his character,' 'viability as a candidate':\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche showed Judge Juan Merchan several examples of former Trump lawyer and potential witness Michael Cohen going after Trump. One of the examples was a post Cohen made on X (formerly Twitter): \"Keep whining, crying and violating the gag order you petulant defendant!\"\n\nTrump has been responding to repeated attacks against Trump, including against \"his character\" and \"his viability as a candidate,\" Blanche said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge says Trump's comments on Cohen, Pecker could impact other witnesses\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche complained about alleged violations being raised by prosecutors even when Trump said something \"completely neutral\" about a witness. Blanche referenced Trump's statements on former tabloid executive David Pecker. Trump said Pecker had been \"very nice\" while Pecker's testimony was ongoing.\n\n\"It's not just about Mr. Pecker,\" Merchan responded. Merchan said it's also about what all of the other witnesses who may come here see. If they see what Trump says about Pecker or even Mr. Cohen, it affects those witnesses as well, Merchan said.\n\nMerchan added that he understood Blanche's concerns about Cohen, who has targeted Trump in national media appearances. But it's also about what other witnesses observe.\n\n\"That does go to the integrity of the proceedings,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump's statements are 'corrosive,' prosecutor argues\n\nConroy described Trump's statements as \"corrosive to this proceeding and to the fair administration of justice.\"\n\nThe statements at issue went after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. There were also positive statements about the prosecution's first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, while Pecker's testimony was ongoing. Trump said: \"He's been very nice. I mean, he's been — David's been very nice. A nice guy.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump 'thinks the rules should be different for him': Prosecutor\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy is giving a presentation on the four alleged violations of the gag order by Trump since the prosecution submitted 10 alleged violations in the case – nine of which the judge determined were substantiated.\n\n\"The defendant thinks the rules should be different for him,\" Conroy said about Trump's conduct with the four new allegations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Merchan arrives for gag order hearing\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 9:29 a.m. EST for this morning's hearing over whether Trump has violated a gag order an additional four times. The judge already held Trump in criminal contempt earlier this week after finding Trump violated the gag order nine times. Trump was fined $9,000 – the maximum $1,000 fine per violation – and warned future violations could mean jail time.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump gives mini-campaign speech before latest court session\n\nTrump began his latest day in court with a brief campaign speech, attacking Democrats for inflation and campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war, as well the hush money trial itself.\n\n\"They have no case,\" Trump told reporters before entering the courtroom.\n\nThe trial resumed after a full day of campaigning by Trump, who held rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\"It was quite a day yesterday,\" Trump said.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nProsecution enters courtroom\n\nThe prosecution team entered the courtroom at 9:21 a.m. EST, just after a group of photographers took photos of Trump at his defense table for about a minute. We are still waiting for the judge.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump arrives for Day 10 of trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom at 9:18 a.m. EST, with his line of lawyers following behind him. Lawyer Susan Necheles came in with a big grin.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Keith Davidson?\n\nKeith Davidson represented Daniels and McDougal in their deals to stay quiet about alleged affairs with Trump. He began testifying Tuesday, before an off day in the trial on Wednesday, about the hush money deals he negotiated for the two women ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDavidson was asked about text messages he sent during the negotiations that made clear he believed the hush money was aimed at boosting Trump's campaign. \"Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking Isle of Mann,\" he texted a tabloid editor while negotiating McDougal's deal. Davidson said on the stand it was a joke, but also that he believed the deal would help Trump's candidacy.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat can't Trump say under the gag order?\n\nThe gag order prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on witness participation in the case, or on jurors. He is also barred from making public comments about court and prosecution staff, their family members, or the family members of the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with work in the case.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy is Trump under a gag order?\n\nIn imposing a gag order on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Merchan noted a history of Trump making \"inflammatory\" statements that created fear in people tied to his legal cases and heightened security needs.\n\nThe judge pointed to 16 exhibits submitted by Bragg's office, including election worker Ruby Freeman describing death threats and harassment she faced after Trump accused her and her daughter – also an election worker – of tampering with the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n\nTrump ally Rudy Giuliani is appealing a $148 million jury verdict against him for intentionally inflicting emotional distress on the mother-daughter pair and defaming them through his own attacks on their election work.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up unlawful interference in the 2016 election through a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors say Trump falsified the purpose of checks to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to conceal that he was reimbursing Cohen for paying the hush money and thereby violating federal campaign finance laws. He is facing 34 felony counts.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCould Trump go to prison?\n\nThe 34 felony counts could theoretically send Trump to prison for decades, but several legal experts told USA TODAY a realistic sentence – if Trump were convicted on all counts – ranges from just probation to up to four years in prison.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/02"}]}

Here's some reasons why lettuce is so vulnerable and why tracking down the source of a bacterial outbreak can be difficult.\n\nAmerica hearts lettuce, especially women\n\nThanks to the national wellness trend embraced by healthy Millennials and aging Baby Boomers, the consumption of fresh vegetables, as opposed to frozen or shelf-stable varieties, is on the rise. Adding to that is the growing popularity of salad-centric restaurants, like Tender Greens and Sweetgreen, and the increasing inclusion of salads on the menus of fast-food chains.\n\nAccording to global market research firm Mintel's most recent data, 70% of vegetables sold in the U.S. in 2016 were fresh produce, up 13% from 2011, but growing at a 39% clip since then is fresh-cut salad, now 11% of what's in stores. Fresh veggies are forecast to grow 9% by 2021 and fresh-cut salads, 33%.\n\n\"Household vegetable purchase is universal and highly driven by fresh product purchases, with 97% of consumers purchasing fresh options in the past month,\" Mintel said.\n\nThe group most affected by the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak is women. According to the CDC, 65% of the people sickened as a result of this episode are female. Chalk that up to women being bigger salad eaters than men.\n\nBlame it on Mother Nature\n\nFields where produce is grown are subject to the whims of Mother Nature and her animals. Fruits and veggies grow in dirt and can be fertilized with manure. Bugs and birds fly around. Animals may run wild through even fenced fields — or defecate in rivers and lakes used to irrigate nearby farms. Growing out in the open means lots of opportunities for bacteria to enter the picture.\n\n\"Stuff is grown in nature outside. It can't be bacteria-free, virus-free, parasite-free,\" University of Florida food-safety expert Keith Schneider said. \"We do our best. The farmers jump through a lot of expensive hoops to make the food as clean as possible, but nature can intervene.\"\n\nLettuce is naturally unprotected\n\nUnlike some of its fruit and vegetable brethren, lettuce has nothing to keep it safe. The lack of rinds and peels — which you'd find on, say, a watermelon and a cucumber — gives bacteria countless entry points. A head of lettuce has tons of nooks and crannies for the nasty stuff to hide, making leafy greens far more vulnerable than other thinly-skinned, yet solid and easily washed produce, like tomatoes.\n\n\"The population is choosing to eat foods inherently more risky,\" said Matthew Stasiewicz, an assistant professor of applied food safety at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"Realistically, there’s not an activity in life that carries zero risk.\"\n\nDistance can make the problem grow faster\n\nThe days of getting produce year-round only from nearby farms are long gone. As the national food supply becomes more sophisticated, we're able to grow food at a central location and then pack it, preserve it and ship it around the U.S.\n\nDespite the ease social media and 24-hour news cycles bring to spreading warnings about outbreaks, following the food from point A to point E remains complicated.\n\nConvenience can lead to illness\n\nThe extra phase of processing the romaine lettuce — whether chopping it or simply packaging it — provides more chances for bacteria to sneak in.\n\n\"If all lettuce from the field is clean, you bring it to the packing house, and equipment is contaminated,\" Schneider said. \"All things that go over the belt, we can contaminate.\"\n\nA raw deal\n\nFoods you eat raw, like lettuce, miss out on a cooking phase that can kill bacteria. What the industry has dubbed \"the kill step\" withholds a key opportunity to get rid of food poisoning-causing particles. For example, applesauce, which is subjected to heat as part of the preparation, is far less likely to pose a problem than a raw Red Delicious apple. That's why health officials preach the importance of thoroughly cooking meat and poultry and to avoid unpasteurized dairy products. For produce, washing is key.\n\nIt can take a while before illness gets reported\n\nPeople sickened by romaine lettuce may not have reported it yet. The average lag is two to three weeks.\n\n\"One of the major challenges of identifying sources of foodborne disease is people eat a lot of food,\" Stasiewicz said. \"There’s also a major problem remembering what they eat. When eating a complex food, like a sandwich or burrito, you might not even know what you're eating.\"\n\nThe evidence is often tossed\n\nFresh produce has a short shelf life, especially quickly-spoiling bagged salads, so by the time the inspector made it to your house, the culprit would be long since, ahem, tossed.\n\nWhile you know what your favorite breakfast cereal is, chances are you don't recall the name of the company that makes your bagged lettuce. Forget about remembering the brand of lettuce heads or hearts you buy. That complicates tracking.\n\n\"Without a bag, a lot number to a farm, you don't know where it was packed and what farm it came from,\" Schneider said.\n\nAnd even if you miraculously still had the tainted lettuce, complete with the packer's or farm's name printed on it, the crop in the field by the time inspectors arrived would already be harvested.\n\nSolving the problem isn’t simply a matter of “lettuce CSI,\" according to Schneider. \"When you want to find the pathogen smoking gun, it’s gone.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2019/12/04/e-coli-outbreak-102-ill-salinas-california-romaine-lettuce/2611545001/", "title": "E. coli outbreak linked to California romaine lettuce expands with ...", "text": "Federal health officials are continuing to warn consumers to not eat romaine lettuce from Salinas, California.\n\nMore than 100 people in 23 states have been infected with a strain of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce harvested in the California growing region, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday.\n\nThe CDC said in an update that an additional 35 illnesses have been reported since Nov. 26 when there were 67 cases in 19 states.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration and the CDC are investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infections linked to the lettuce \"to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.\"\n\nSushi, salad recall:Products pulled from Trader Joe's, 7-Eleven, Walgreens due to listeria\n\nPork recall 2019:515,000 pounds of pork products recalled because they were not inspected\n\nThe outbreak has grown from when health officials put out a safety alert Nov. 22 warning consumers to not eat romaine lettuce from the California region from stores across the nation, and for restaurants to not serve the lettuce.\n\nIn an update Wednesday, the FDA said it \"requested that industry voluntarily withdraw romaine grown in Salinas from the market and is requesting that industry withhold distribution of Salinas romaine for the remainder of the growing season in Salinas.

But first, actors will reward themselves with even more trophies at the 30th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nTruth be told, this weekend's show is likely to come loaded with extra sentiment for its card-carrying union members, many of whom hit the picket lines during last year's industry-threatening 118-day standoff with producers. The strike ended with concessions made in compensation, benefits and AI image protections.\n\nThe belle of the SAG ball is EGOT winner (and recent mammoth memoir author) Barbra Streisand, who will receive SAG's lifetime achievement award for her work in front of and behind the camera.\n\nLike the Golden Globes, SAG Awards are doled out to both movie and TV actors − in this case by their peers. Of course, the real reason to tune in is to help you handicap your Oscar picks: SAG wins are often solid predictors of who will take home Academy Award accolades, given the overlap in the two groups' voters.\n\nHere's all you need to know about this year's SAG Awards:\n\nWhere can I watch the 2024 SAG Awards?\n\nAfter airing for a quarter-century on TBS and TNT, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which take place Saturday, have again found a home at Netflix, where they'll stream at 8 p.m. EST/5 PST.\n\nThe two-hour live show will emanate from the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall, a historic Los Angeles venue that has also been home to the Oscars in years past. That's a notable step up from last year's show, which took place at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel.\n\nWhere can I watch the SAG Awards red carpet pre-show?\n\n\"Queer Eye\" star Tan France and pioneering fashion editor Elaine Welteroth will host the SAG pre-show with an emphasis on critiquing the various fashion statements (or faux pas) that make their way down the red carpet. The pre-show will stream live on Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok at 7 p.m. EST/4 PST.\n\nFrance and Welteroth will team up to interview nominees, highlighting the best fashion looks of the night and giving viewers a look at the star-studded arrivals. Also, in a rarity, look for stunt performers to get their moment in the sun: During the pre-show, winners for best stunt ensemble performances in movies and TV will be revealed.\n\nAdditionally, People and Entertainment Weekly will stream a red carpet special, hosted by EW editor-in-chief Patrick Gomez, People editor at large Janine Rubenstein and EW editorial director Gerrad Hall. This live pre-show will stream at people.com and EW.com, as well as People's and EW’s YouTube, Facebook, X and TikTok pages, beginning at 6 p.m. EST/3 PST.\n\nFinally, \"E!

Brown (\"American Fiction\"), Michael Cera (\"Barbie\"), Jessica Chastain(\"Mothers’ Instinct\"), Colman Domingo (\"Rustin,\" \"The Color Purple\"), Robert Downey Jr. (\"Oppenheimer\") and Phil Dunster (\"Ted Lasso\").\n\nOther stars slated to present are Billie Eilish(\"Swarm\"), America Ferrera (\"Barbie\"), Brendan Fraser (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"), Taraji P.

Her industry friends are awarding her SAG's lifetime achievement award for both her career and humanitarian laurels. \"She is a colossal icon with a relentless work ethic, evolving with each stage of her remarkable journey,\" said Fran Drescher.\n\nStreisand has worked in nearly every conceivable medium, from stage to screen (large and small), in the studio and behind the camera. Among her honors are two Academy Awards, eight Grammys (plus the Grammy Legend and lifetime achievement awards), five Emmy Awards and a Tony Award.\n\nWant to know more about her? Last year's big book release, \"My Name Is Barbra,\" is 970 pages of Streisand telling you her life story. Consider the audiobook; it's read by Streisand herself.\n\nWho are the 2024 SAG Award nominees?\n\nThis year's SAG nominees are largely familiar names and faces, if you've paid attention to recent award shows such as the Golden Globes, where \"Oppenheimer\" outpaced \"Barbie.\"\n\nSAG nominees for outstanding ensemble cast include Oscar best picture nominees \"American Fiction,\" \"Barbie,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" plus \"The Color Purple.\" Best male performance will see if Cillian Murphy (\"Oppenheimer\") or Paul Giamatti (\"The Holdovers\") can steal the statue, with Bradley Cooper (\"Maestro\"), Colman Domingo (\"Rustin\") and Jeffrey Wright (\"American Fiction\") rounding out the pack.\n\nAmong the women, Oscar nominee Annette Bening (\"Nyad\") is up against Barbie herself, Margot Robbie, as well as Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\"), Carey Mulligan (\"Maestro\") and Golden Globe winner Lily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Fower Moon\").\n\nIn best supporting actor, look for Globe winner Robert Downey Jr. (\"Oppenheimer\") to duke it out with Robert De Niro (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"), Sterling K. Brown (\"American Fiction\"), Willem Dafoe (\"Poor Things\") and Ryan Gosling (\"Barbie\"). Among the women, Globe winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph (\"The Holdovers\") is the front-runner in a field that includes Emily Blunt (\"Oppenheimer\"), Danielle Brooks (\"The Color Purple\"), Penélope Cruz (“Ferrari”) and Jodie Foster (\"Nyad\").\n\nWho has won the most SAG Awards?\n\nIf you're curious which actors have been rewarded the most by their peers, we've got you covered. According to the Screen Actors Guild, Julia Louis-Dreyfus leads that illustrious list. She has won nine best actor awards, including five individual awards and four ensemble awards for her work on both \"Veep\" and \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nWho's been nominated the most?

What to know about the host, 2024 ...", "text": "The biggest night in television is nearly upon us as the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards swiftly approach. The star-studded awards show, initially scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Sept. 18, was postponed amid the dual writers and actors strikes.\n\nThis marks the most significant delay of the Emmys since 2001, when the show was put on hold for seven weeks following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the related U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. (The Emmys carried on during the 2020 pandemic with a virtual show.)\n\nHere's what to know about the Emmys, which honor excellence in the TV industry, and the rest of the 2024 awards season.\n\nWhen are the Emmys?\n\nThe 75th Primetime Emmy Awards will be held Jan. 15 at 8 p.m. EST/5 PST.\n\nThe show will broadcast live from the Peacock Theater in downtown LA.\n\nWho's hosting the Emmys?\n\nActor and comedian Anthony Anderson will host the 75th Emmy Awards.\n\n\"With our industry's recent challenges behind us, we can get back to what we love − dressing up and honoring ourselves. And there's no better celebratory moment to bring the creative community together than the milestone 75th Emmy Awards,\" Anderson said in a statement.\n\nWhere to watch the Emmys?\n\nThe Emmy Awards will air on Fox. The show will be available to stream a day later on Hulu (Jan. 16).\n\nWhy are the Emmys so late this year?\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards are generally held every September.\n\nThe 75th Emmy Awards were scheduled to take place on Sept. 18, while the Creative Arts ceremonies were planned for Sept. 9 and 10.\n\nIn July 2023, USA TODAY confirmed that the awards show would be postponed to January because the writers and actors strikes largely put Hollywood on pause.\n\nIn August, it was officially announced the 2023 Emmy Awards would be pushed to early January. The Primetime Emmys would air on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while the Creative Arts Emmy Awards would be held Jan. 6 and 7 (airing Jan. 13 at 8 p.m. EST on FXX).\n\nThese new dates align with Emmy history as the first awards ceremony took place on Jan. 25, 1949.

Here it comes. And my eyes see 'Oppenheimer.' Yes. Yes.\"\n\nThe audience appeared confused about whether Pacino had, in fact, just announced the winner, and it took a moment for the orchestra to kick in and for the \"Oppenheimer\" nominees to begin making their way to the stage.\n\nOscars 2024 winners:See the full list of celebrities who took home Academy Award gold\n\nAl Pacino claims delivery of the Oscars best picture winner was 'a choice by the producers'\n\nThe day after the Oscars, Pacino issued a statement explaining why the \"Oppenheimer\" win was delivered so abruptly, with no mention of the other best picture nominees.\n\n\"I just want to be clear it was not my intention to omit them, rather a choice by the producers not to have them said again since they were highlighted individually throughout the ceremony. I was honored to be a part of the evening and chose to follow the way they wished for this award to be presented,\" Pacino said, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"I realize being nominated is a huge milestone in one's life and to not be fully recognized is offensive and hurtful. I say this as someone who profoundly relates with filmmakers, actors and producers so I deeply empathize with those who have been slighted by this oversight and it’s why I felt it necessary to make this statement,\" he added.\n\n'Most anti-climactic Oscar win ever': Social media reacts to Al Pacino\n\nPacino's confusing delivery immediately sparked a wave of memes on social media, as viewers joked that he was trying to wrap the show up as quickly as possible. \"Al Pacino had a 7:30pm reservation at Musso & Frank, he needed to move things along,\" critic Richard Roeper posted on X, referencing the actor's role in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nOne X user described this as the \"most anti-climactic oscar win ever,\" while another post summed up Pacino's attitude as, \"Sure whatever it's Oppenheimer ok bye bye.\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" was widely expected to win the best picture Oscar, adding to the anticlimactic nature of the end of the ceremony. Christopher Nolan also won best director for the historical epic, while stars Robert Downey Jr. and Cillian Murphy won best supporting actor and best actor, respectively.\n\nThanks to Pacino, this was the latest Academy Awards broadcast to end on a confusing, anticlimactic note after best actor was presented last at the end of the 2021 Oscars instead of best picture, only for the surprise winner, Anthony Hopkins, to not even be present to accept the award.\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Al Pacino, wonders if he's ever 'watched an awards show before'\n\nAppearing Monday on \"Live with Kelly and Mark,\" Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel playfully mocked Pacino over his abrupt best picture announcement.\n\n\"I guess he's never watched an awards show before?\" Kimmel said. \"Seems like everyone in America knows the rhythm of how it's supposed to go, down to 'and the Oscar goes to.' But not Al. God bless him.\"\n\nHost Kelly Ripa also joked that Pacino had cut \"like 12 minutes\" out of the end of the show with his quick delivery. \"We were like, don't open that envelope,\" she said. \"Don't you open that envelope, Al!\"\n\nMichelle Pfeiffermisses reported 'Scarface' reunion with Al Pacino at Oscars", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/02/04/2024-grammys-live-updates/72403958007/", "title": "Grammys 2024: Best speeches, top winners, celebrity moments", "text": "That's a wrap on the 66th annual Grammy Awards! And, let me tell you, they had everything.\n\nThere was drama. (See: Jay-Z clapping back at the Recording Academy for snubbing his wife Beyoncé.) There was shock. (Thank you for the new album announcement, Taylor Swift!) And there were tears. (JoniMitchell, we don't deserve you.)\n\nKiller Mike was led out of the Crypto.com Arena in handcuffs, while Swift also made history as the first person to win album of the year four times. And Lainey Wilson, Miley Cyrus and Karol G claimed their first Grammys on music's biggest night.\n\nHere are the biggest updates, along with our unfiltered reactions of the awards show on CBS.\n\nTaylor Swift is 'mind-blown' after becoming first person ever to win album of the year four times\n\nYou know, I’m starting to think karma may really be her boyfriend. Nothing seems to get in the way of Taylor Swift's total music (and world) domination. The artist became the first person to win album of the year four times. “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song,” she said, noting she was feeling \"mind blown.\" “For me, the award is the work.” She accepted the honor from Céline Dion, who made a surprise appearance as presenter following her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis. “I really mean it from my heart: Those that have been blessed enough to be here… must never take for granted the tremendous love and joy that music brings to our lives and to people all around the world,” Dion said.\n\nMore:Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth album of the year win for 'Midnights'\n\nMiley Cyrus 'might have forgotten underwear,' almost missed first Grammys win due to rain traffic\n\nMiley Cyrus clearly doesn’t take herself, or awards shows, too seriously, and it’s honestly so refreshing. After her fun, lively and seemingly Tina-Turner-inspired performance of “Flowers,” she returned to claim the trophy for record of the year for the same song. In her speech, she reminded everyone that, even though not everyone can win a Grammy, everyone is “spectacular” and trophies don’t define success. (Are you listening, Jay-Z?) After some quick thank you’s, she quipped: “I don’t think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten underwear. Bye!”\n\nMore:Miley Cyrus just won the first Grammy of her career\n\nEarlier, she spoke on behalf of all Los Angeles residents when she confessed she almost missed her first ever Grammys win due to heavy rain traffic. “This is just too iconic,” she said onstage beside Mariah Carey, accepting the award for best pop solo performance for “Flowers.\" “I just got stuck in the rain in traffic and thought I was going to miss this moment.” Anybody who has ever braved an LA freeway during a light drizzle knows exactly what she’s talking about.\n\nJay-Z uses 'thank you' speech to say his wife Beyoncé deserves album of the year\n\nWhile accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z used his acceptance speech to call out the Recording Academy's snubs against his wife, Beyoncé. \"We love y'all. We want y'all to get it right,\" he said. \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\" Though the Bey-Hive will surely eat this moment up, it's hard to feel much sympathy for a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist complaining at an awards show that his wife − also a mega-wealthy, mega-awarded artist − is actually entitled to more trophies.\n\nMore:Jay-Z calls out Grammys over Beyoncé snubs: 'We want y'all to get it right'\n\nJoni Mitchell silences and stuns crowd with 'Both Sides Now'\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the Grammys – and, dare I say, music itself – is all about. The most powerful moment of the broadcast came in the most simple, elegant performance of the night – something that’s become an unfortunate rarity at a show that tends to favor big dance numbers and pyrotechnics. Sitting in a regal chair and singing her soaring, timeless song “Both Sides, Now,” Joni Mitchell transported the Crypto.com Arena, and all of us watching at home, to a different place entirely. She sang with humility, grace and, most of all, a deep, deep love for music. It was moving. It was honest. It was unifying. It was everything a Grammys performance should be. Not to mention it was her first time performing at the ceremony ever too!\n\nDuring the premiere ceremony, Mitchell, 80, who suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015 that left her temporarily unable to walk or talk won for best folk album for \"Joni Mitchell at Newport (Live).\" Walking out onto the stage with a cane, Mitchell beamed at the crowd before giving a brief, humble thank you.\n\nMore:Joni Mitchell, 80, offers a stunning 'Both Sides, Now' for first Grammys performance\n\nVictoria Monét wins best new artist\n\nVictoria Monét won best new artist, beating out fellow nominees Gracie Abrams, Fred again, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones and Noah Kahan. Born Victoria Monét McCants, the artist came into the ceremony with seven Grammy nominations — behind only SZA with nine — and in the pre-show awards, she won best R&B album and best engineered album for \"Jaguar II\" but lost traditional R&B performance to PJ Morton.\n\nOprah, Fantasia honor Tina Turner in raucous In Memoriam segment\n\nThe In Memoriam segment, usually a somber montage honoring artists who've died, turned into a rousing concert, closing out with a lively tribute to Tina Turner, intro'd by Oprah Winfrey and ending with high-energy performance of \"Proud Mary\" by Fantasia. The number got everyone on their feet, and the energy could be felt through the screen. Detractors will surely say the segment should have been more subdued, but no one can deny Fantasia put on a good show.\n\nAnnie Lennox calls for Israel, Palestine ceasefire in middle of In Memoriam segment\n\nAnother potentially controversial In Memoriam moment? Annie Lennox ending her tribute to Sinéad O'Connor with a reference to the war between Israel and Palestine. \"Artists for ceasefire! Peace in the world!\" she exclaimed after her song.\n\nTaylor Swift announces new album 'The Tortured Poets Department' coming in April\n\nLeave it to Taylor Swift to zig when we all thought she would zag. After seeming to tease the re-recording of her album “Reputation” with a website crash earlier today, she ended up revealing she’s dropping a new album entirely instead. “This is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number,” Swift said, after winning best pop vocal album for “Midnights. “I know the way the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19. It’s called 'The Tortured Poets Department.' I’m gonna go and post the cover right now backstage.\" Well, OK then!\n\nMore:Taylor Swift announces brand-new album at Grammys: 'Tortured Poets Department'\n\nLainey Wilson, from farmer's daughter to Grammy winner\n\nLainey Wilson joined Karol G and Miley Cyrus in the Grammy first-timers club. During her acceptance speech for best country album for \"Bell Bottom Country,\" Wilson, a fifth generation farmer's daughter from a town of 200, gave a winding extended metaphor about how making an album is a lot like farming, or something like that. “Sometimes when you find the right farming community, you can find the harvest of a lifetime,\" she said. I have never farmed before, but I trust her completely.\n\nKiller Mike wins Grammys but leaves in handcuffs\n\nKiller Mike's triumphant run at the Grammys took a turn after the rapper was handcuffed. Shortly after winning three awards during the pre-show ceremony, he was escorted out of the Crypto.com arena in handcuffs by a squad of police officers, video shared by The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Gardner on X shows. It's unclear if the rapper was arrested or will return for the live ceremony. USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Killer Mike, the Recording Academy and the Los Angeles Police Department. Killer Mike won Grammys for best rap song and best rap performance for his song \"Scientists and Engineers\" and best rap album for \"Michael.\"\n\nMore:Killer Mike escorted out of Grammys in handcuffs after winning 3 awards\n\nKarol G wins 'the first of so many' Grammys\n\nLet's go, Karol G! The Colombian singer and songwriter became a first-time Grammy winner, taking home the trophy for best música urbana album for her album \"Mañana Será Bonito.\" \"I promise you to give you my best always, and I hope this is the first of so many,\" she said onstage. It's been less than an hour, and we've already seen career firsts for two major artists. At this rate, who knows what will else will happen?\n\nTrevor Noah opening monologue: A Taylor Swift joke she actually laughs at\n\nAt the Golden Globes, you could practically hear a pin drop when host Jo Koy made a joke about the frequent Taylor Swift cutaways at NFL games. That joke didn't seem to land with the pop star then, who took a cold sip from her cup while staring daggers at the comedian. Lucky for Trevor Noah, Swift seemed to have found her sense of humor in time for the Grammys, laughing when he joked that every time he mentions Swift's name, the broadcast should cut to a former NFL player. The camera then focused on a befuddled Terry Crews. Noah stayed mostly complimentary throughout his opening monologue. Was he pandering a little to the A-listers? Sure, but it was no disaster, which, in the realm of award shows, should be counted as a win.\n\nTaylor Swift website crashes. Are we getting 'Reputation (Taylor's Version)' soon?\n\nApparently not. Swift's website crashed Sunday afternoon for about two hours, and Swifties believed the site was riddled with Easter eggs teasing the long-anticipated announcement of the re-release of her sixth album \"Reputation (Taylor's Version).\" Swift's website appeared to show an error message hours before the Grammys. The first line was \"Error 321 Backend fetch failed.\" (Error 321 is a communication error that would appear on a fax machine with a poor telephone line connection.) \"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now\" is a line from Swift's track \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" the lead single on \"Reputation.\" Turns out, however, Swift had other plans, announcing an entirely new album instead.\n\nJack Antonoff ties Babyface's record, gives shoutout to Taylor Swift\n\nWith his win for best producer of the year, non-classical, Jack Antonoff joined Babyface as the only person to win the category three times in a row. During his acceptance speech, which rounded out the premiere ceremony, Antonoff thanked his wife Margaret Qualley and others who have supported him in his career, including his collaborator Taylor Swift. \"We made a song called 'Out of the Woods' for '1989,' and, when I was waiting for that call that says, 'OK, now this goes to some big-name person,' she said, 'Let's mix this...,' \" he said. \"I love you to death, Taylor.\"\n\nMichelle Obama makes Grammys history\n\nThat’s double-Grammy-winner Michelle Obama to you! The former first lady took home the Grammy for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording for “The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times.” It’s the second time she’s won a Grammy (she won in 2020 for \"Becoming), making her the only former first lady with two wins.\n\nGrammys red carpet sees stars brave the rain\n\nIt’s the calm before the storm inside the massive white tent housing the Grammys red carpet, anyway. Outside, the downpour that meteorologists have promised all week has commenced. We are in the sweet spot on the carpet between artists attending the Grammys pre-show and the televised ceremony, and a few notable faces, including Josh Groban, boygenius and Victoria Monét, have made quick appearances. With two hours to go until the ceremony, things are certain to start heating up soon. –KiMi Robinson\n\nThe Beatles win best music video at the Grammys\n\nThe Beatles may have broken up about five decades ago, but they still can’t stop winning Grammys! The group won best music video at the premiere ceremony for their 1966 song “I’m Only Sleeping,” which got an official music video in November 2022. “I can’t believe I get to say this: I’d like to thank John, Paul, George and Ringo!” the video’s director Em Cooper exclaimed in her acceptance speech.\n\n'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' win back-to-back Grammy honors\n\nWhat was that? You thought the Barbenheimer double features had finally come to an end? Well, think again: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which dominated theaters last summer, won back-to-back at the Grammys premiere ceremony. “Barbie the Album” won best compilation soundtrack for visual media and “Oppenheimer” for best score soundtrack for visual media. Billie Eilish and Finneas also made an early appearance to accept their award for best song written for visual media for their “Barbie” song “What Was I Made For?” “Making this song saved me a little bit,” Eilish said of the soft ballad in their acceptance speech.\n\nPentatonix, Sheila E., Jordin Sparks and more kick off early Grammys ceremony with rousing opening number\n\nWell, that got started with a bang! If downtown Los Angeles was feeling sleepy amid this uncharacteristic rain, it better be awake now after the opening number of the premiere ceremony. J. Ivy, Pentatonix, Larkin Poe, Jordin Sparks and Sheila E. took the stage for a rousing set that seemed to jolt the theater awake, ending with a booming drum solo from Sheila E. while Sparks belted for her life. Let’s hope that energy lasts, because the Grammy ceremonies are going to unfold over for the course of the next nine hours.\n\nWho votes for the Grammys?\n\nThe Illuminati − just kidding (kind of). Voting members of the Recording Academy do. These members, according to the organization's website, \"are composed of a pool of vetted and venerable performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists, and other creators currently working in the recording industry.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/03/25/2024-cmt-awards-live-music-performances-austin-texas-moody-center/73029290007/", "title": "Who is performing at 2024 CMT Music Awards show live from Austin?", "text": "Austin is again home to the 2024 CMT Music Awards, meaning some of country music's biggest stars will be flocking to the city ahead of the April 7 awards show.\n\nThe show, hosted by Kelsea Ballerini, will air live from the Moody Center on CBS at 7 p.m. It will feature performances from a variety of decorated entertainers, including up-and-comer Jelly Roll and country music mainstay Keith Urban.

So Sunday night I settled in with the family to watch the 96th Oscars ceremony, ready to enjoy the finale of a not-so-newsy awards season.\n\nAnd guess what? Not only do I not have bad news, but the extraordinary moments out of the more than three hours were so good that I thought it's only fair to recognize what went spectacularly right with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences this year.\n\nOverlooked at the Oscars:There were many movies and performances that were tragically overlooked Sunday night and during the whole awards season\n\nHere are my favorite acceptance speeches, celebrations of unsung heroes and Oscar show performances. They chilled me, as I thought of where we are in history.

But probably I will be the first director on this stage who will say I wish I'd never made this film.\n\n\"I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities. I wish to give all the recognition (for) Russia not killing tens of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians. I wish for them to release all the hostages. ... But I cannot change the history, cannot change the past. But we all together ... can make sure that the history record is set straight, and that the truth will prevail, and that the people of Mariupol and those who have given their lives will never be forgotten.\n\n\"Because cinema forms memories, and memories form history.\"\n\n'The Zone of Interest'\n\nAccepting the best international film Oscar for \"The Zone of Interest,\" a Holocaust movie set just outside Auschwitz at a villa where real-life Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss (played by Christian Friedel) lived with his wife, Hedwig (Sandra Hüller), and their kids, director and co-writer Jonathan Glazer said: \"Our film shows where dehumanization leads, at its worst. ...\n\n\"Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people.

The news was first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Department of Justice will send its recommendation to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug to the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Justice Department is expected to transmit the recommendation today, the source said.\n\nMore:Trucker failed drug test after taking CBD supplement. Supreme Court to decide if he can sue\n\nThe plan wouldn't legalize marijuana at the federal level outright, but it would reclassify it from a Schedule I drug – believed highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use – to a Schedule III drug that can be lawfully prescribed as medication. Marijuana has been a Schedule I drug since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970.\n\n“It is significant for these federal agencies, and the DEA and FDA in particular, to acknowledge publicly for the first time what many patients and advocates have known for decades: that cannabis is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tens of millions of Americans,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, which advocates for cannabis to be removed altogether from the list of controlled substances.\n\nThis bureaucratic move is only a small step toward what advocates hope will be full legalization of the drug. However, the new proposed classification does not fully address the inconsistencies between federal restrictions and the laws in a growing number of states that have authorized medical and recreational use of pot.\n\nTwenty-four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and 14 other states authorize it for medical use, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Rescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address this conflict, as existing state legalization laws – both adult use and medical – will continue to be in conflict with federal regulations, thereby perpetuating the existing divide between state and federal marijuana policies,\" Armentano said in a statement.\n\nThe federal proposal to reschedule marijuana would have broad support among voters. A nationwide survey last fall commissioned by the Coalition for Cannabis Scheduling Reform found nearly 60% of likely voters supported rescheduling, with 65% of younger voters 18 to 25 favoring it, the highest of any demographic group polled. Overall, the number of Americans who think marijuana should be legal reached a record high at 70%, according to a Gallup poll in the fall.\n\nFor decades, marijuana has been listed under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy. The act categorizes drugs based on their potential for abuse, addiction and medical use. Schedule I drugs are outlawed under federal law level and deemed to be without accepted medical use.\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a review of how marijuana is classified; and last year HHS recommended it be rescheduled to Schedule III, alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids. The Justice Department did its own analysis and reached the same conclusion, the source said.\n\nThe proposal will undergo a public review period; the source did not say when the proposed rule would be open to public comment.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., has previously criticized federal efforts to change Marijuana's classification. Harris was a physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, according to his online biography.\n\n\"Removing restrictions on an addictive gateway drug like Marijuana is a dangerous mistake. Numerous studies, including a recent and reputable study published by JAMA, points to the negative impact recreational marijuana has on the body and brain,\" Harris said in a Tuesday social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nExperts previously told USA TODAY that marijuana’s placement on Schedule I was not based on credible scientific evidence of its perils, but once it was listed, researchers and advocates faced a heavy burden trying to prove it shouldn’t face such stiff restrictions.\n\nWhat exactly does rescheduling cannabis mean?\n\nPlacing marijuana in Schedule III puts it on par with drugs, such as ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine, that have “moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,” according to the DEA.\n\nSchedule III drugs can be legally prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies. Rescheduling could also help resolve a massive federal tax burden that has been placed on cannabis companies – which were effectively seen as drug traffickers for tax purposes.\n\nBut rescheduling marijuana doesn’t make it legal to use recreationally, and it doesn’t change much about current state cannabis programs, said Jay Wexler, who teaches a seminar about marijuana laws at Boston University. It would still a controlled substance even with the new announcement\n\nWexler and other policy experts and advocates say rescheduling is not a solution, but it could be a sign the federal government is catching up with public opinion and consensus in the medical field that there are therapeutic benefits to marijuana, along with some risks.\n\n\"Rescheduling is a step forward, but it is not nearly enough. And there's no reason to keep cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act,” Wexler previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat are the possible risks of marijuana?\n\nBecause of its classification, marijuana has been hard to study. But the move to reschedule marijuana is due in large part to its lower public health risk, federal scientists have said.\n\nIn a leaked HHS document, officials wrote to the DEA to support lowering its classification to Schedule III. Its risk for addiction was lower than other drugs and it had medical benefits, unlike Schedule I and II drugs, HHS researchers said.\n\nStill, scientists said, users develop moderate to low physical dependence on it, and there is some risk of psychological dependence. However, they noted, the withdrawal symptoms are “relatively mild” compared with alcohol. Marijuana is more comparable to tobacco, they said.\n\nThere are no known deaths from a marijuana overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA. But it does affect physical and mental health.\n\nMarijuana can cause permanent IQ loss for people who begin using it at a young age, the institute said. Additionally, long-term use has been associated with temporary paranoia and hallucinations, and it can exacerbate symptoms with disorders such as schizophrenia, NIDA said.\n\nMarijuana smoke has a similar health impact to tobacco smoke. NIDA found people who smoke marijuana frequently develop issues with breathing, akin to tobacco smokers.\n\nSmoking cannabis, the most common way to consume the drug, may have additional risks because of particulate matter a person inhales, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Researchers noted cannabis smoke isn’t all that different than tobacco smoke, the only difference being the added effect of the psychoactive drug THC in marijuana rather than nicotine in tobacco.\n\nRespiratory issues include daily cough, phlegm and a higher risk of lung infections, however, the institute said it’s unclear if marijuana causes a greater risk of lung cancer.\n\nSmoking marijuana also increases heart rate, which can increase the chance of heart attack, especially among older people and people with heart conditions. The Heart Association journal study linked increased cannabis use with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n“Despite common use, little is known about the risks of cannabis use and, in particular, the cardiovascular disease risks,” the study’s lead author, Abra Jeffers, a data analyst at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement. “The perceptions of the harmfulness of smoking cannabis are decreasing, and people have not considered cannabis use dangerous to their health. However, previous research suggested that cannabis could be associated with cardiovascular disease.” She noted that smoking cannabis, which is the predominant way it is used, could pose other risks because it involves inhaling particulate matter.\n\nIn the study published in late February, researchers examined Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data of over 400,000 adults from 2016 to 2020, looking at self-reported cannabis use with cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nPeople who used marijuana daily had a 25% higher chance of having a heart attack and a 42% higher chance of stroke than those who didn’t use it at all.\n\nProposal reflects potential for health benefits\n\nThe cannabis plant has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries if not millennia. It appears to help with treating pain, insomnia, anxiety, and glaucoma, among other health conditions. Still, evidence is mixed and more research into its health benefits is needed, researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said in August.\n\nWhile the FDA hasn’t approved the cannabis plant for any medical use, federal regulators have approved several drugs containing cannabinoids, or substances such as THC or CBD found in the cannabis plant, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThese include Epidiolex, a purified form of CBD ingested orally, that is FDA-approved to treat seizures associated with two severe forms of epilepsy. Marinol and Syndros both contain synthetic THC and are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Nabilone, another synthetic similar to THC, is approved as the brand name drug Cesamet for people with HIV/AIDS who experiencing weight loss and appetite loss.\n\nA 2017 federal report found cannabis or cannabinoids were more likely to reduce pain symptoms for patients with chronic pain. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabis is effective in treating symptoms of multiple sclerosis, particularly addressing the stiff or rigid muscles caused by the disease. One cannabinoid drug, nabiximol, a mouth spray that has both THC and CBD, has been approved in several countries but not in the U.S. Under the brand name Sativex, it has shown pain relief for people with cancer or multiple sclerosis.\n\nOther research has examined cannabis’ uses to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, but the NIH said the evidence is mixed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2024/05/01/dea-marijuana-schedule-3-reclassify-lower-risk-drug-joe-biden-weed-texas/73515473007/", "title": "Biden administration plans to reclassify weed as a lower-risk drug ...", "text": "The Biden administration could reclassify the federal government's position on marijuana, which would help decriminalize the drug.\n\nThe proposed plan would no longer consider cannabis a Schedule I drug – believed highly dangerous, addictive, and without medical use.\n\nHere’s where the Biden administration's plan currently stands.\n\nWhat is the Biden administration proposing?\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration’s proposal, which has to be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, would recognize the medical uses of cannabis, acknowledge it has less potential for abuse and reclassify cannabis as a Schedule III drug. It would not legalize cannabis for recreational use.\n\nWhat is a scheduled drug?\n\nAccording to the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, controlled (scheduled) drugs, substances, and certain chemicals are ones whose use and distribution are tightly controlled because of their abuse potential or risk. Controlled drugs are rated in the order of their abuse risk and placed in Schedules by the DEA.\n\nWhy is cannabis a Schedule 1 drug?\n\nRecreational cannabis use in the U.S. has been around since the 20th century as well as movements to regulate its use, according to the National Institute of Health. However, in 1914, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act was passed, which declared drug use a crime. There have been several laws that discouraged cannabis use and came with harsher penalties for doing so.\n\nAccording to the NIH, California became the first State to make it illegal to possess cannabis. In the 1930s, the then U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics warned of the increasing abuse of cannabis, and by 1937, 23 States had criminalized possession. By 1970, the Controlled Substances Act passed, and the Federal government categorized marijuana as a Schedule I substance.\n\nWhat are the current Schedule 1 drugs?\n\nFor decades, marijuana has been listed under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy. Schedule I drugs are outlawed under federal law level and deemed to be without accepted medical use.\n\nAccording to the DEA, the following are examples of Schedule I drugs:\n\nHeroin\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)\n\nCannabis\n\nMethamphetamine\n\nMethaqualone (Quaalude)\n\nPeyote\n\nSee full list of controlled substances here.\n\nWhat are schedule III drugs?\n\nAccording to the DEA, the following are examples of Schedule III drugs:\n\nKetamine\n\nAnabolic steroids\n\nTestosterone\n\nProducts containing less than 90mg of codeine per dosage unit\n\nSee full list of controlled substances here.\n\nWhat's the difference between decriminalizing and legalizing weed?\n\nThere is a difference. According to the ACLU, drug decriminalization is the act of removing criminal sanctions against certain activities, including possession of drugs for personal use.\n\nLegalization of marijuana would mean individuals 21 or older can possess certain amounts of cannabis freely under state or federal law, although it can still be regulated.\n\nHow many states have decriminalized cannabis?\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, several states have passed legislation to decriminalize cannabis laws. \"Although the law still classifies marijuana possession offenses as criminal, the offenses do not carry any threat of jail time,\" according to NORML.\n\nHere are states that have decriminalized cannabis.\n\nAlaska\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nConnecticut\n\nMaine\n\nMinnesota\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRhode Island\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDelaware\n\nCalifornia\n\nIllinois\n\nMaryland\n\nNevada\n\nOhio\n\nVermont\n\nColorado\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nMissouri\n\nOregon\n\nVirginia\n\nHawaii\n\nNebraska\n\nMississippi\n\nLouisiana\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIs weed legal in Texas?\n\nRecreational use is still not legal in Texas. But there is low-level use through the Compassionate-Use Act. In 2015, Texas passed the Compassionate-Use Act, which allowed the first legal use of low-THC cannabis products in the state for patients with intractable epilepsy. It was expanded in 2019 and 2021 to include other conditions.\n\nMarijuana laws in Texas are confusing.Here's a guide to know what is and isn't legal\n\nIn 2019, Gov. Greg Abbott signed House Bill 1325 into law. The law allows the production, manufacture, retail sale, and inspection of industrial hemp crops and products in Texas, granted that they stay at 0.3% or less delta-9 THC level. This also includes products for consumable hemp products that contain cannabidiol (CBD), as well as other edible parts of the hemp plant.\n\nTexas NORML has listed statutes that show the penalties for the amount of cannabis possession someone would have.\n\nTexas cities and counties that have decriminalized marijuana\n\nHere is a list of municipalities that have decriminalized local cannabis law.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/17/is-marijuana-legal-why-feds-are-taking-so-long-to-change/72537426007/", "title": "Is marijuana legal? Why feds are taking so long to change old rules.", "text": "Marijuana remains in an odd legal limbo in the United States, and there's one organization at the center of it: the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe DEA has for decades held that marijuana is among the most dangerous, highly addictive drugs and has no medical value, despite growing state laws, medical evidence and popular opinion to the contrary. The result: Pot is widely available in some states, heavily criminalized in others − and technically federally illegal everywhere.\n\nThe confusion could be cleared up by Congress or the courts intervening, said Carmel Shachar, Harvard School of Law professor and faculty director at the university's Health Law and Policy Clinic. But in the absence of bold congressional action on marijuana, experts and advocates are looking to the DEA to make the next move to change the nation's position on pot.\n\nWhile many states and physicians have recognized marijuana's potential medical benefits, there are still health risks associated with the substance under study, including a possible increase in risk of heart failure and heart attack. The potency and lack of regulation around marijuana has also led to concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden has said he's one of the people who disagrees with the DEA's categorization of marijuana. He called for a review in 2022, kicking off a bureaucratic slog that could soon change the status quo. Here's what to know:\n\nThe DEA classifies drugs and says pot is the worst kind\n\nThe DEA says marijuana is classified as a \"Schedule I\" drug under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nThe statute classifies drugs from Schedule I to Schedule V based on their potential for abuse, addictiveness and medical use. Schedule I drugs have \"high potential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical dependence\" and \"no currently accepted medical use,\" the DEA says.\n\nShachar said, \"Cocaine, morphine, and methamphetamines are all Schedule II, meaning they have been determined to have some medical value. It feels very strange to have marijuana be more restricted than these substances.\"\n\nPutting marijuana in Schedule I also places huge obstacles in the way of doing the kind of research that would be needed to prove there are medical uses, according to Heather Trela, director of operations and a fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government out of the State University of New York.\n\nHealth risks:Is marijuana more harmful to your lungs than cigarettes? A study suggests it may be.\n\nThat has created a feedback loop: It's hard to study pot to prove its medical value, because the federal government says it has no medical value.\n\nWhy is pot classified as the most dangerous? No good reason, experts say.\n\nMarijuana has been a Schedule I drug since the statute took effect in 1971, \"with very little medical or scientific evidence to demonstrate why it had to be Schedule I,\" Shachar said.\n\nAt the time, it had more to do with \"who uses the drug than the drug itself,\" Trela said.\n\nIt was under President Richard Nixon that marijuana was added to the list under the most restricted category – first only provisionally until more of the science could be settled, Trela said.\n\nYet even when a commission formed by Nixon determined weed shouldn't be criminalized, it remained in Schedule I. Trela said Nixon knew marijuana was a \"drug associated with the anti-war protesters, hippies and people of color – none of whom were fans of President Nixon and his agenda.\"\n\nA top adviser to Nixon, John Ehrlichman, said as much in an interview in 1994 that was published by Harper's Magazine in 2016: \"Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\"\n\nWhat could happen next? Will the DEA change its mind?\n\nThe next expected development is considered a small step, advocates say: The DEA is considering reclassifying marijuana as a lower-level controlled substance, but that wouldn't make it legal.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction but, in terms of its practical direction, it's really more symbolic,\" said Morgan Fox, political director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the country's oldest cannabis legalization advocacy group.\n\nIn 2022, Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services to review of how marijuana is classified. Last year, HHS recommended that cannabis be rescheduled as a Schedule III substance, like ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine.\n\nIf marijuana is placed on Schedule III instead, it would mean it could be legally prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed at licensed pharmacies. It also could help resolve a massive federal tax burden that has been placed on cannabis companies.\n\n\"It partially sends a signal that the federal government doesn't think cannabis is the worst of the worst drugs. 'Not as bad as heroin' − that's a good thing for the government to say,\" said Jay Wexler, a law professor at Boston University who wrote the book \"Weed Rules: Blazing the Way to a Just and Joyful Marijuana Policy.\"\n\nBut practically, rescheduling wouldn't have much of an effect on state cannabis programs at all, Wexler said, and \"everything states are doing is still a violation of federal law, and anybody who's selling, buying, processing, growing cannabis under these state programs is still in violation of federal law even if it's rescheduled.\"\n\nThe DEA did not give a time frame for if or when an announcement on rescheduling might come when reached by USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nWhat would it take to make marijuana fully legal in the US?\n\nTo eliminate the stark conflict between state and federal laws, marijuana would need to be removed from the Controlled Substances Act list altogether. Experts say there's a chance that could happen eventually, but it's still a long way off.\n\n\"I think it's going to take time, but I think we will get there,\" Trela said.\n\nJust as alcohol and tobacco are not considered controlled substances but are regulated by the federal government and by states, descheduling cannabis could have a similar effect, Wexler said.\n\nA group of Democratic senators – plus Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but joins with Democrats on major issues – wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and DEA Administrator Anne Milgram last month urging the descheduling of marijuana.\n\nWhat's taking so long?\n\nPublic support for the legalization of marijuana is at an all-time high, national polling has shown. A Gallup poll in the fall found 70% of Americans support legal weed. In 2022, Pew Research Center found just 10% of Americans believe it should be completely illegal. Thirty percent support medical use only, and 59% supported legalization for medical and recreational use.\n\nThat public support has been bumped by Americans seeing firsthand through loved ones and news stories that marijuana can have medical benefits for people with illnesses who can't get relief otherwise, Wexler said.\n\n\"Why doesn't that translate into clear political outcomes to deschedule cannabis? I don’t know,\" Wexler said.\n\nExperts said a combination of factors may be at play, including a desire to move toward full legalization incrementally. Legalization is also up against a number of top-line priorities, and support from the public and lawmakers is not uniform, Trela said.\n\n\"There is still a perception by many and belief that this is not where we should be going; the government should not be encouraging drug use, in their minds,\" Trela said. \"We're not that far removed from the stigma of marijuana.\"\n\nAdvocates hope weed will be removed from the Controlled Substances Act altogether someday, but it doesn't look as if marijuana will be legalized on the federal level anytime soon.\n\nSaid Wexler, \"Rescheduling is a step forward, but it is not nearly enough. And there's no reason to keep cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html", "title": "90% of US adults say mental health is a crisis in the United States ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNine out of 10 adults said ​they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

But when it comes to pregnant and parenting people, it’s still an incredibly stigmatized issue,” said Emilie Bruzelius, a researcher at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and co-author of the study. “It’s really important that pregnant people aren’t overlooked in some of the programs and policies that are being put in place to address overdose.”\n\nIn the new study, Bruzelius and Dr. Silvia Martins, director of Columbia University’s Substance Use Epidemiology Unit, tracked trends in the overdose mortality rate from 2017 to 2020 among both pregnant and postpartum people and compared that to others of reproductive age, between 15 and 44.\n\nThey found that the overdose mortality rate among pregnant and postpartum people has been lower than the rate for others of reproductive age, but it’s increasing faster for those who are pregnant or within one year of giving birth.\n\nIn 2020, there were about 12 pregnancy-associated overdose deaths for every 100,000 births – a 46% spike in one year and an 81% increase since 2017.\n\nThere were about 20 deaths for every 100,000 people in the broader reproductive age group, but the rate grew more slowly, increasing 38% since 2017.\n\nPregnancy-associated deaths are different from maternal mortality, in that they capture deaths among pregnant or recently pregnant people from all causes and not just those that are found to be directly related to pregnancy. Data like this has only been consistently available since 2017, when all 50 states included a checkbox on death certificates to indicate whether the individual was pregnant or postpartum at the time of death.\n\nThe lack of reliable information on pregnancy-associated overdose deaths has made it challenging to delve into how and why trends might be different for this group compared with others, Bruzelius said.\n\n“Moving forward, now that all states have implemented this pregnancy checkbox, hopefully we’ll have better information to track these trends overall and make better decisions on programs and policies that could try to mitigate some of these trends.”\n\nBarriers to treatment\n\nExperts say that pregnant and parenting people can experience harmful discrimination when seeking treatment for substance-use disorder. And other unique barriers to access – such as medical needs while pregnant or child care after birth – can keep them away from care and at higher risk for a fatal overdose.\n\n“Everybody that walks through our door cares about their health. But they’re scared to walk in our door because the stigma and the discrimination that they are facing in society – and sometimes in health care – is overwhelming,” said Hendrée Jones, executive director for UNC Horizons, a substance use disorder treatment program specifically for pregnant or parenting women and their children based out of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.\n\n“They’re scared that their child is going to be removed by child welfare once they have identified as needing help for substance use disorder. We’re seeing pregnant and parenting people that come in, that have overdosed three, four, up to 60 times previously before walking in our doors. And that can mean a lot of loss.”\n\nIn October, the Biden administration reported on their plan to “help facilitate universal access to treatment and reduce overdose deaths in pregnant women.”\n\nThe report highlighted earlier research that found that individuals posing as pregnant women with substance use disorder were 17% less likely to be accepted for outpatient treatment appointments than other women, and access to treatment can be even harder for women of color, those who live in rural areas and those who don’t speak English.\n\nIt also emphasized the importance of preventing unnecessary foster care placement, acknowledging that having substance use disorder in pregnancy is not, by itself, child abuse or neglect.\n\n“Addressing this crisis requires a holistic approach focused on the unique needs of the maternal-infant dyad, addressing social determinants of health, physical and mental health needs, and fostering collaboration across agencies and service providers at all levels (federal, state, local, Tribal),” according to the report.\n\nMore deaths involve fentanyl\n\nJones said that it’s rare for women to begin using drugs while they’re pregnant. Instead, it’s most often the case that women become pregnant while experiencing a substance use disorder and have a hard time stopping.\n\nMirroring national trends, the new study found a large increase in pregnancy-associated overdose deaths that involved fentanyl and other synthetic drugs and psychostimulants in recent years. Those involving benzodiazepines, heroin and prescription opioids remained mostly stable.\n\nRates were found to be higher among those in the late postpartum stage – between 6 weeks and one year after giving birth – compared with those who were pregnant or in the early postpartum stage at the time of death.\n\nMore work is needed to understand this difference, but Bruzelius suggests that relapse might be a contributing factor.\n\n“If someone is able to cease opioid use, for example, during pregnancy and then they relapse, they could have had a higher likelihood of fatal overdose,” she said – especially with the increase of deadlier drugs like fentanyl.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nExperts also point to the mental health challenges that face anyone experiencing the postpartum period.\n\n“Somebody that has just given birth has had an incredibly life-changing moment. And often the way our health care system deals with them is the focus really changes from the pregnant person to the baby. So right from the beginning, we’ve set up this adversarial relationship with the mother versus child,” Jones said.\n\n“Parenting, even in the best of circumstances, can be really stressful. And if you don’t have the support and care that you need, and the coping mechanisms that you need, it really sets you up for having much less positive outcomes.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/marijuana/2024/05/02/biden-reschedule-marijuana-deschedule-new-jersey-legal-weed/73531314007/", "title": "Biden Administration reschedules marijuana: How does it impact NJ?", "text": "WASHINGTON — Cannabis policy in the United States is a mess.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that the Drug Enforcement Administration was preparing to formally recommend rescheduling marijuana as a Schedule III drug. And just 24 hours later, three leading Democratic senators announced plans to reintroduce the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, a comprehensive bill that would end the federal prohibition on marijuana.\n\n\"Reclassifying cannabis is necessary and it's a long overdue step. But it is not the end of the story. It's not all we need to do,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer at a press conference on Wednesday. \"It's time for Congress to wake up to the times and do its part by passing the cannabis reform that most Americans have wished for. It's past time for Congress to catch up with public opinion and catch up with science.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 53% of Americans live in states where weed is already legal for adult use, and 75% live in states with at least medical marijuana laws. That doesn't even include the fact that, under a 2018 hemp bill, even corner convenience stores can carry and sell synthetic cannabinoids, such as Delta 8, and any product that contains less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.\n\nIf it seems like a lot to comprehend, you're not alone.\n\nTrying to navigate the legal weed landscape in 2024 is tricky. But with rescheduling on the docket and descheduling up for debate, here's what you need to know.\n\nMore:Why legal weed advocates aren't sold on Biden, DEA marijuana rescheduling\n\nSo, the DEA is rescheduling marijuana. What does that mean for me?\n\nIn short? Not much - especially in New Jersey.\n\nMarijuana is still going to remain illegal at the federal level but, with 24 states now legalizing cannabis for adult use, the places where this is really an issue are becoming more rare.\n\nFor example, you still can't light a joint in a national park. And those with a marijuana conviction could still be disqualified from federal housing, food benefits and face deportation, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for U.S. drug policy reform.\n\nAnd it's still a felony to transport drugs across state lines, even if you're traveling between two states with legal weed laws, like New Jersey and New York.\n\nMore:What to know about the federal government's big changes to marijuana rules coming soon\n\nThen why bother rescheduling marijuana at all?\n\nIt's a pretty huge first step, even if it's mostly symbolic.\n\nRescheduling marijuana as a Schedule III drug is a monumental moment in U.S. drug policy history. Cannabis has been listed as a Schedule I drug - with no medicinal value and a high potential for addiction - for over 50 years, and that status served as the basis for decades of the War on Drugs.\n\nPresident Joe Biden himself is considered by critics as an architect of that decades-long campaign; as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden authored or sponsored laws that instituted mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug crimes, including possession.\n\nBiden called for rescheduling in 2022 and has repeatedly said that no one should be jailed just for marijuana possession or use.\n\nThat doesn't mean rescheduling isn't without benefits. Cannabis businesses will no longer fall under Section 280E of IRS tax code, which prohibits businesses involved in the \"trafficking\" of Schedule I and Schedule II substances from deducting \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses from their taxes. That could result in lower prices for consumers and, at the least, make it easier for cannabis entrepreneurs to open and stay in business.\n\nSchedule III also, technically, allows for the medical prescription of cannabis - like other Schedule III drugs, such as ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine.\n\nThe only problem? The Food and Drug Administration hasn't actually approved cannabis for medical use - at least, not yet.\n\nMore:Biden administration plans to drastically change federal rules on marijuana\n\nWhat's the difference between rescheduling and descheduling?\n\nSchedule I drugs, like ecestasy, heroin and LSD, are determined to have no medicinal value with a high potential for addiction. Marijuana is getting rescheduled as a Schedule III drug, which means it has medicinal value witih a low to moderate potential for addiction.\n\nMarijuana legalization advocates are calling for the Biden Administration to instead completely remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act - to \"deschedule\" it entirely.\n\nIn broad terms, this would essentially decriminalize the drug on the federal level. The decision on whether to actually legalize weed would still be left up to states, but the federal government would tax and regulate it, as it does with alcohol and tobacco.\n\nWhy doesn't everyone want to legalize marijuana?\n\nLike any other drug, cannabis use can cause short-term and long-term effects.\n\nWhile the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, reports that there has never been a cannabis overdose, that doesn't mean the drug is without risk.\n\nA February study published in the Heart Association journal reported that people who used cannabis daily had a 25% higher risk of heart attack and a 42% higher chance of stroke compared to those who didn't use the drug at all.\n\nAnd according to NIDA, people who begin using cannabis at a young age can face permanent IQ loss, and long-term use has been associated with temporary paranoia, hallucinations and can exacerbate symptoms of disorders such as schizophrenia.\n\nSmoking marijuana has a similar health impact to tobacco smoke, according to the institute, including respiratory issues such as a daily cough, phlegm and a higher risk of lung infections. But it's unclear if the drug leads to a greater risk of lung cancer.\n\n\"A drug isn’t medicine because it’s popular,\" said former White House Office of National Drug Control Policy advisor Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, the leading anti-legalization group. \"The Administration's effort to push through this action in an election year could be perceived as a thinly veiled attempt to reverse polling trends with the principal targets of the pot industry, namely young people.\"\n\nIn recommending the Department of Health and Human Services reschedule cannabis, scientists said cannabis users could develop moderate to low physical dependence and some psychological dependence but that withdrawal symptoms are \"relatively mild\" compared to alcohol.\n\nWould the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act fully legalize weed?\n\nIn short: This is the big one.\n\nThe day the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act becomes law would be one of the most important, impactful days in American history. As written, the bill would:\n\nDeschedule cannabis, eliminating the federal prohibition in legal weed states and placing federal jurisdiction under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.\n\nExpunge nonviolent marijuana offenses and allow those in prison to petition for resentencing.\n\nEstablish grant programs and expedited review processes for cannabis businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. (In state legal weed laws, these usually mean people with marijuana arrests or those from or opening up shop in communities with large Black and Hispanic populations with a high rate of marijuana arrests.).\n\nRemove \"unnecessary\" pre-employment and random drug testing for cannabis.\n\nRequire the FDA to establish labeling production and labeling standards.\n\nHere's the problem: Turning a bill into a law is subject to a lot of mitigating factors that, often, have nothing to do with the bill itself. And turning a bill into a law relatively unscathed - for example, protecting much of the details in the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act - is nearly impossible.\n\n\"To walk around in an institution where colleagues of mine have admitted openly about their marijuana use and, meanwhile, young people in this country - African Americans and Latinos - can't get jobs for doing the same things that presidents and senators and congresspeople have done is the height of hypocrisy,\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J, said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThere's reason to be hopeful, though.\n\nThe fact that the Senate Majority Leader backs a bill to legalize weed is a big deal. And support in the Senate has grown since Booker and Wyden introduced it in 2022. Now, the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act has 18 sponsors in the Senate.\n\nBut they're all Democrats, despite voters in both parties largely supporting marijuana legalization. Legalizing marijuana on the federal level is going to require a number of Republicans to buy in, along with near-unanimous support by Democrats.\n\n\"What happened yesterday (the DEA recommending rescheduling marijuana) is really a kick in the pants,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. \"Descheduling is a Republican's dream. This is a monument to state's rights.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Jeanine Santucci, Michael Collins, Eduardo Cuevas, and Joel Shannon contributed to this report.\n\nMike Davis has spent the last decade covering New Jersey local news, marijuana legalization, transportation and basically whatever else is going on at any given moment.

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Is melatonin bad for you? Usage is on the rise despite health risks ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

The initiative is meant to increase access to Covid-19 treatment, particularly for those in socially vulnerable or medically underserved communities.\n\nMillions of Americans get prescriptions through the mail, a service that research has shown is used more frequently among seniors, adults with poor health and others who are also at high risk of severe outcomes for Covid-19.\n\nBut Paxlovid is most effective when taken within five days of symptoms starting, making timely treatment a critical piece of the puzzle and traditional mail-order delivery too slow.\n\nWalgreens also plans to expand the service to include HIV treatment – in line with the Biden administration’s goals to accelerate efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US.\n\nAs with Paxlovid, early uptake is key with HIV treatment. And people who miss doses of HIV treatment risk developing drug resistance, making it crucial that they stick with the prescription.\n\n“There are places across the patient journey that would divert a patient from being able to get treated and back to feeling better. But that’s where our teams have been working on really understanding that patient journey and then offering and identifying solutions to help address that,” said Rina Shah, vice president of pharmacy strategy at Walgreens.\n\nRite Aid adopted a prescription delivery program during the Covid-19 pandemic through a partnership with ScriptDrop. Service fees are currently waived for all eligible prescriptions, which excludes controlled substances and refrigerated medications but includes Paxlovid.\n\nCVS also has one- or two-day delivery in most locations and on-demand delivery at some, which is provided free to people enrolled in the membership program.\n\nBalancing priorities\n\nIn March, the Biden administration launched a federal Test-to-Treat initiative that streamlined access to Paxlovid for people who had Covid-19, with testing and prescribing all happening in one visit. In May, the program was broadened to specifically reach more vulnerable communities.\n\nKhazanchi was author of a study published last month that found that Black and Hispanic people were more likely to live closer to Test-to-Treat sites than White people. But despite the physical proximity, these groups were less likely to get outpatient Covid-19 therapeutics – even though they’re at elevated risk of infection and severe disease.\n\nEven if someone has a car or another way to get to the doctor’s office, pharmacy or other Test-to-Treat location, they’re often challenged by the time required to make that trip, said Dr. Rachel Werner, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics.\n\n“It’s a combination of things that prevent access to care,” said Werner, whose research has focused on health equity. “Often, people have to take time off of work to do that, and they don’t always have paid sick leave. Everyone’s lives are complicated, and sometimes it’s hard to balance competing priorities.”\n\nExpanding the possibilities of health care\n\nAccording to a report from health analytics company IQVIA, 9% of all new prescriptions in 2019 were “abandoned” at pharmacies, representing a gap in physician-recommended care that was not received by the patient. But home delivery programs that have expanded throughout the Covid-19 pandemic may help.\n\n“I think it may be important to think about other medications or conditions where the time to treatment really matters. And those may be the ones that I think would be ripe for this kind of home-based delivery system,” Werner said. “These are urgent things that people might otherwise show up to an urgent clinic or ER for and instead could just get a medication.”\n\nWith the expansion of things like telehealth and options for home care, experts say, the Covid-19 pandemic helped widen the picture of what health care can look like.\n\n“For far too long, we’ve been bound by the idea that health care is something that occurs within the four walls of a hospital or clinic,” Werner said. “What the Covid pandemic really did, which is important, is it made people realize that health care should be accessible where and when people need it, and it doesn’t have to be delivered in the physical structure of a health care setting.”\n\nExperts say that while it’s critical to break down barriers in terms of access to medication, it’s important to also address the issue of trust.\n\nIn the research about accessibility to Test-to-Treat sites, Khazanchi and his co-authors suggested that programs should leverage trusted community stakeholders like local health-care providers for in-person outreach and other “low-tech, high-touch” methods to ensure equitable use.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDr. Kedar Mate, president and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, thinks about it in terms of supply and demand.\n\n“Getting treatments to people who need them is principally an issue around access and ensuring that the supply goes to where the people are,” he said. “There’s a different problem, though, on the demand side. Are patients willing or interested to get tested and then get treated if they are found to be positive? That has everything to do with a totally different set of challenges which have to do with trust, information, disinformation, misinformation and belief in the health system overall.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}]}

This record comes only a year after countries agreed to phase down their use of coal at the United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow.\n\nThe growth is mostly down to a rapid rise in the prices of natural gas and other fuels, which has forced some countries and regions to turn to coal as a cheaper alternative.\n\nCoal is the world’s largest source of energy for electricity generation and the production of steel and cement. But it is also the biggest single contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for around 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use.\n\n“Europe – and the European Union in particular – has been one of the regions hardest hit by the energy crisis, given its reliance on Russian pipeline supplies of natural gas,” the report said, adding that technical problems in French nuclear power plants made the problem even worse.\n\nTo keep the lights on, Europe turned back to coal – even switching some of its recently closed coal power plants back on.\n\nPieter de Pous, who leads the Fossil Fuel Transition Program at E3G, a climate think tank, told CNN the growth in coal use was a U-turn, coming “at the end of a decade that saw coal use cut in half.”\n\nThe IEA said that while the increase in coal consumption was relatively modest in most European countries, Germany saw a reversal of a “significant scale.”\n\nThat has put the EU, which has positioned itself as a global climate leader, into an uncomfortable position, with some criticizing European countries like Germany for only pursuing the green agenda when it suits them. Germany and the EU have pushed back on that idea, stressing the U-turn was only temporary and that the bloc has significantly ramped up its investment into renewable energy.\n\nThe IEA expects the EU’s coal use to drop 29% by 2025 compared to 2022, de Pous said. “This will be the result of action taken in as many as 19 EU countries to accelerate renewables,” he added.\n\nChina, which accounts for more than half of global coal consumption, also ramped up its use of coal earlier this year, when the worst heatwave and drought in six decades hit its hydroelectricity production.\n\nIn August alone, coal power generation in China increased by around 15% compared to the same period last year, the IEA said, to a level of generation that was higher than the total annual coal power generation of any other country, except India and the United States.\n\nRichard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a climate advisory group, said that despite the increase in China’s use of coal, the long term direction for coal in China and India – another major coal user – was clear.\n\n“Renewables are going to be providing an increasing share of the generation and the role of coal is going to transition from being a baseload fuel to being a backup,” he said.\n\n“The science suggests that a country such as China ought to have eliminated unabated coal use by 2040 and ideally earlier than that,” he said. “That’s absolutely feasible. As with Europe, if there is a short term increase in coal use, that’s not necessarily a disaster. The key thing is going to be to build out transmission capacity, build out energy storage, keep on making energy use more efficient, and to provide alternatives for the workers in the places where coal mining is a big employer so that there’s a socially just transition.”\n\n‘Peak in fossil fuel use’\n\nThe IEA forecasts that global coal consumption will remain flat at the current level to 2025 as falls in some countries are offset by continued strong demand in emerging Asian economies. Although there are global moves to help big coal producing countries transition off the fossil fuel. This week, Vietnam agreed to a $15.5 billion climate-financing deal with leaders from G7 industrialized nations to move away from coal, which followed a recent $20 billion funding deal for Indonesia to increase clean energy and phase out coal.\n\n“The world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, with coal set to be the first to decline, but we are not there yet,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security, said in a press release.\n\nEarlier this year, the IEA said CO2 emissions from coal power generation were forecast to grow by more than 200 million tons, or 2%, this year. It said that investment into new fossil fuels infrastructure must stop immediately if the world wants any chance of achieving net zero by 2050.\n\nThe latest climate science shows that achieving net zero by the mid-century is necessary to keep temperatures from rising well above 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with pre-industrial times.

Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe life cycle of plastic begins underground, where oil and gas are extracted from deep below the surface of the planet. These fossil fuels are then refined in facilities, using extreme temperatures and significant amount of water and energy, where they are transformed into pellets that are eventually melted and molded into things like water bottles, packaging, garbage bags and clothes.\n\nAnd the widespread use of single-use plastic — the stuff we use once and then throw away — is only made worse by its disposal. Plastics do not break down once they’re thrown into nature. And, alarmingly, only around 9% plastic in the United States is actually recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — even the stuff you specifically threw into the recycle bin.\n\nWhat you might not realize is this isn’t just a pollution problem. It’s a climate problem. And by the time we start talking about recycling, the damage is already done.\n\nThe process of making plastic is so energy intensive that if the plastics industry were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, according to a 2021 report from Beyond Plastics.\n\nPlastics are the “new coal,” said Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics. Generating energy from coal — the most polluting fossil fuel — is already being phased out. But Enck said it’s likely that plastics may be sticking for a while longer, unless consumers significant cut their plastic use.\n\n“It’s a climate killer,” Enck told CNN. “We’re finally seeing an increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And the fossil fuel industry knew that they were losing market share on transportation and electricity generation, so plastic production is the plan B for the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nFrom its production to its end-of-life, plastic belches greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its life cycle. Here’s why experts say the convenience of plastic comes at a terrible cost for the climate, and what you can do to help reduce its impact.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nSwitch to reusable bags for shopping to cut down on single-use plastic. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nThe plastic industry is responsible for at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions each year, according to the Beyond Plastics report.\n\nThat’s the same amount as the average emissions released by 116 coal-fired power plants in 2020, according to the report’s authors. It’s also the same annual emissions as around 50 million cars, according to the EPA. And more plastic-making facilities continue to come online.\n\n“Remember that when you’re making plastic, there’s the greenhouse gas emissions, but these facilities also emit massive amounts of air toxins and particulates,” Enck added. “It’s really a health threat.”\n\nRefineries and production facilities also tend to set up shop in marginalized communities of color, Enck said.\n\n“If you look at where more than 90% of the climate pollution is released by the plastic industry, it’s in 18 communities in the whole country, and they’re all low-income communities and the residents are more likely to be people of color,” Enck said, outlining other findings in the report. “Plastic production is an environmental justice issue.”\n\nAnd plastic recycling doesn’t work, Enck said, because most of what we think we’re recycling just ends up in the landfill. It also doesn’t address the planet-warming emissions that comes from making it in the first place.\n\nJacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for Oceana in North America, said people should think of the plastic crisis as an overflowing bathtub.\n\n“When the bathtub is overflowing, you don’t want to just run for the mop; first, you want to turn off the faucet,” Savitz said. “Recycling is the mop. You’re not going to get very far, if the faucet is still on. So what we have to do is reduce the amount of plastics that we’re producing at the source, and that’s turning off the faucet.”\n\nWhat you can do about it\n\nSaying \"no\" to plastic cutlery is one way to limit your use of single-use plastic. Adobe Stock\n\nRecycling alone will not solve this massive problem, Enck said, but we should still do it — bearing in mind what can and cannot be recycled.\n\nThe number system on the bottom of plastic items are not a guarantee they will be recycled. Only things marked 1 and 2 — and on rare occasion, 5 — are sure bets, depending on what your municipality can handle.\n\nThis is why it’s so important to focus on reducing plastic use in the first place, Enck said, and our individual changes can add up.\n\n“It’s just not going to solve the problem unless we change the law,” Enck said. “But with individual actions, what I urge people to do is look at their own home or their worksite — what is your heaviest use of plastic?”\n\nYou won’t know what you can change until you take stock. Make note of all of the plastics in your home. Most of the single-use stuff you’ll find around the kitchen and the bathroom. Then, armed with a list of where you use single-use plastic the most, you can start to make replacements.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nSay no to bottled water — Get a couple of canteens and cut a major source of plastic out of your life.\n\nReusable grocery bags — You can easily go a step further by not using the plastic produce bags the store provides for your apples and broccoli. If you’re uncomfortable putting produce directly in the cart, have a special bag to carry it in until you get to the checkout. There’s no rule that says you have to wrap your fruits and veggies at the store.\n\nChoose paper (or no) packaging over plastic — If you’re looking at two versions of the same product and one is packaged in paper or cardboard and the other is in plastic, then the choice is obvious. And look for plastic-free options like bar shampoo.\n\nBuy in bulk to reduce plastic waste — Nuts, rice and beans are all things that come in plastic bags, but they don’t need to. Bring your own reusable containers to fill with your favorite bulk foods. (Just make sure to zero-out the scale before you start filling them, so you don’t pay for the weight of your container.)\n\nRefuse plastic cutlery — Take your own utensils to restaurants that typically provide plastics. Or, if you’re ordering takeout, tell the restaurant they don’t need to add it to your bag.\n\nAnd Enck’s group has more suggestions for how to cut your personal plastic use.\n\nThink bigger\n\nWe can do our part to minimize our own plastic use, but the world needs big solutions for this big problem. Natan Dvir/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nUltimately, the world needs large-scale change to address the climate impact of the fossil fuel and plastics industries, Savitz said. Oceana, for example, is working with local volunteers from cities and counties around the country to help pass new laws to reduce single-use plastics, in hopes of sparking change at the national level.\n\n“We think that if we could start to reduce single-use plastics at the local level with local ordinances, that can start to become more of the norm,” she said. “Then we can start taking it to higher levels of government, even getting to the point of getting national policies that will drive reductions in plastic use.”\n\nUltimately, Savitz said consumers need to continue urging major corporations to provide plastic-free solutions and help support refill and reuse programs to encourage society to shy away from plastic use and stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n“Our country is burning and flooding and hurricanes are coming earlier and earlier,” she told CNN. “I really think it’s shocking that one of the things that’s really leading to that is plastics, and it’s hurting us in other ways, too. So if we could find a way to reduce our production of plastics as a country and as a global society, we’d be taking a bite out of climate change.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/07/oil-and-gas-role-climate-change-highlighted-global-report-new-mexico-permian-basin/9475323002/", "title": "Oil and gas' role in climate change highlighted in global report", "text": "Oil and gas production could be leading the world in climate change impacts brought on by pollution, per a recent international report that led to New Mexico environmentalists calling for reforms to fossil fuel policy.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a global body of policymakers formed by the United Nations, released its third and final climate change report this week in its sixth assessment to analyze the causes, impacts and remedies throughout the world.\n\nThe latest report focused on how ongoing human-driven pollution could affect climate change and evaluated efforts from nations to combat the effects.\n\nMore:Fluctuating oil prices do not hamper February oil and gas tax collections for Eddy County\n\nA main source of the emissions, per the report, was the fossil fuel industry, which accounted for most of the U.S.’ 23 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1850 and 2019.\n\nAnd even as technological advancements and evolving practices used in oil and gas operations were developed to capture more gas, the report argued that impact was less than the increase in air pollution caused by increasing extraction and other industrial activities along with worldwide economic growth.\n\n“Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings,” the report read.\n\nMore:Permian Basin the site of oil and gas expansion to lower gas prices amid Russia conflict\n\nIn total, about a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions came from the energy sector in 2019, the report read.\n\nFossil fuel was mentioned 40 times in the report's 63-page summary for policymakers, and mitigating emissions from this industry was a frequent topic and suggested means of mitigating climate change.\n\nNew Mexico looks to reduce fossil fuel pollution. Is it enough?\n\nTo the State of New Mexico, that meant two separate rulemakings: one to retrofit oil and gas operations to capture 98 percent of produced gas by 2026 and end routine flaring, or the burning of excess gas, and another to increase monitoring, leak detection and repairs at oil and gas sites across the state.\n\nMore:Heinrich, U.S. senators urge Biden to transition from oil and gas amid Russia conflict\n\nThese efforts, environmentalists argued, must be joined by adequate funding for New Mexico’s Environment Department and its Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department – the two agencies tasked with enforcing the new rules.\n\nBut Jeremy Nichols with Santa Fe-based environmental group WildEarth Guardians said the IPCC report indicated such regulations, developed with input from oil and gas companies and trade groups, would not be enough to prevent a global climate crisis and New Mexico’s contribution.\n\nHe said the state and world should move past fossil fuels, seeking a transition to less-polluting energy sources like renewable power from wind and solar.\n\nMore:Permian Basin land sought after by oil and gas companies Russia conflict grows fuel demand\n\nNichols said that while New Mexico took some steps to address environmental damage caused by extraction, the State was still complicit in ongoing oil and gas operations and industrial growth.\n\nLast year, New Mexico became the U.S.’ second-largest producer of oil – second only to Texas – and its operations centered in the Permian Basin region in the southeast continued to grow in step with recovering fuel demand at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply disruptions amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The latest IPCC report clearly confirms the need to rapidly transition from fossil fuels,” Nichols said. Unfortunately, while New Mexico has taken some steps to move beyond coal and encourage renewable energy development, the state continues to back unfettered oil and gas development.”\n\nMore:Permian Basin oil and gas pollution could boom amid Russia conflict\n\nThe environmental impacts of New Mexico oil and gas operations, which provide strong economic growth for local communities like Carlsbad and Hobbs in the southeast corner of the state and windfalls of revenue for State coffers, would be felt across the nation and world, Nichols said.\n\n“This isn't just fueling more air and climate pollution within New Mexico but exporting massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions to other states and even other countries,” he said.\n\n“While New Mexico has taken steps to curb methane from oil and gas development, the latest IPCC report underscores that to truly confront the climate crisis, we need to start keeping fossil fuels in the ground.”\n\nMore:Oil and gas land sales in southeast New Mexico could resume after federal court ruling\n\nCamilla Feibelman, director of the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club in New Mexico said the industry, despite the risk it poses to the environment and public safety, continued to hold an outsized role in state policy even amid increasing dire warnings from the international scientific community.\n\nShe worried industry lobbyists were able to block environmental bills like the Clean Future Act in this year’s legislative session that would have added benchmarks for greenhouse gas reductions.\n\nThat bill passed two committees in the New Mexico House of Representatives, but never saw a vote on the House Floor.\n\nMore:Oil and gas companies face $275K in fines for not reporting methane pollution in New Mexico\n\nAnother bill, the Clean Fuel Standard Act, would have required fuel producers to meet emission caps but was killed in a deadlocked vote on the House Floor that could have sent it to the governor’s desk.\n\nAnd House Joint Memorial 2, which would have placed a ballot question before voters to codify “environmental rights” into state law was stalled in the House Judiciary Committee while the senate equivalent never advanced.\n\n“Despite the urgency of the crisis facing our children and grandchildren, we continue to coddle an oil and gas industry that cuts jobs despite increasing profit and production,” Feibelman said. “We hear over and over from oil and gas giants how much we need them.\n\n“The truth is that even across political ideologies, Americans say we need climate action and to end our dependence on oil and gas. No matter our political party.”\n\nMore:Permian Basin oil and gas could fill gap left by Russia's removal from global market\n\nFeibelman pointed to a recent study from Stanford University reporting methane emissions in the Permian were higher than previously believed, accounting for an about 9 percent loss rate for natural gas produced during extraction of oil.\n\nAddressing this source of air pollution should be at the forefront, she said, of stopping New Mexico role in the looming, global climate crisis.\n\n“One of New Mexico's biggest sources of climate pollution — and one of our most powerful tools to act — is methane reduction,” Feibelman said.\n\n“Methane is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a heat-trapping gas but disappears from the atmosphere much more quickly. That means slashing methane emissions can have a real and relatively rapid effect.”\n\nSign up for our newsletter, the Daily Briefing, to get stories like this one delivered straight to your inbox every morning.\n\nAdrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2021/02/09/harvard-links-fossil-fuels-deaths-california-approves-fracking/4436589001/", "title": "Harvard links fossil fuels deaths as California approves fracking", "text": "New research published Tuesday by researchers at Harvard University and several colleges in the United Kingdom found that pollution from burning fossil fuels could be blamed for 8.7 million premature deaths in 2018 alone, about one-fifth of all deaths that year.\n\nChina and India — the two most populous countries in the world as well as two of the top coal-burners — accounted for roughly half of all excess deaths identified in the study. The eastern U.S. and several other regions around the world, including Europe and Southeast Asia, had high levels, as well. The vast majority of American coal-fired power plants that are operational and not slated for retirement are in the eastern half of the lower 48.\n\nThe report focused on PM2.5, which is fine particulate matter that can get deep into the lungs and cause cardiac and pulmonary issues. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, PM2.5 exposure has been linked to asthma, an irregular heartbeat, heart attacks and death. While the research did not estimate specific causes of death, it cited research on PM2.5's impacts, including how it disproportionately hurts children's health via issues such as respiratory infections.\n\nThe study also did not quantify how many years fossil fuel pollution would take off an average person's life, although other recent research estimated that all types of PM2.5 pollution caused the loss of 103.1 million life-years globally in 2015.\n\nThousands of the deaths this new study highlighted came from California. The Golden State's oil and gas industry has been shrinking since the 1980s, although it still remains one of the country's larger producers. The state also extended the life of four natural gas power plants in 2020 due to concerns over electricity blackouts.\n\nMillions of Californians live near oil and gas well and refineries, both of which can leak dangerous pollutants. Black, Latino and low-income people are most likely to live adjacent to these wells.\n\nWhile it has historically been difficult to differentiate between various sources of PM2.5 in similar studies, this team relied on a \"global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry\" to isolate emissions originating locally from burning fossil fuels.\n\n“Our study adds to the mounting evidence that air pollution from ongoing dependence on fossil fuels is detrimental to global health,” Eloise Marais, an associate professor in the Department of Geography at University College London and one of the report's co-authors, said in a statement. “We can’t in good conscience continue to rely on fossil fuels, when we know that there are such severe effects on health and viable, cleaner alternatives.”\n\nThe research team shared data with The Desert Sun that broke out the mortality figures at a state-by-state level across the U.S. Topping the list of the states hit hardest per capita were those in the Rust Belt, where coal has historically been king.\n\nPennsylvania experienced the worst outcomes, with 195 excess deaths per 100,000 people. Next were Ohio with 188, Michigan with 177, Indiana with 176, Kentucky with 169 and West Virginia with 158.\n\nCalifornia, which has committed to going carbon neutral by 2045, was in the lower half of per capita premature deaths. Still, the researchers estimated that slightly more than 34,000 Californians died prematurely due to this pollution, which came out to about 86 deaths per 100,000 people in the country's most populous state.\n\nThe California oil industry argued that shutting down U.S. fossil fuels too quickly would be dangerous, as domestic energy sources were cleaner than the alternatives coming from countries with laxer environmental laws.\n\nRock Zierman, CEO of the California Independent Petroleum Association, pointed out that the report didn't mention California specifically, \"likely because the state has the toughest regulations on the planet to protect air quality.\"\n\nHe added, \"Continuing to meet the state’s vast energy needs with locally produced energy is better for our environment and our economy.\"\n\nKevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, agreed that a transition away shouldn't be rushed, saying, \"There is a path to an energy future that is equitable, reliable affordable and safe — but not without oil and gas.\"\n\nFor their part, the research team used their study as a call to action to move on from burning hydrocarbons.\n\n\"Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM2.5 such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy,\" they wrote.\n\nMore fracking in California\n\nHarvard's research came out the same day California approved 11 new hydraulic fracturing — or \"fracking\" — permits, according to data from the California Geologic Energy Management Division. The permits — allowing for 59 individual fracking events — fall in the North Belridge oil field, which is west of Bakersfield in Kern County.\n\nThe permits approved Tuesday went to Aera Energy, a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil. Gov. Gavin Newsom has come under criticism for allowing his administration to approve so many such permits for Aera, which has contracted with the lobbying firm where his close friend Jason Kinney works.\n\nEnvironmentalists saw a clear link between continued oil and gas drilling and the adverse health outcomes the study pointed out.\n\n“This research shows the deadly consequences of every fracking and drilling permit issued by the Newsom administration and every delay in putting setbacks between people and drilling sites,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy organization.\n\n“But,\" she continued, \"it also shows that the way to save lives is to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Gov. Newsom has the power to be a true lifesaver, but he has to rein in California’s dirty oil production to do it.”\n\nMark Olalde covers the environment for The Desert Sun.

As global temperature rises, Antarctica’s pristine landscape is already changing, and new research shows most of the region’s plant and animal species – including its iconic penguins – are in trouble.\n\nThe study published Thursday in the journal PLOS Biology found that 65% of Antarctica’s native species, emperor penguins top among them, will likely disappear by the end of the century if the world continues its business-as-usual ways and fails to rein in planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThe study also showed that the current conservation efforts in Antarctica are not working on the rapidly changing continent. Researchers concluded implementing an extra layer of cost-effective strategies, which they lay out in the study, could save up to 84% of Antarctica’s vulnerable biodiversity.\n\n“Antarctica is not really contributing to climate change; there’s not a large-scale number of people living there, so the greatest threat to the continent is coming from outside the continent,” Jasmine Lee, lead author of the study, told CNN. “We really need global action on climate change, as well as some more local and regional conservation efforts, to give Antarctic species the best chance of surviving into the future.”\n\nEmperor penguin chicks waddle across the ice in Antarctica. Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAntarctica’s geographic isolation has long protected the continent from the worsening impacts of the climate crisis and other environmental disasters that plague the rest of the world, such as wildfires, flooding, and drought. Scientists have already observed significant changes in its northern counterpart, the Arctic, which is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet.\n\nBut the impacts of climate change are just starting to emerge in Antarctica. Recent data, for example, suggests Antarctica’s sea ice is dropping more rapidly now than decades prior.\n\nThursday’s study shows that disappearing sea ice threatens several species of marine seabirds, like emperor and Adélie penguins, that rely on the ice from April through December to nest their little ones. If the ice melts earlier or freezes later in the season, as a result of rising temperatures, penguins struggle to complete their reproductive cycle.\n\n“These iconic species, like emperor penguins and Adélie penguins, are at risk and it’s really sad to think that Antarctica is one of the last great wildernesses on the planet and human impacts are being seen and felt there,” Lee said. “It’s just incredibly sad to think that we could drive those kinds of species towards extinction.”\n\nHuman presence and activity are also increasing in the region. The study shows that scientific expeditions and infrastructure are expanding, while annual tourist numbers have skyrocketed more than eight-fold since the 1990s.\n\nA separate study from earlier this year showed that increasing human presence in the region is causing more snow melt. Scientists found black carbon – the dark, dusty pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels – settling in locations where people spend a lot of time. Even the tiniest amount of this pollutant can have a significant impact on melting.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTourists taking pictures of a Barbijo penguin on Half Moon island in Antarctica in 2019. Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the threat to Antarctica’s species and its ecosystem are increasingly well-documented, they aren’t as widely understood among policymakers, Lee said. And finding the funds for conservation can be challenging.\n\nBut the study lays out several measures that are actually cost-effective, with an estimated cost of $1.92 billion over the next 83 years, or around $23 million per year – a fraction of the global economy.\n\nThese strategies include minimizing and managing human activity, transport and new infrastructure, as well as protecting native species while also controlling non-native species and diseases that enter the region.\n\nIt also includes a focus on external policies, like achieving the broader international climate goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aim to reduce planet-warming emissions and stave off a dire rise in global temperature.\n\nAdelie penguins on sea ice in East Antarctica in 2010. Pauline Askin/Reuters\n\n“The benefits of doing something about climate change is good for human health, livelihood and also the economy,” Lee said. “The incentive is there, but it’s just finding that initial investment, and it just depends on priorities.”\n\nCassandra Brooks, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has done extensive research on marine animals in Antarctica, said that the study is “timely and important” to draw attention to how critically threatened Antarctic biodiversity is.\n\n“This study builds on previous work showing the urgency with which policymakers need to take action on climate change, if there is any chance of safeguarding Antarctic biodiversity,” Brooks, who is not involved with the study, told CNN. It “makes crystal clear that current conservation strategies are insufficient at doing anything beyond supporting the decline of biodiversity.”\n\nThe latest research comes days after negotiators at the UN biodiversity summit in Montreal reached a landmark agreement to better protect the planet’s vital ecosystems, including a pledge to protect 30% of land and oceans by 2030.\n\nWith the climate crisis now the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity, Lee said influencing global policy is needed more than ever to save one of Earth’s vast, pristine biomes.\n\n“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Lee said. “We’re at this huge turning point now not just for Antarctica, but globally, when it comes to climate.

Desert Sun\n\nPALM SPRINGS, Calif. — With his choice of administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, Donald Trump shattered any hope that he would moderate his stance on climate change.\n\nScott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, has spent six years waging war against the EPA's climate and clean air initiatives. He's often done so in close coordination with the fossil fuel industry, which has given him nearly $300,000 in campaign contributions during his political career. And like Trump, Pruitt has dismissed the world's most daunting environmental challenge, rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus that human beings are heating the planet by burning coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nTrump has long insisted climate change is a hoax, but he had seemed willing to soften his views over the last few weeks. He acknowledged there is \"some connectivity\" between human activity and rising temperatures, and he indicated he might not pull out of the international Paris climate deal, as he'd promised to do during the presidential campaign. He even met with former Vice President Al Gore, a vocal climate advocate.\n\nNow, with his selection of Pruitt, the president-elect has made clear what kind of policy his administration will pursue.\n\nScott Pruitt, Trump's pick to head the EPA, has sued the EPA\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn a statement announcing the decision Thursday, Trump's transition team praised Pruitt as \"a national leader against the EPA’s job-killing war on coal.\"\n\n\"For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn,\" Trump said in the statement.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the EPA during President George W. Bush's first term, said she was disappointed by Pruitt's selection. Like several other former EPA chiefs who served under Republican presidents, Whitman has called for immediate action to combat global warming, and criticized Trump for refusing to accept climate science.\n\n“Everyone talks about how bad regulations are, but regulations are protections. The other words for them is protections,\" Whitman said in an interview. \"We need to remember that.\"\n\nPruitt has fought President Obama's climate and clean air regulations, usually decrying them as federal overreach and too costly to businesses and energy consumers. He unsuccessfully sued the EPA over a 2011 rule to limit emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants, which the agency estimates will save up to 11,000 lives and prevent 4,700 heart attacks and 130,000 asthma attacks per year. More recently, he sued the EPA over a regulation designed to reduce the amount of smog-forming, lung-damaging ozone in the air. That case is pending.\n\nThose lawsuits are the tip of the iceberg. Pruitt sued the EPA over its regional haze rule, which limits coal-plant pollution that muddies the air in national parks and wildlife refuges. He sued the agency over a regulation to cut down on smog that crosses state lines. He sued over the agency's \"waters of the United States\" rule, which expands the number of waterways covered by the Clean Water Act. (None of those lawsuits has been successful.) Pruitt also opposes an Interior Department rule that would regulate hydraulic fracturing, a controversial drilling technique, on public lands.\n\nMichael Gerrard, an environmental law expert who leads Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, called Pruitt's appointment \"a stick in the eye to EPA.\"\n\n\"He has cultivated a reputation as a fighter against all of EPA's major recent initiatives. It's going to be profoundly demoralizing to the EPA staff,\" Gerrard said.\n\nOn climate change, Pruitt has helped lead the charge against Obama's EPA. He's one of 27 state attorneys general suing the agency over Obama's signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants and other sources. The Supreme Court has blocked the plan while a lower court hears the case. Pruitt also recently joined a lawsuit against a separate EPA rule to slash emissions of methane, a short-lived but powerful climate pollutant released by oil and gas facilities.\n\nPruitt's actions have been informed by a fundamentally incorrect view of climate science. He wrote earlier this year that the debate over global warming is \"far from settled,\" even though virtually all scientists actively researching the issue agree that human-caused emissions are heating the planet. The consequences of climate change, which are already being felt around the world, have included deadlier heat waves, fast-rising seas, more extreme droughts and wildfires, bigger food shortages in the developing world and the spread of diseases to new geographic areas.\n\n\"Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind,\" Pruitt wrote in an op-ed for the conservative National Review, coauthored with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange.\n\nIt's possible Pruitt's view of climate science is more willful ignorance than misunderstanding.\n\nEnvironmentalists have slammed Pruitt's ties to the fossil fuel industry. Since 2002, when he was serving in the Oklahoma Senate, he has received $271,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry and $25,000 from the coal industry, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. He has also worked closely with fossil fuel companies in his campaigns against federal regulation. The New York Times reported in 2014 he sent the Obama administration letters drafted by oil and gas lobbyists, copying the text onto state stationary and adding his signature.\n\nMichael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement that putting Pruitt in charge of the EPA would be like \"putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires.\" Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat who serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Pruitt's record \"shows disdain for the EPA's mission and ignorance of its importance.\"\n\n\"He is willing to mouth whatever message big fossil fuel companies want to convey — to the letter,\" Whitehouse said in a statement.\n\nFossil fuel advocates and their political allies celebrated Pruitt's selection, saying they expect him to reduce federal regulation and leave more environmental decisions to the states. Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, a Republican and staunch climate denier, said in a statement Pruitt has \"fought back against unconstitutional and overzealous environmental regulations.\"\n\nTodd Staples, president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association, put it this way: \"Scott Pruitt understands that the states are best suited to implement oil and natural gas regulation.\"\n\nWhile Pruitt has fought Obama's environmental rules, actually undoing them would be difficult, said David Spence, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies energy law and regulation. Many of the rules EPA has issued under Obama, including those to reduce climate pollution, were required by the Clean Air Act, so Pruitt would need to redo expensive, time-consuming rulemaking processes to get them off the books. Those processes are supposed to be governed by science, so any questionable conclusions could be challenged in court by environmental groups.\n\nAnother complicating factor: In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, if the agency were to find that those emissions endanger public health and welfare. The agency made such a finding in 2009. If Pruitt were to try reversing that \"endangerment finding,\" the decision might not hold up in court.\n\n\"You'd have to make a conclusion that science doesn’t really support. That's a hard call to make, that greenhouse gases don’t endanger the public welfare,\" Spence said.\n\nRather than trying to overturn regulations outright, Pruitt could simply choose not to enforce rules he doesn't like, or to slow down their enforcement. That strategy would almost certainly face pushback from congressional Democrats, but they're in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives. And lawsuits from environmental groups could take years to resolve.\n\nEven if the courts were to force Pruitt's hand on climate regulations eventually, the lost years could be costly.\n\nAt the Paris climate summit last year, the United States and nearly 200 other nations agreed to limit global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which many scientists see as a dangerous tipping point. The countries also set an aspirational goal of 1.5 degrees, which scientists consider safer. Already, just 1 degree of warming has brought deadly consequences.\n\n\"Before the election, we were on the precipice of no longer being able to achieve those targets,\" said Gerrard, the Columbia University climate law expert. \"(Pruitt's) selections stalls the momentum, and makes much lower the already slim chance of achieving a temperature in the 1.5- to 2-degree range.\"\n\nEven with Pruitt in charge of the EPA, Trump won't be able to make good on his promise to revive the coal industry and put coal miners back to work, energy experts say. That's because the main cause of coal's demise hasn't been the Obama administration's climate regulations, but rather the low cost of natural gas, which is out-competing coal in the electricity marketplace.\n\nSimilarly, many energy experts say the transition from fossil fuels to climate-friendly energy is irreversible, pointing to the rapidly falling costs of solar and wind power and the growth of electric cars and other clean-energy technologies. Solar and wind accounted for two-thirds of new electricity capacity in the United States last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nBut time isn't on the climate's side.\n\nRenewable energy is growing, and climate pollution is falling, but those trends aren't happening fast enough. Even before Trump was elected, the United States wasn't on track to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets it submitted at the Paris climate summit, several studies have found. And even if every country were to meet its Paris commitments, studies show global warming would still far exceed 2 degrees Celsius, meaning stricter targets and faster action is needed.\n\nIn a way, Trump's choice of Pruitt isn't surprising: The president-elect pledged during the campaign to dismantle or severely diminish the size and scope of the EPA.\n\n\"Picking an adversary of the EPA as the EPA’s head is a 'burn down the house' kind of moment, which is consistent with Trump’s campaign,\" Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said in an email. \"It looks like Trump’s going to try to do what he said he was going to try to do.\"\n\nStill, taking apart the EPA could be harder than Trump made it sound during the campaign. Even if Congress slashes its budget, the agency is still obligated to administer the country's foundational environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. It's not clear if there's an appetite among congressional Republicans to gut those popular statutes.\n\nWhitman, who ran the EPA under the second President Bush, is hopeful reality will kick in for Pruitt once he takes office. She noted that he's lost most of his lawsuits against the agency, \"so certainly he understands that some things are required by law to protect public health and the environment.\"\n\n\"Things often look different when you’re in office,\" Whitman said. \"So hopefully he'll take a deep breath and see what he can do to provide the protections that EPA is supposed to provide.\"\n\nContributing: John C.

Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.\n\nIn the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\n\n“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”\n\nIQAir\n\nAbove: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.\n\nIt’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nPM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nMillions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.\n\nIQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.\n\nIn the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.\n\n“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.\n\nResearchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”\n\nClimate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.\n\nChina — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.\n\nThe report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.\n\n“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.\n\nThe report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.\n\n“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.\n\nHammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.\n\nTarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\n\n“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.\n\nHammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\n\n“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy.

Net zero means cutting greenhouse gas emissions as close to zero as possible.\n\nHere’s why the world is moving away from fossil fuels:\n\nWhy are fossil fuels bad?\n\nWhen fossil fuels are burned to produce energy for electricity, heat and transportation, they release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nThis increased heat causes the surface temperature of the Earth to rise, which gives way to extreme weather, biodiversity loss, worsened health and rising sea levels, to give a few examples.\n\nNearly three-fourths of human-caused emissions over the past two decades came from burning fossil fuels, the Department of Energy reports.\n\nBurning fossil fuels also emits harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides and soot, which can cause health problems like asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer.\n\nTaking an 'aggressive' step:Hawaii is closing its only coal power plant\n\nClimate change's impact on children:Black and Hispanic children suffer more from asthma\n\nWhat are fossil fuels?\n\nFossil fuels are extracted from decomposed plant and animal matter. This fossilized material turns into coal, oil and natural gas. According to National Geographic, coal is found in sedimentary rock deposits, oil comes from a solid material between layers of sedimentary rock and natural gas is found in pockets above oil deposits.\n\nThese fossil fuels contain carbon and hydrogen and, when burned, release energy that is used to light up the world with electricity, heat homes and businesses, fuel industrial processes and power vehicles.\n\nFossil fuels are a nonrenewable resource because they formed during the Prehistoric Period.\n\nWhy do we still use fossil fuel?\n\nFossil fuels produce cheap and reliable energy. They supply about 80% of the world’s energy, the Environmental Energy Study Institute reports. Almost half of the U.S.’ energy-related CO2 emissions come from oil, with 36% coming from natural gas and another 19% from coal.\n\nFossil fuels came into widespread use in the industrial era, and not having to rely on burning biomass for energy allowed for innovation. Oil became the most popular energy source because it was efficient in powering the transportation industry. Fossil fuels have a greater energy density, which means a smaller volume of them are needed to get the job done, the Brookings Institution reports.\n\nFossil fuels are known for their reliability because they're not dependent on certain weather conditions to be burned. They’ve been heavily subsidized by the government because of how ingrained they are in global energy practices, so they remain at a low cost, according to SolarReviews.\n\nWhat would happen if we stopped using fossil fuels?\n\nAccording to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere for anywhere between 300 to 1,000 years.\n\nMoving away from the fossil fuel industry would mean shifting to renewable energy like solar, wind, ocean and geothermal energy, as well as hydropower. Renewable energy comes from natural sources and is constantly replenished.\n\nStill, ending the use of fossil fuels use will not remove the CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions already in our atmosphere.\n\nCarbon removal was introduced as one method to combat this – it's a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in trees, plants, soil, rocks or the ocean. According to the World Resource Institute, using a combination of natural strategies and high-tech strategies \"would provide the most cumulative carbon removal at the lowest risk.\" This could be tree restoration, soil management, direct air capture, mineralization, ocean-based carbon removal, enhanced root crops or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.\n\n\"Even with rapid investment in emission reductions, the United States could need to remove about 2 gigatons of CO2 per year by midcentury to reach net-zero — that's about 30% of U.S. 2019 greenhouse gas emissions,\" WRI writes.\n\nNew UN report:World is 'heading in the wrong direction' on climate change\n\nWhat is storm surge?:Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nDig deeper", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2016/10/13/voter-guide-clinton-and-trump-global-warming-energy-and-california-drought/91277414/", "title": "Voter guide: Clinton and Trump on global warming, energy and the ...", "text": "Sammy Roth\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump disagree on just about everything. But the gap between the presidential candidates might be widest on an issue getting relatively little attention: the environment.\n\nClinton has promised to fight climate change by promoting renewable energy, including solar and wind; Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax,\" which is false, and promised to increase production of coal, oil and gas, the fossil fuels primarily responsible for heating the planet. Clinton has outlined several proposals to boost water supplies in the West, while Trump has incorrectly suggested \"there is no drought\" in California and blamed government regulations for water shortages afflicting farmers. He has also indicated he'd abolish the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe next president will take office at a critical moment. Climate change is already bringing record temperatures, rising seas and more extreme droughts, floods and wildfires. The United States is rapidly transitioning from coal to cleaner sources of energy. Much of the West continues to suffer from drought — including California, the country's breadbasket and most populous state.\n\nJump to: Climate | Jump to: Energy | Jump to: Water\n\nScientists and climate advocates have praised Clinton's platform as an ambitious starting point for fighting climate change, although they acknowledge it's just a starting point. And while politically conservative environmentalists wish Clinton would focus on market-based solutions rather than government regulations, many of them prefer her proposals to Trump's fact-defying climate denial.\n\n\"There's very little to like in his environmental platform, as far as I’m concerned,\" said former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who ran the EPA for two years under President George W. Bush. \"To say you want to do away with the agency ... You can say it's overreached at times, sure. But to say you're going to try to get rid of the agency, I think, is counter to all the things the American people want,\" like clean air and clean water.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Subscribe to The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nGET TICKETS: Southern California Energy + Water Summit, Oct. 26-27\n\nTrump has called global warming a \"hoax\" and \"bulls***,\" even though nearly all publishing climate scientists say humans are heating the planet. He once tweeted that global warming \"was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,\" although he later said he was joking. Earlier this year, he said he's \"not a big believer in man-made climate change.\"\n\nRELATED: How global warming is harming human health, the economy and national security\n\nClimate scientists hardly know how to respond. They point to the many ways global warming is already taking a toll on humanity, from the intensification of large fires in the West, to regular flooding in South Florida and other low-lying areas, to the spread of diseases like dengue fever outside their old geographic comfort zones. July marked the 15th straight month of record global temperatures.\n\n\"We have known since the 1850s that our fossil fuel use is putting heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, wrapping an extra blanket around our planet that is causing it to heat up,\" said Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. \"The time for the debate over whether this is real, or whether humans are responsible, was literally 200 years ago.\"\n\nTrump has promised to \"cancel\" the international climate deal struck in Paris last year, when 195 countries agreed to limit the average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, long seen as a dangerous tipping point. Trump would also eliminate Obama's Clean Power Plan, a regulation designed to shift electricity generation from coal to cleaner energy sources.\n\nMichael Gerrard, who leads Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it wouldn't be difficult for Trump to accomplish those goals.\n\nWhile it would take several years to replace the Clean Power Plan with a less stringent regulation, Trump could simply direct the Environmental Protection Agency not to enforce it, Gerrard said. The Paris climate deal meanwhile, is largely non-binding. So if Trump decides the United States won't live up to its commitments, there's little the rest of the world could do to force America to comply.\n\n\"As it stands today, the odds are not great that we will stay under 2 degrees. If Trump becomes president and carries through on his promises, all hope is pretty much lost,\" Gerrard said.\n\nLOSING SNOW: What global warming means for water supplies\n\nIf the United States reneges on its Paris commitments, experts say, the global climate deal could fall apart, with major polluters like China and India deciding they shouldn't have to live up to their promises if America's going to keep burning fossil fuels indiscriminately. That would extinguish any hope of keeping climate change to manageable levels, locking in a future of dangerous warming.\n\nThe possibility is so alarming to some scientists that 375 members of the National Academy of Sciences published an open letter last month slamming Trump for his statements on climate. Those scientists — including renowned physicist Stephen Hawking — warned of \"severe and long-lasting\" consequences, for the United States and the world, if Trump backs out of the Paris agreement.\n\n\"It would severely damage our credibility in the international arena, and that would also handicap future attempts to deal with the problem,\" said Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped organize the letter. \"It would send a message to the rest of the world that the U.S. can turn its back on its agreements at any time.\"\n\nAsked to consider the consequences of a Trump presidency, water and climate researcher Peter Gleick — who co-founded the Pacific Institute think tank — said he \"can't bear to think of it.\"\n\n\"Trump’s few statements on climate indicate he poses a dangerous and potentially catastrophic risk of plunging the world into deep climate chaos,\" Gleick said in an email.\n\nTrump has shifted many of his policy positions over the course of the campaign. But he's been steadfast in his aggressive support for fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.\n\nDuring an energy speech in Pittsburgh last month, Trump said the United States is \"sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy — some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.\" He promised to \"lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities.\"\n\n\"It’s all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages and lower energy prices,\" he said.\n\nExperts say Trump's promises reflect a poor understanding of the market forces that shape energy development, and of government's power to shape those forces. For instance, Trump has pledged to revive the shrinking coal-mining industry while simultaneously increasing natural gas production. That would be impossible, energy experts say, because coal and natural gas are direct competitors in the electricity market. The sudden availability of cheap natural gas, fueled by the U.S. fracking boom, has arguably been the biggest cause of coal's struggles over the last few years.\n\nDuring an energy speech in North Dakota earlier this year, Trump said opening more federal land to fossil fuel production would increase economic activity by $20 trillion over the next four decades and boost wages by more than $30 billion annually over the next seven years. But those numbers — which come from a study released by the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank funded in part by the fossil fuel industry — are far from realistic, according to Kelly Sanders, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in energy and water.\n\nThe institute's study assumes high prices for oil and natural gas: $5.64 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas $100 per barrel of oil, even though though the most current data shows natural gas at less than $3 and oil at about $50. If Trump opens more land to fossil fuel development, as he's promised to do, those prices would likely go down rather than up, Sanders said.\n\n\"Trump will say anything that will sound good to the people that he's talking to, but typically these assertions can't be backed up,\" she said.\n\nTrump's public comments on solar and wind power have been mostly negative.\n\nDuring his first debate against Clinton last month, Trump criticized the federal government for giving a $535 guaranteed loan to Solyndra, a California solar-panel manufacturer that subsequently went bankrupt. He used that example to characterize the government's foray into solar energy a \"disaster.\" The federal Department of Energy, however, expects the clean-energy loan program that funded Solyndra to turn a profit for taxpayers, because most companies that got money have succeeded and are paying off their loans with interest.\n\nTrump has also bashed wind turbines, describing them as ugly, eagle-killing machines that don't produce reliable energy. He's had especially harsh words for the wind farm in the San Gorgonio Pass outside Palm Springs, tweeting that the city \"has been destroyed — absolutely destroyed — by the world's ugliest wind farm at the Gateway on Interstate 10. Very very sad!\"\n\nAs president, experts say, Trump could only do so much to slow the growth of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper all the time. Wind is already cost-competitive with fossil fuels in some regions, and solar is getting closer, thanks in part to cost reductions spurred by government investment. But Trump could limit clean energy development on public lands and waters, while opening vast new areas to coal mining and oil and gas drilling. He could also roll back planned increases to federal fuel-efficiency standards for cars, making it more difficult for America to wean itself off oil.\n\n\"On the transportation side, he could do a lot of damage,\" said Ann Carlson, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nClinton has put renewable energy at the center of her environmental platform. She's called for a tenfold increase in clean energy production on public lands and waters by 2027, and a $60 billion incentive program to encourage states and local governments to shift to clean energy. She'd like to see half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of her first term, and she's set a goal of cutting U.S. climate pollution 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. Currently, annual emissions are just 9 percent below 2005 levels, according to the most recent EPA data.\n\nClinton has also taken a harder line against fossil fuels this year, prompted by Sen. Bernie Sanders' Democratic primary challenge. As secretary of state, Clinton said the Obama administration was \"inclined\" to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, before opposing Keystone as a candidate. She also plans to \"begin phasing down fossil fuel production on federal lands,\" a campaign spokesperson told The Desert Sun earlier this year, when asked for her position on the growing \"keep it in the ground\" movement. Clinton has set a goal of reducing American oil consumption by a third by 2027.\n\nGerrard, the Columbia University climate law expert, described Clinton's goals as \"bold but achievable\" — a position echoed by several energy and climate experts interviewed for this article. The big question is whether she'll able to achieve those goals, with Republicans expected to control the House of Representatives for the foreseeable future.\n\nClinton could follow in Obama's footsteps by using her executive authority to support clean energy, experts say. In addition to permitting more solar and wind projects on public land, she could ratchet up vehicle fuel-efficiency standards and possibly use the Clean Air Act to implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program, a proposal that would surely spark lawsuits. Clinton has also pledged to continue Obama's Clean Power Plan — assuming it withstands an ongoing legal challenge, expected to reach the Supreme Court.\n\n\"She is working with trends that are already occurring in the electricity sector, and that helps. And the price of solar panels has dropped dramatically,\" said Carlson, the UCLA climate law expert. \"So she can do some of this. But one of the really hard things to do is get us on a pathway to 80 percent reductions by 2050, as opposed to more moderate reductions over the next 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nClinton's 80-percent goal is roughly in line with what the U.S. would need to do to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. But scientists caution the 2-degree target is somewhat arbitrary. People are already suffering from just 1 degree of warming, and the problems will get worse as more heat-trapping carbon dioxide makes its way into the atmosphere.\n\n\"The best analogy for me is to look at smoking. The more cigarettes we smoke, the higher our risk,\" said Hayhoe, the Texas Tech climatologist. \"The sooner we quit smoking, the better off we'll be.\"\n\nWith that reality in mind, some environmental activists have slammed Clinton's proposals as inadequate, criticizing her for not supporting a tax on climate pollution and a full ban on fossil fuel drilling on federal land. Those critics have also pointed to her history of support for natural gas and fracking, the controversial technology that's fueled a sharp increase in American oil and gas production. As secretary of state, Clinton aggressively promoted fracking overseas, urging governments to allow U.S. firms to drill for natural gas, even in the face of intense public opposition in some countries.\n\nNatural gas produces less climate pollution when burned than coal and oil do. But it's still a fossil fuel, and studies have increasingly shown that too much gas is incompatible with global climate goals. Clinton has described gas as a \"bridge\" that could help the U.S. transition from coal to solar and wind, although she said earlier this year we need to cross the bridge \"quickly.\"\n\n\"We really don’t have a lot of room for gas,\" said Sanders, the USC energy and water specialist. \"There are a lot of scientists who basically say we need to stop emitting carbon dioxide yesterday.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The new climate rallying cry: keep it in the ground\n\nSome climate advocates have criticized Clinton for not being more supportive of nuclear power, which is controversial among environmentalists but still a zero-carbon energy source. In a carefully worded statement earlier this year, Clinton said she supports \"safe and responsible\" nuclear energy and opposes efforts to \"rapidly shut down our nation's nuclear power fleet.\"\n\n\"If you forget about the politics for a minute and look at what’s technically necessary to solve this problem, nuclear has to be part of the mix,\" said Emanuel, the MIT atmospheric scientist who helped organize the open letter criticizing Trump. \"It doesn't add up mathematically to suggest we can do it all with renewables.\"\n\nNeither Clinton nor Trump has made water a campaign focus, even as drought has gripped the West. But to the extent they have talked about water, their approaches couldn't be more different.\n\nClinton's conservation platform calls water \"the lifeblood of the West,\" noting the Colorado River Basin has endured 16 straight years of drought. To help state and local governments ensure sustainable water supplies for the future, Clinton says she would direct more federal funding to programs and technologies that lower consumption or create new water sources, including wastewater recycling, stormwater capture, groundwater recharge and infrastructure modernization. She says she'd triple spending on the Bureau of Reclamation's main water conservation grant program.\n\nClinton would also work to establish a national Water Innovation Lab, which her platform says would \"bring urban water managers, farmers and tribes together with engineers, entrepreneurs, conservationists and other stakeholders,\" in an effort to develop innovative technologies and strategies for limiting water use, creating new supplies and restoring natural ecosystems.\n\nGleick, the water scientist who co-founded the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, said Clinton's proposals are \"far more than lip service.\"\n\n\"They reflect thoughtful assessment of both water problems and the most effective solutions,\" he said in an email. \"They point to the most important approaches that offer cost-effective ways of both expanding supplies (wastewater treatment and reuse and capturing more stormwater) and reducing wasteful demands (through improvements in efficiency).\"\n\nRELATED: Climate change raises risk of megadroughts in the Southwest\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has expressed support for the Central Valley farmers who are furious state and federal officials won't let them take more water from California's rivers and streams.\n\nIt's one of California's fiercest political battles: Wildlife authorities are required by law to leave enough water in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems to protect endangered fish like Chinook salmon and the Delta smelt. Between prolonged drought and continued fish declines, less water has been flowing to farmers, who have compensated by pumping groundwater at unsustainable rates.\n\nEnvironmentalists have criticized wildlife officials for not leaving more water in the rivers, saying they're not doing enough to keep certain species from going extinct. The agriculture industry, though, has railed against what it sees as ineffective regulations that needlessly allow water to flow out to sea. After meeting with farmers in Northern California earlier this year, Trump took their side.\n\n\"If I win, believe me, we're going to start opening up the water, so that you can have your farmers survive, so that your job market will get better,\" he said during a speech in Fresno. He added that farmers had told him \"there is no drought,\" even though the U.S. Drought Monitor categorized 86 percent of the state as experiencing drought conditions at the time.\n\nGleick called Trump's drought comments a \"dog whistle\" to his Fresno audience, meant to communicate that \"the water shortages you’re experiencing are not natural but due to the forces against us: Democrats, city-dwellers, environmentalists, bureaucrats in Washington and Sacramento.\"\n\nFor Paul Wenger, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation, Trump's promise to \"start opening up the water\" was a sign the Republican nominee \"seems to understand the inflexibility of some of the regulations we’re dealing with.\" But Wenger was as confused as anyone by Trump's suggestion that \"there is no drought.\" And he criticized the candidate for a lack of specific proposals.\n\nThat doesn't mean Clinton is better, Wenger added. He said the Democratic nominee's plans to boost water recycling make sense, but \"you can only recycle water that you have.\"\n\n\"On our issues, I don't see a lot of difference between either one of them,\" Wenger said. \"We're just hoping that whoever gets elected, they'll work with us.\"\n\nSammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

By Sept. 20 it had already forced the evacuation and relocation of over 5,000 residents.\n\nAs the latest developments are shared online, many social media users are also sharing a longtime theory that the eruption could cause a tsunami that would reach the East Coast of the United States.\n\n\"The things I've read they are expecting it to erupt and a piece of land would slide into the ocean and it would cause a tsunami for the USA east coast!\" the post says. \"They have been predicting this for years.\"\n\nThe accompanying image is a map of the eastern part of the United States. Text laid over it claims that a \"50 meter tsunami after Canary Island volcano eruption and landslide puts THIS under water.\" Florida, New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, and parts of southern Texas and Louisiana are among the areas that would be purportedly affected by the tsunami, according to the image.\n\nThe image has spread widely on social media. Another version, posted on Facebook on Sept. 19, accrued more than 800 shares in two days before it was deleted.\n\nNick Knowles, an English television presenter, also shared a version of the claim on Twitter, where he has almost 160,000 followers.\n\nWhile the theory being shared exists, social media users are presenting it as if it is a likely scenario or represents an expert consensus of some kind.\n\nIn reality, it's a hypothesis that both American and Spanish officials have debunked, saying the conditions required for a tsunami big enough to submerge part of the country's coasts are extremely unlikely to happen.\n\nMore:Volcano erupts on Spanish island La Palma forcing thousands of evacuations\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the users who shared the image for comment.\n\nVolcanic eruption not big enough to create tsunami\n\nAs of Sept. 21, two days after the initial spew of lava, the Cumbre Vieja volcanic eruption had covered around 254 acres and destroyed 166 buildings, according to the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute, which has been sharing news and analysis on the eruption.\n\nThe chances of acid rain and toxic clouds remain low, though the volcanic ash in the air could pose a risk to residents of the island.\n\nAnd there's a vastly lower chance of a landslide causing a tsunami big enough to reach the coast of the United States.\n\nFact check: Moon landing conspiracy theory misrepresents lunar footprint\n\nThe theory has been around since 2001, when two college professors – Steven Ward from University of California, Santa Cruz and Simon Day from University College in London – published a study about the possibility of a tsunami originating in the Canary Islands later reaching American coasts and other parts of the world.\n\nThe four-page paper said that \"during a future\" eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, a landslide of between 150 and 500 cubic kilometers, which could trigger a tsunami with waves between 10 and 25 meters high hitting North America around nine hours after the hypothesized volcanic eruption.\n\nSpanish and American officials have pushed back on the theory, however.\n\nAfter announcing the eruption on Twitter on Sept. 19, the U.S. Geological Survey said the tsunami threat remained local, debunking users' claims that a purported \"mega-tsunami\" would happen.\n\nThat same day, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center posted on Facebook that the eruption did not pose any tsunami risks to the East Coast.\n\nThe islands' volcanology institute has assured that extreme conditions would have to occur for the theory to become a reality.\n\nFor instance, the volcano would have to grow by 1,000 meters over its current height, which the institute told Spanish national TV station Antena 3 would take another 40,000 years.\n\nFact check:Police confirm Brian Laundrie lookalike in viral trail cam photo isn't him\n\nAnother way a \"mega-tsunami\" could occur is if an earthquake of \"exceptionally high magnitude\" and a high magnitude volcanic eruption were to take place at the same time. Those two phenomena together could lead to a landslide of the Cumbre Vieja flank, which is what Ward and Day's theory hypothesized.\n\nNone of these conditions have occurred, however.\n\n'Mega-tsunami' theory resurfaces with seismic activity in La Palma's\n\nThe \"mega-tsunami\" theory often resurfaces with news of a volcanic eruption or seismic activity in the Canary Islands.\n\nIn 2016, the Daily Star, categorized by Media Bias Fact Check as a \"questionable source\" of news based on its \"routine publication of conspiracy theories,\" published an article on the theory. In response, geographer and earth scientist Dave Petley debunked the theory on his blog, \"The Landslide Blog.\"\n\nPetley, whose research at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom focuses on landslides , said no previous volcanic flank collapse in the world has led to a tsunami of the magnitude Day and Ward describe. Additionally, he wrote, submarine deposits from volcanic flank collapses suggest they don't happen as one big collapse, like Day and Ward hypothesize.\n\nRather, they happen in a series of slides, which would make the resulting tsunami \"much less significant.\"\n\n\"It really is time that this event was presented for what it is, which is an absolutely extreme scenario based on a very highly unlikely combination of events that is without precedent,\" Petley wrote.\n\nFact check: False claim that many California voters were told they already voted\n\nWhile the last volcanic eruption in La Palma happened 30 years before Ward and Day's study was published in 2001, the island is of volcanic nature, and seismic activity is often considered normal.\n\nIn the last two decades, there has been extensive seismic activity similar to the small earthquakes seen prior to the eruption, according to Spain's National Geographic Institute. This activity was within normal parameters for the area and didn't \"present any risks to the residents.\" Many of the earthquakes registered aren't even felt by residents, as they happen kilometers under the surface.\n\nFact check:Photo of HHS official Rachel Levine in a bathing suit is altered\n\nIn October 2017, after more than 100 seismic events were registered within one week in La Palma, the islands' volcanology institute debunked the theory – again.\n\n\"Although it's been more than 10 years since this theory, the hypothesis that gave way (to the idea) of a collapse of the Cumbre Vieja is still being considered,\" the institute said, according to the Spanish online newspaper El Diario.\n\nThe institute said the probability of a highly explosive eruption happening at the same time as a large earthquake – which is required for the theory to be true – is \"extremely remote, according to geological records of this type of event on the island.\"\n\n\"The Cumbre Vieja is stable even under the effects of eruptions similar to those that have occurred in the last tens of thousands of years,\" it said.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that experts have predicted the eruption in La Palma will cause a tsunami that would reach the U.S. Spanish and American officials have said the volcanic eruption doesn't present any risks to the United States.

Human habitation may be partly to blame", "text": "Officials are unsure what started the ongoing blazes in Maui that have killed six people, forced hundreds of evacuations, torched structures, left thousands without power and prompted some locals to bolt into the ocean to escape marauding flames. But some experts said they suspect human development on the island is at least partly to blame for the destruction.\n\nWildfires have quadrupled in Hawaii in recent decades, and many scientists say the culprit is unmanaged, nonnative grasslands planted by plantations and ranchers and others unfamiliar with the island's native ecosystems. The grass is dry and prone to fires.\n\n“There is no doubt that fire-prone grasses have invaded drier Hawaiian ecosystems and brought larger, more intense fires,” said Peter Vitousek, a professor of earth sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nWhat caused the Maui fires?\n\nHigh winds and low humidity likely contributed to the fires, but officials know little else, said Maj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, at a briefing Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't know what actually ignited the fires, but we were made aware in advance by the National Weather Service that we were in a red flag situation — so that's dry conditions for a long time, so the fuel, the trees and everything, was dry,\" he said, according to CBS News.\n\nHurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, fueled the strong winds overnight in Maui, with gusts of 60 miles per hour damaging homes and knocking out power.\n\nState officials activated the Hawaii National Guard to assist police in Maui, where the areas most impacted include Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui; Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous Upcounty region; and Kihei, a mix of homes, condos, short-term vacation rentals and visitor facilities in South Maui.\n\nWildfires were uncommon before humans arrives in Hawaii\n\nAside from areas with active volcanoes, wildfires were uncommon in the Hawaiian islands prior to the arrival of humans, said David Beilman, a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This more recent era in Earth's history, in which human activity has impacted climate and ecosystems, is unofficially referred to as the Anthropocene Epoch.\n\n\"On the other islands with less volcanic activity, fires did occur, but very, very rarely,\" Beilman said. \"This Maui situation is an Anthropocene phenomenon.\"\n\nKaniela Ing, national director for the Green New Deal Network and an Indigenous leader in Hawaii, said the wildfires offer further proof of a dangerous climate emergency.\n\n“We need legislation that is as bold and urgent as the scale of the wildfires choking Hawaii and Canada, the heatwaves suffocating Texas, and the extreme flooding drowning Europe,” said Ing, a former state legislator in Hawaii. “How many more lives lost or families displaced in communities like mine is President Biden willing to tolerate before he declares a climate emergency and activates politicians to take further climate action?”\n\nHistoric church destroyed:Minister vows to rebuild 200-year-old Waiola Church: 'Strength lies in our people'\n\nIs tourism to blame?\n\nThe fires come amid an ongoing debate about whether tourism is harming Hawaii's ecosystems.\n\nEarlier this year, Fodor's Travel named Maui among 10 destinations on its 2023 “No List” that tourists should reconsider visiting because of the threat of environmental damage caused by overtourism and climate change.\n\nClay Trauernicht, a professor of natural resources and environmental management at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said it would be misleading to simply blame weather and climate for the blazes.\n\nInstead, Trauernicht, who noted in 2018 that the area burned annually by wildland fire in Hawaii has quadrupled in recent decades, pointed to unmanaged, nonnative grasslands that have flourished in Hawaii after decades of declining agriculture.\n\n“These savannas now cover about a million acres across the main Hawaiian islands, mostly the legacy of land clearing for plantation agriculture and ranching in the late 1800s/early 1900s,” he wrote in a series of posts on the social platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhat's a solution to lessen wildfires in Hawaii?\n\nThe transformation to savannas makes the land much more susceptible to the hot, dry and windy conditions that produce such wildfires, Trauernicht said, with much more buildup of fire fuels during rainy periods. Agricultural declines, meanwhile, also make firefighting more difficult as roads become unmaintained, irrigation and water storage lessen and those familiar with the land move away.\n\n“The burden Hawaii’s current fire problem places on emergency responders, the impacts on farms and ecosystems, the losses our community’s experiencing right now – it’s mostly from benign neglect,” he wrote.\n\nWhile maddening, the situation also offers a glimmer of hope, Trauernicht said.\n\n“Hawaii’s fire problem could be far, far more manageable with adequate support, planning and resources for fuel reduction projects, agricultural land use and restoration and reforestation around communities and the foot of our forests,” he wrote.\n\nHawaii Wildfire Management Organization, a non-profit based in Waimea on Hawaii Island, said the increasing fires are threatening humans, infrastructure, water quality, agricultural production and natural resources.\n\n\"Hawaii has a wildfire problem,\" the organization states on its website. \"Each year, about 0.5% of Hawaii's total land area burns each year, equal to or greater than the proportion burned of any other US state. Over 98% of wildfires are human-caused. Human ignitions coupled with an increasing amount of nonnative, fire-prone grasses and shrubs and a warming, drying climate have greatly increased the wildfire problem.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/09/maui-hawaii-wildfire-live-updates/70556894007/", "title": "Hawaii wildfire updates: 36 dead and over 270 structures damaged", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Wednesday, Aug. 9. For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire and the ongoing evacuations, check out our live updates file for Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\nMAUI, Hawaii − Wind-whipped wildfires in Hawaii forced hundreds of evacuations Wednesday, overwhelmed hospitals and even sent some residents fleeing into the ocean to escape the flames as parts of the popular tourist destination turned into a raging inferno in a matter of hours.\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening. Officials said earlier that 271 structures were damaged or destroyed and dozens of people injured.\n\nEntire blocks of homes and businesses went up in smoke in historic Lahaina Town in Maui, where blazes fueled by wind from a passing hurricane were concentrated. In addition, three wildfires were burning on the Big Island, though two of them were at least 60% contained.\n\nActing Gov. Sylvia Luke said residents had been preparing for Hurricane Dora, which skirted south of the islands, and had no reason to expect the quickly developing blazes.\n\n“We expect rain, sometimes we expect floods,'' she said. \"We never anticipated in this date that a hurricane which did not make impact on our islands would cause these type of wildfires.''\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement he has ordered “all available Federal assets” to help combat the wildfires, including Black Hawk helicopters provided by the Marines.\n\nCounty of Maui spokesperson Mahina Martin told USA TODAY the fires are affecting two areas of the island: Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui, and Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous upcountry region.\n\nOfficials said 2,000 travelers sheltered at Maui's Kahului Airport, and another 4,000 visitors wanted to leave the island. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLocals and visitors scrambled to get information and reach loved ones amid power blackouts and downed cellular and 911 service as well as phone lines in different parts of the islands.\n\nTiare Lawrence, who grew up in Lahaina, was trying to get in touch with her siblings while providing refuge at her home for 14 cousins and uncles who fled the heat, smoke and flames in Lahaina.\n\n“It was apocalyptic from what they explained,” she said.\n\nMaui county officials said multiple structures have burned and multiple evacuation orders are in place as emergency crews battle brush and structure fires. \"It's been an unprecedented incident striking large areas of our island, and it has been pretty much all hands on deck,\" Martin said.\n\nTourists turning around and leaving right after arriving\n\nThe sky over west Maui is hazy with smoke from the devastating wildfires still burning on the island, which continue to displace thousands.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, traffic was at a complete standstill on Honoapiilani Highway, the main road to access Lahaina, as it remains closed. Cars packed with people are parked along the side of the road waiting to return to their hotels or homes, but no time or date has been given yet.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 4,000 people − including residents and tourists from two hotels − evacuated to emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross. On Wednesday, the organization said it was flying in additional volunteers and staff from the mainland to assist with the aftermath of the fires and get people safely to Oahu.Tourists arriving at Kahului Airport are turning around and trying to leave Maui. Alexis and Hector Palomar had their trip planned since May and landed on Wednesday morning.\n\n“We didn’t realize it was happening until we were on our way to the airport. We didn’t think it was that bad until we got here,” Hector Palomar said.\n\nThey immediately changed plans and booked a flight to Kauai, departing just three hours after they arrived on Maui.“Thankfully we’re able to get out,” he said. “I just don’t want to take resources from the locals since it’s an island.”\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'Everything is gone': Resident feels lucky, mournful after Lahaina escape\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay knew how fortunate he and his family were to escape the flames around them alive, having merely lost items that could be replaced.\n\nSaribay had seen homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them,’’ debris turn into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas trying to flee while carrying their prized possessions.\n\n“Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,’’ Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.’’\n\nAnd much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey of trying to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat that caused another car to explode, injuring a woman inside it.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina on his rear-view mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. “Just praying that a miracle happens,’’ he said.\n\n− Ashley Lewis\n\nGovernor has contacted White House, says 'loss of life is expected'\n\nGov. Josh Green said in a statement Wednesday that he expects to request a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the White House in the next 36 to 48 hours once officials have a better understanding of the scope of the damage.\n\nGreen was planning to be out of state for personal travel until next week but is expected to return Wednesday night to address the crisis. He said while the \"heroic efforts\" of first responders have prevented many causalities, \"some loss of life is expected.\"\n\n“Our state appreciates the incredible outpouring of concern and prayers from the mainland. We won’t forget the aloha you have already begun to share with us,” Green said.\n\nLifelong Maui resident had 'never seen anything like this'\n\nKyle Ellison, born and raised in Maui, returned to his Kula home Wednesday morning and started stomping out flames on the property.\n\nThe previous morning, he heard trees fall down into the gulch behind his house and, when a popping sound went off, he figured it was coming from an electrical transformer.\n\n\"A minute later, I ask my wife if the internet is out and if she can smell smoke.\" Ellison said. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this. I have friends in Lahaina who have lost everything.\"\n\nEllison and his family made it out with one truck full of belongings. Their house is still standing but their neighbors' is not. His wife and children went to the houses of three different friends to stay the night but kept having to move as evacuations spread.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of people hurting,'' he said. \"We already have a housing crisis out here and we lost so many more homes.''\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHawaii National Guard activated\n\nLuke and Bissen have issued emergency proclamations in response to the fire. The Hawaii National Guard has been activated and is assisting the Maui Police Department at traffic control points, according to the Hawaii adjutant general.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Hurricane Dora, which was passing 500 miles south of the island chain, and a very strong high pressure north of the state produced powerful, damaging winds through the overnight hours.\n\n\"Very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\" the weather service said in a red flag warning for leeward areas issued Wednesday.\n\n'Chaos' trying to find shelter as people left with few possessions\n\nPeople in Lahaina described frantically trying to get to relative safety in one of the nearby emergency shelters. But they weren’t told by anyone where to go – just that they had to leave.\n\nThroughout the night, people were driving aimlessly and following other cars, just trying to head north, as police and firefighters dealt with growing flames.\n\nThe War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku opened to evacuees this morning. There is no capacity limit to how many people can stay there. The community has set up cots and are giving away clothing, food and pillows to evacuees. A medical team is checking for burns and smoke inhalation, and to aid anyone with existing conditions without access to medication.\n\nMauro Farinelli and his wife Judit arrived at the shelter around noon. They have lived right on Front Street in Lahaina for four years and described their evacuation as “chaos.”\n\n“No one told us we had to leave, it was getting bad and we had to leave with the clothes on our back,” he said. The couple went to the boat ramp where they were told they could jump into the ocean “if things got bad.” Farinelli said he can’t return home until the electric wires are assessed in Lahaina.\n\n“Nobody thinks it can happen to them,” he said. “Where I lived, it was like there’s no way a fire can get here because I’m not close to vegetation but the wind was so strong, it was like a blow torch.\"\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'We just lost a large part of our heritage,' official says\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran cited various landmarks that have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and buildings, temples and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui. Lahaina, where the largest fires are concentrated, was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nBrush and wildfires are not unheard of in Hawaii’s leeward regions during the dry season. In 2018, Maui suffered a massive brush fire on the same side of the island, primarily on the slopes. “This is so much worse,” Keith-Agaran said, pointing to the scope of the current blaze.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, you’re not going to be ready for something that moves as quickly and as big as this,” he said. “I don’t think we had enough equipment or people to be fighting fires upcountry, small fires in central Maui and then this huge fire on the west side.”\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nBurn victims sent to other islands\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey, who was not aware of any deaths.\n\nLuke told CNN Maui's hospitals are overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation and it's been difficult to transport people needing care to other facilities.\n\n“We are already in communication with other hospital systems about relieving the burden – the reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment,” Luke said. “In addition to dealing with disaster, we're dealing with major transportation issues as well.”\n\nResident of nearby island searching for family in Maui\n\nLeomana Turalde's mother called him on the phone crying Wednesday morning, saying she never went to sleep on Tuesday night in Maui amid the massive fires.\n\nTuralde said he has several “aunties” who live on Maui, two blocks away from Lahaina’s popular Front Street. Wednesday morning, one of the women went missing, he told USA TODAY. It is impossible to get in touch with some people because cellphone infrastructure on Maui burned down, he said.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burnt down to ashes,'' said Turalde, 36, who runs a sunscreen company. \"Most of the families on Maui, if you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you’re still trying to figure out where they are.”\n\nHe said he is boarding a plane on Wednesday to Maui from where he lives on the island of Hawaii to help family members search for missing relatives near their homestead property, which he said burned down.\n\n“I’m going to go to the first place that everybody would go to when they’re in trouble, and that’s the house, even though the house isn’t there,” he said. “Home is usually the first place you should start if people are missing.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nAll roads to historic Lahaina closed as Front Street burns\n\nAll roads into Lahaina, a town of roughly 13,000, and West Maui have been closed to public use, except for emergency services, county officials said Wednesday. Photos shared by the county overnight showed a line of flames blazing across an intersection in Lahaina and flames leaping above buildings in the town, whose historic district is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"Do NOT go to Lahaina town,\" officials warned.\n\nGreen said much of the area \"has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced.\"\n\nFront Street business owner Alan Dickar told CBS News buildings on both sides of the street in the popular tourist area were engulfed in flames. Dickar said it appeared the fire department was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Maui can't handle this,\" Dickar said. \"A lot of people just lost their jobs because a lot of businesses burned. A lot of people lost their homes. ... This is going to be devastating for Maui.\"\n\nLahaina’s historic Waiola Church and the neighboring Lahaina Hongwanji Mission temple were among the structures that caught fire Wednesday, the Maui News reported. The church was established in 1823, and its graveyard, believed to be the first Christian cemetery in Hawaii, is the final resting place for early members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, according to its website.\n\nUncertainty for many residents\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we was going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.” The ocean was black and eerie.\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes. But local residents lose their homes.\n\nShe’s worried about what’s next now that the shelter is gone but she’s thankful for her family’s safety.\n\n“You can lose everything but you cannot replace a life,\" she said.\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui fires map\n\nTrack the latest wildfire and red flag warnings here with data that is updated based on input from several incident and intelligence sources.\n\nNearly 2,000 people stuck at Maui airport\n\nMartin said the Kahului Airport in Maui has more than 2,000 visitors who have either canceled flights or had nowhere to go. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said Wednesday that about 1,800 people sheltered in place overnight in the airport with many highways on the island's west site still closed.\n\n\"HDOT worked with airlines/TSA to shelter passengers for safety's sake as wildfires continue to burn in Lahaina and upcountry,\" officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNearly 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, county officials said.\n\nTen public schools in Maui were closed Wednesday, including one that is being used as an evacuation shelter, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.\n\nStudent boarders at Lahainaluna High School were moved Tuesday evening to Maui High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees to be picked up by family members or emergency contacts, officials said. The Lahainaluna campus remained closed Wednesday because of a lack of power, wind damage and brush fire evacuations.\n\nAs the brush fire spread to Kihei, officials announced Tuesday that four public schools in South Maui would be closed in addition to schools in West, Upcountry and Central Maui.\n\nHomes destroyed; residents evacuated\n\nThe Coast Guard has been responding to areas where residents are \"entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\" county officials said. A Coast Guard boat rescued 12 people from the waters off Lahaina, officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nLawrence told Hawaii News Now people were running for their lives. She said the homes of everyone she knows in Lahaina have been down.\n\n“It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said.\n\nIn Kula, at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres, Bissen told The Associated Press. About 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, he said.\n\nThe Red Cross has opened several emergency shelters for residents. Martin said one evacuation center alone had more than 1,200 people.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain they are very anxious at our evacuation centers,\" she said.\n\nLocal resident could tell something was brewing\n\nAlice Carillo lives about five miles from the fire that erupted in Kula, in a hilly, bucolic region of Maui known as upcountry.\n\nThe 79-year-old woke up in the middle of the night Tuesday to the smell of something burning. She opened the door of her Makawao plantation home, where she’s lived for more than half a century, and “it was like fog out there, so covered with smoke.” She could see a fire above the Kula shopping center.\n\n10 schools closed, including one converted to evacuation shelter\n\nConditions had been especially windy in the days leading up to the blaze, in part because of Hurricane Dora moving south of the island. Carillo could sense something was brewing as the gusts picked up. Now, as she looks out at the mountain, the sky is clear.\n\n“You wouldn’t have even known there was a fire,” she said.\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nWildfire smoke map:See where fires are burning in Hawaii and across the US\n\nThousands without power; 911 service no longer available in West Maui\n\nMore than 14,000 customers in Maui County were without power, according to Poweroutage.us. County officials advised residents to stay at least 30 feet from downed power lines, which at one point restricted travel along parts of Honoapiilani Highway. Part of the highway was reopened Tuesday evening to allow access in and out of Lahaina, but motorists were told to expect traffic to move slowly through the bypass.\n\nIn West Maui, 911 service is no longer available. Martin said it's been \"very difficult\" to manage evacuation orders in Lahaina because the area does not have cell service and only landlines are functioning.\n\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nStrong winds are fueling the flames\n\nIn Kula, winds were recorded at 80 mph, \"which greatly affected the speed and the movement of the fire,\" Martin said.\n\nBecause of the wind gusts, helicopters weren’t able to dump water on the fires from the sky – or gauge more precise fire sizes – and firefighters were encountering roads blocked by downed trees and power lines as they worked the inland fires, Martin previously told the Associated Press.\n\nA high wind warning and red flag warning for dangerous fire weather issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nMaui fire officials warned that erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes and dropping humidity combined with the direction and the location of the fire have made it difficult to predict its path and speed. The wind can also sends fire embers up and ignite sparks downwind, creating fires far from their source, officials said.\n\n“The fire can be a mile or more from your house, but in a minute or two, it can be at your house,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea. “Burning airborne materials can light fires a great distance away from the main body of fire.”\n\nFires also burning on the Big Island\n\nHawaii County officials said Tuesday that they were monitoring two brush fires burning in North and South Kohala. The fires prompted evacuations and power outages in the area.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday approved the state's request for a disaster declaration to provide assistance with \"the wind-whipped Kohala Ranch wildfire on the Big Island,\" according to a news release from the governor's office.\n\nThe fire, which began early Tuesday, threatened about 200 homes near the rural community of Kohala Ranch, a volunteer fire department, local electrical transmission lines and an AT&T cellular communications tower in the area, officials said The fire was uncontained and had burned more than 600 acres of land when the request for federal assistance was made.\n\nThe release said firefighters battling that fire and the two other uncontrolled fires on the Big Island and Maui \"have been hampered by the winds, which made it impossible to provide aircraft support for their efforts to contain the flames.\"\n\n“We’re trying to protect homes in the community,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said of evacuating about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island. As of Tuesday, the roof of one house caught on fire, he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/14/indonesia-volcano/5478815/", "title": "Indonesia volcano erupts; 3 killed, 100K evacuated", "text": "Niniek Karmini\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAsh shrouds large parts of Java\n\nMount Kelud eruption heard 125 miles away\n\nMore than 100%2C000 people evacuated\n\nSUGIHWARAS, Indonesia (AP) — A powerful volcanic eruption on Indonesia's most populous island blasted ash and debris 18 kilometers (12 miles) into the air Friday, killing three people and forcing authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 and close seven airports.\n\nThe eruption of Mount Kelud on Java island could be heard up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) away, Indonesia's disaster agency said.\n\n\"The eruption sounded like thousands of bombs exploding,\" Ratno Pramono, a 35-year-old farmer, said as he checked his property in the village of Sugihwaras, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crater. \"I thought doomsday was upon us. Women and children were screaming and crying.\"\n\nAsh and grit fell to earth in towns and cities across the region, including Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city after Jakarta, with a population of about 3 million. It also fell farther afield in Yogyakarta, where motorists switched on headlights in daylight. Workers attempted to cover the famed ninth century Buddhist temple complex of Borobudur with plastic sheeting to protect it.\n\nA 60-year-old woman and an 80-year-old man were killed in the village of Pandansari, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the mountain, when the roofs of their homes collapsed under the weight of the ash and volcanic debris, the disaster agency said. A 70-year-old man died after being hit by a collapsed wall while waiting to be evacuated from the same village, where the volcanic ash reached 20 centimeters (8 inches) deep in some places.\n\nThe large international airport in Surabaya and airports in the cities of Malang, Yogyakarta, Solo, Bandung, Semarang and Cilacap were closed due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, Transport Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said. Virgin Australia said it canceled its Friday flights from Australia to several locations due to the eruption, including the resort islands of Bali in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand.\n\nThe disaster agency said tremors were still wracking the volcano but that scientists didn't expect another major eruption. It said residents of all villages within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Kelud — more than 100,000 people — had been evacuated to temporary shelters, but that some were returning to their homes to begin cleaning up.\n\nThe 1,731-meter (5,680-foot) -high mountain in eastern Java — Indonesia's most densely populated island and home to more than half of the country's 240 million people — had been rumbling for several weeks and was under close observation. The mountain is about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.\n\nAs night fell, the volcano continued to rumble, spewing ash high into the air, though smaller amounts than earlier.\n\n\"It seems Kelud isn't finished yet,\" said Retno Dwiningtyas, a mother of three who was sitting in a government shelter watching television reports of her village showing crumpled roofs, farms and broken chairs blanketed with thick gray ash. \"We are afraid for our cattle, our farm.\"\n\nMuhammad Hendrasto, head of Indonesia's volcano monitoring agency, said the mountain erupted violently about 90 minutes after authorities raised its alert status to the highest level. The disaster agency said it had spewed millions of cubic meters of debris into the atmosphere.\n\nKediri, a normally bustling town about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the mountain, was largely deserted as residents stayed indoors to avoid the choking ash.\n\n\"The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,\" said Kediri resident Insaf Wibowo.\n\nSome residents were shoveling the ash and grit into sacks to use in the construction of buildings or to fertilize crops. One collector said that middlemen had already told him they would pay up to $56 for a small truck filled with the debris.\n\nKelud is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The archipelagic nation is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" — a series of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and Southeast Asia.\n\nDue to the fertile volcanic soil and the shortage of space on Java, hundreds of thousands of people live close to active volcanoes. They are used to the rumblings, but their proximity to the peaks presents difficulties for authorities.\n\nKelud's last major eruption was in 1990, when it spewed out searing fumes and lava that killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds. In 1919, a powerful explosion that reportedly could be heard hundreds of kilometers (miles) away killed at least 5,160 people.\n\nEarlier this month, Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province erupted as authorities were allowing thousands of villagers who had been evacuated to return to its slopes, killing 16 people.

But clouds of ash blew more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) north, reaching the bustling capital, Manila, and forcing the shutdown of the country’s main airport with more than 240 international and domestic flights cancelled so far.\n\nAn alternative airport north of Manila at Clark freeport remained open but authorities would shut it down too if ashfall threatens flights, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said.\n\nThe government’s disaster-response agency reported about 8,000 villagers have moved to at least 38 evacuation centers in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite province, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more being brought out of harm’s way. Some residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages due to a lack of transport and poor visibility. Some refused to leave their homes and farms, officials said.\n\n“We have a problem, our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” Mayor Wilson Maralit of Balete town told DZMM radio. “We’re trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again anytime and hit them.”\n\nMaralit, whose town lies along the coastline of Taal Lake surrounding the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and additional police to be deployed to stop distraught residents from sneaking back to their high-risk coastal villages.\n\n'It's a risk':Questions about volcano tourism safety arise after New Zealand eruption\n\nAfter months of restiveness that began last year, Taal suddenly rumbled back to life Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.\n\nThe government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches to level 4, indicating “an imminent hazardous eruption.” Level 5, the highest, means a hazardous eruption is underway and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute.\n\nMa. Antonio Bornas, the agency’s chief volcanologist, said lava spurted out in fountains from the volcano early Monday while its ash and steam ejections eased. It’s hard to tell when the eruption would stop, she said, citing Taal’s similar restiveness in the 1970s that lasted for about four months.\n\nThe volcanology institute reminded the public that the small island where the volcano lies is a “permanent danger zone,” although fishing villages have existed there for years.

Some residents have raised concerns about noise, traffic and parking, and have alleged public drunkenness.\n\nDelaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner John Cordrey said he would render his decision in the near future.\n\nCordrey presided over three-and-a-half hours of courtroom-style deliberation featuring attorneys for the Riverfront Development Corp. and Homeowners Association for the Condominiums at Justison Landing, a development near Constitution Yards.\n\nCurrently running on a day-to-day liquor license that expired at 1 a.m. Friday, the beer garden is the most recent initiative by the nonprofit RDC, which oversees development along the Wilmington Riverfront.\n\nRDC Acting Executive Director Megan McGlinchey said the beer garden is consistent with other RDC-developed initiatives on the waterfront, including a mini golf course, Delaware Children’s Museum and an ice rink that takes the place of the seasonal beer garden during the winter months.\n\n“The whole point of the Riverfront is to create a community,” said RDC attorney Michael Hochman. “If you look at the Constitution Yard’s attraction, it’s a family-friendly attraction in keeping with other attractions on the riverfront.”\n\nHochman presented a dozen witnesses before the commissioner, many of whom were local business owners and restaurateurs.\n\nBryan Sikora, owner of La Fia Market Bistro, Cocina Lolo and Merchant Bar in Wilmington, said he hoped visitors to the beer garden would consider patronizing his restaurants on their next visit to the city.\n\n“Summertimes around here are very slow,” Sikora said. “I know my kids would be in the [beer garden’s] sandbox playing, and I’d be happy to have a beer and hang out.”\n\nIn his argument against the beer garden, attorney Stephen Spence, representing the council of Justison Landing condo owners, pointed out that the RDC saved roughly $50,000 in manual labor costs that went to the disassembling of the ice rink. Part of that structure's staging now remains a permanent part of both seasonal attractions.\n\nSpence also characterized the biennial gathering license — usually reserved for picnics, fairs and banquets by nonprofit organizations such as churches or volunteer fire companies — as an improper avenue for the RDC to pursue development on a beer garden that turned profits.\n\n“There’s something not right about that,” he said. “There may be a way to get this done, but I don’t think a biennial gathering license is it.”\n\nCharles Fleming, Jr., a representative of the council that hired Spence, said the area now occupied by the beer garden served as a much-needed green space for condo residents, who hoped to turn the land into a public park.\n\n“What we have here is a full time business operating four months, seven days a week during the school season. Kids in our building will have to try to study with a beer garden right out front,” Fleming said. “You have crowds of people who congregate when they close. You can hear people’s voices clearly, distinctly right outside your window.”\n\nContact Quint Forgey at bforgey@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @QuintForgey.\n\nWilmington's new beer garden opens to rave reviews\n\nWilmington beer garden gets temporary OK", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2020/07/15/popular-sushi-chef-host-pop-up-wilmington-beer-garden/5437849002/", "title": "Popular sushi chef to host a 'pop-up' at Wilmington beer garden", "text": "Al Chu's Sushi, one of the most well-known vendors in the DECO Food Hall, will host a pop-up eatery Friday at Constitution Yards beer garden at the Wilmington Riverfront.\n\nIt was one of the eight restaurant stalls in the DECO Food Hall at the corner of 10th and Orange streets.\n\nThe stall, featuring various kinds of sushi and poke bowls, is named for and run by Chu, the longtime sushi chef at Mikimotos in Wilmington.\n\nChanges:Hotel du Pont reopens, but lays off executive chef and other employees\n\nChu left the Washington Street restaurant in 2017 to work at The Wellwood in Charlestown, Maryland.\n\nThe DECO Food Hall, inside the historic DuPont Building in downtown Wilmington, opened to much acclaim in April 2019.

The ships’ massive diesel engines rumble in the warm July air, so powerful at times that vibrations can be felt on land.\n\nFor almost a century these giants have plied the waters of the river, from the wide Atlantic Ocean and up the Delaware River to the piers at Marcus Hook. They came largely to feed the two sprawling oil refineries that bracket this small town, the site of a recent rebirth that’s attached to Marcellus and the natural gas it has yielded.\n\nAt times, Marcus Hook makes the rust-belt towns and cities of western Pennsylvania look pastoral. It is roughly L-shaped, the stem of which, roughly three blocks wide and 12 blocks long, runs from the northwest to the southeast, dead-ending at the river.\n\nMarket Street, which runs down the center of the stem, is lined with the standard shops and businesses, old brick row homes, and a few modern colonial homes that have gone up in recent years to house the 2,300 people who live here. To the southwest, rising beyond the roofs is the Sunoco Refinery and, to the northeast — beyond the graveyard at Bible Presbyterian Church, where graves date to the 1800s — the tank farms of the Monroe Energy refinery.\n\nThe refineries powered the nation, fueled Ally fighter planes during World War II and provided the lifeblood of this tiny square-mile-sized borough. In its heyday, folks say, the town had a population of more than 5,000 — and 36 bars.\n\nDwarfing the Hook itself, the refineries seemed immutable — permanent, near sacrosanct reminders of the power of American ingenuity and industrialization. As long as there was oil, there would be the Hook.\n\n“Everyone always said, ‘Oh, the Sun will never set on Marcus Hook,’” said Michael Manerchia, a borough council member.\n\nFor more than 100 years the Sunoco oil refinery, commonly called Sun Oil in reference to Sunoco’s predecessor and its builder, served as the bedrock for the town. Generations of men worked there, fathers, sons and grandfathers.\n\nThen one Friday — now almost five years ago — the company called the town’s mayor on the phone. Sunoco’s refinery operations had been hemorrhaging money for years, losses driven primary by then-high crude oil prices and the downturn in the economy. The company had been shopping for a buyer and when one didn’t emerge, it determined it was going to cut its losses.\n\nSunoco told the mayor the Marcus Hook refinery would be shutting down. The 500-odd men working there were done.\n\n“The whole town just went crazy,” Manerchia said.\n\nMarcus Hook’s fortunes have always risen and fallen with the tides of the Delaware River. The river is deep here and it flows fast toward the Atlantic Ocean, about 80 miles to the south. Each day it twice rises and falls roughly six feet, driven by the inexorable forces of the sun and the moon.\n\nClank’s Bar and Pizza on Market Street is a microcosm of the town itself, a town where a proud past is tightly woven into the fabric of the community. But as the plants idled and unemployment rose the town was left with a dire prospect: No longer a showcase of the industrialized might of the United States, instead it would become a museum showcasing the slow death of manufacturing, the empty plants living exhibits to a dying way of life.\n\nThe graveyard of American Viscose, once just a reminder of the past, was starting to become a harbinger of the future.\n\nAfter more than 100 years, it appeared that the Sun was finally setting on Marcus Hook. The tide that had brought the great ships and the lifeblood of oil to this port was rolling back, the waters of the Delaware River, like time itself, quickly rushing past.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty miles west of the Delaware River, on a hilltop near the small town of Hickory, Range Resources made history. It was February 2006, and the company was preparing to drill the first horizontal well in Pennsylvania.\n\nRange was searching for gas in the Marcellus Shale formation, and in May the Pennsylvania department of Environmental Protection reported that the drilling rig was set up, the frack tanks filled.\n\nFive months later the drilling was complete, and the race to the Marcellus was underway.\n\nOver the next seven years the amount of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania would increase 20-fold, pumped out of the ground at a prodigious rate in the rural hills of western and northern Pennsylvania.\n\nDrilling proceeded so quickly it not only outpaced regulations but the infrastructure necessary to transport it to market.\n\nAs it comes from the wellhead, natural gas is not a singular compound. Rather it is a blend of other hydrocarbons, including ethane and propane, commonly referred to as natural gas liquids, or NGLs for short.\n\nAlthough these fuels can be separated out, the sheer volume of gas being produced means that the infrastructure necessary to do so hasn’t kept pace, and, according to a 2014 report by the Public Utility Commission, “a significant amount of NGLs are simply sold directly into the natural gas system.”\n\nFour years before Range drilled its well, Sunoco had spun off its vast pipeline network into a new company, Sunoco Logistics, headquartered in Philadelphia. It included the pipeline built by Sun Oil, which continued to pump oil products — gasoline, diesel, etc. — from the coast to the west.\n\nIn 2012, Sunoco, still looking for a buyer for the Marcus Hook refinery, was itself bought by another company, Energy Transfer. In Philadelphia, the folks at Sunoco Logistics saw an opportunity and did the math:\n\nThere was a glut of natural gas products sitting in western Pennsylvania.\n\nThe company had an existing pipeline running through the area to the coast.\n\nThere was an 800-acre refinery for sale down the road, with massive storage space and port terminals.\n\nIt was time to roll the dice.\n\nAt the 800-acre Marcus Hook Industrial Complex, close to a thousand men are working nearly around the clock, their time punctuated by the steady, rhythmic pounding of a pile driver.\n\nThe industrial park is a massive, sprawling affair. A bewildering web of pipelines, compressors and storage tanks flows in every conceivable direction through the site.\n\nNear the port terminals, giant storage tanks are rising above ground. Taken as a unit, they are capable of holding close to 800,000 barrels of propane and ethane. Cranes hover overhead while ant-sized contractors build the giant tanks.\n\nAt the piers, The Atlantic Gas, call sign OWMB2, is being loaded with propane at a rate of 2,500 barrels per hour. In a few days, it will set sail for Tarragona, Spain, before stopping at Gibraltar and returning to Marcus Hook.\n\nSunoco Logistics is spending roughly $2.5 billion on the Mariner East projects, ripping out old oil refinery equipment and replacing it with the tools and machinery necessary to store, process and ship billions of gallons of propane and ethane. When the upgrades are completed, the rate at which ships can be loaded will increase 10-fold.\n\nAt the same time, it has repurposed the old Sun Oil pipeline to bring propane from the Marcellus Shale region to the east. A second pipeline, Mariner East II, is currently going through the permitting process, and Sunoco Logistics announced earlier this year it is considering a third.\n\nThe demand — and potential — is such that in Denmark the company Evergas is purchasing (at a price around $1 billion) a fleet of eight new ships, monikered as the “Dragon class,” dedicated to the Marcus Hook operation. Each ship is more than 500 feet in length, and capable of carrying more than 27,000 cubic meters of petrochemical gas — the largest ethane carriers of their type in the world.\n\nNot all of the propane is destined for other markets. At its peak, the plant can load 10,000 to 14,000 barrels per day from its storage tanks and caverns onto trucks destined for the local market — primarily during winter when demand for propane is high.\n\nThe Mariner East projects are both large and small in scale. While they will connect the western part of the state to the port at Marcus Hook, only a small fraction of the former-refinery-now-industrial-park will be used by Sunoco Logistics.\n\nThe jobs that Marcus Hook lost when the refiner shutdown also will not be coming back in a wave. Sunoco Logistics said it only plans to employ around 200 people when the propane and ethane station is fully operational.\n\nInstead, Sunoco Logistics is betting that it can lure other companies onto the former refinery, which could use its propane and ethane to create other products. Some of the rest of the industrial site is already being leased to tenants — a natural gas power plant and a plastics manufacturer.\n\nFour blocks to the northeast, beyond the Hook’s row homes and churches, the Monroe Energy refinery also is busy. At the same time Sunoco Logistics was buying the Sunoco refinery, Monroe was buying the old ConocoPhilips plant down the street.\n\nMonroe wasn’t interested in shale gas. Rather, its parent company, Delta Airlines, was looking for fuel. High oil prices had increased the price of jet fuel, so in 2012 Delta decided that rather than buying it from a third party, it would make its own.\n\nDespite the drop in oil prices, Delta’s bet has paid off. It bought the refinery for $150 million, and, over the last year, Monroe has posted a profit of $300 million.\n\nMarcus Hook is a study in contrasts. It is surrounded by the might of the petrochemical industry, and yet it dead ends against the banks of the river in a verdant green park, softly shadowed by old oak trees. There is a pavilion, a band stage, and monuments to the men and women from the town who served in the nation’s wars.\n\nAgainst the river, there are benches where the town’s older residents gather daily, watching the ship traffic on the Delaware River and fishing from a pier. In September the park will host the annual pirate festival, an homage to the Hook’s colorful past.\n\nAnd yet within spitting distance of the park are the twin refineries — the sprawling plants that for more than 100 years have defined this town. Flames flare from a stack at the Sunoco Logistics park while a massive oil tanker is bellying up to the Monroe Energy piers, massive engines shaking the ground.\n\nThe wind is blowing off the river, as it often does. It brings with it the faint smell of the sea — and the promise of a wider world beyond the mouth of the Delaware.\n\nOut on the Delaware River, the great ships are once again sailing for Marcus Hook, born by a rising tide.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/11/13/kirkwood-country-club-coming-soon-forgotten-mini-mall-near-newark-delaware/71532660007/", "title": "Kirkwood 'Country Club' coming to forgotten mini mall near Newark", "text": "It doesn’t look like the place for a country club.\n\nBut the sign says otherwise.\n\nOn a flyby stretch of Kirkwood Highway bisecting Milltown and Stanton, lined by a defunct Friendly’s and mini-malls in need of tender loving care, a full-sized billboard now greets drivers speeding by in both directions: “KIRKWOOD COUNTRY CLUB: COMING SOON!”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/09/26/singer-dar-williams-explores-wilmingtons-revitalization-new-book/681002001/", "title": "Singer Dar Williams examines Wilmington in new book", "text": "It was nearly 22 years ago when singer/songwriter Dar Williams first found herself in downtown Wilmington, preparing for a show at The Grand.\n\nBack then, Market Street was a pedestrian mall in the area, cut off from traffic. Broken-down building facades greeted visitors by day with roll-down security gates covering shuttered storefronts at night.\n\nThe LOMA revitalization had not yet occurred and the Riverfront redevelopment was just getting started.\n\nFast-forward to one of Williams' more recent Wilmington returns — her 2012 show at The Queen with indie folk duo The Milk Carton Kids — and she found herself marveling at what she found, especially at the Riverfront.\n\nSTORY: Aubrey Plaza, John Gallagher Jr. coming home for block party\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nSTORY: Crepes, craft brews & more headed to Wilmington's Market Street\n\nSTORY: Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan is no longer Billy Corgan\n\nWith her two children in tow, ages 8 and 3, Williams and Milk Carton Kids guitarist/singer Joey Ryan walked down to the Christina River. The foursome ate lunch at Harry's Seafood Grill, checked out Thomas Burke's Andrew Wyeth-inspired birdhouses that line the Riverwalk and played at the Delaware Children's Museum.\n\nWilliams saw firsthand what a waterfront can do for a city — even if that city still had plenty of work still to do.\n\nThe result of that fascination is a 22-page chapter all about Wilmington and its Riverfront in Williams' newly-released book, \"What I Found in a Thousand Towns: A Traveling Musician's Guide to Rebuilding America's Communities — One Coffee Shop, Dog Run and Open-Mike Night at a Time\" ($27, Basic Books).\n\nThe in-depth examination of Wilmington's push to revitalize its Riverfront and downtown will be the centerpiece of Williams' concert/book reading at Arden's Gild Hall (2126 The Highway) Oct. 12 at 8 p.m. (Tickets for the show, $30, are expected to sell out.)\n\nWilliams will also lead a question-and-answer session with fans about the past and future of Wilmington.\n\nHer love of urban planning grew out of her time touring the country, driving from town to town as a musician and noting changes after each visit.\n\n\"I realized I was basically a field worker for 20 years because I was watching how towns are coming up,\" Williams told The News Journal during a recent interview to preview her Arden tour stop.\n\nBefore Michael Purzycki was sworn in to become the 56th mayor of Wilmington, he headed the public/private Riverfront Development Corporation group, established by the General Assembly in 1995 to transform the forgotten wasteland into a cultural and recreational hub.\n\nThat made Purzycki a good interview subject for Williams, whose 288-page book also details urban planning successes in other towns that she has visited with her folk music, including nearby Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.\n\nWilliams ended up meeting with the not-yet-mayor, impressing Purzycki with both her passion for livable space and knowledge of Wilmington's slow march toward making downtown and the Riverfront a desirable place to live.\n\n\"I had no idea who she was, but heard she was interested,\" Purzycki remembers. \"She just came and I found myself so charmed by her authenticity. She's priceless.\"\n\nThe two talked about how the Riverfront has grown from a place to avoid to a magnet for all types of people: families bouncing at the Altitude Trampoline Park, young professionals gulping at Constitution Yards Beer Garden and fitness nuts lifting at CrossFit RiverFront.\n\nIn a city that she once believed had a \"piñata problem\" — great corporate wealth all around with little of that same affluence on the ground level — Williams now saw the names of the multi-national companies like DuPont and Bank of America as corporate sponsors of this new public space, which is open to all.\n\n\"I realized that I had completely changed my impression of Wilmington from a piñata city to a city that welcomes people from all walks of life, with all they have to offer,\" Williams writes. \"Thanks to Riverfront Wilmington, and some parts of the city growing around it, the city now has a stronger claim that it is growing in prosperity for all, not just a small segment of its population that holds the moneybags.\"\n\nAt the same time, Williams was aware that not all city-dwellers feel the same. During last year's mayoral race, some who live in neighborhoods plagued by shootings and crime complained that they had been forgotten while needed resources went to the Riverfront and downtown revitalization instead.\n\nWhile the long-simmering resentment remains for some, Purzycki says he's working to make the city better for all, pointing to a new detailed survey all Wilmington residents have been asked to take.\n\nThe community-driven effort is called \"Wilmington 2028\" and it's intended to help guide the city's development over the next decade, asking about everything from quality of life issues like safety and sense of community to affordability, entertainment and dining.\n\n\"We need to make people feel like they are invested in the city. We have people who, I think, feel they have been alienated from the rest of the prosperity in the city for too long,\" Purzycki says. \"Getting them involved is the only way this is going to succeed.\"\n\nWilliams has seen it work in other cities and says she has hope for Wilmington: \"The neighborhoods are all beautiful and they can all come up. And when they do, by the way, they do. People will point to these neighborhoods as success stories.\"\n\nFor his part, Purzycki learned something from Williams, as well: she's a damn good singer and songwriter.\n\nBefore she left, Williams gave him a copy of her most recent album, 2015's \"Emerald.\" A couple of years later, it's still in his car where it continues to spin in his CD player.\n\n\"I\"m going to go see her if I can and the deal is this,\" Purzycki proposes. \"She's going to have to play 'Slippery Slope' for me because I just love this song.\"\n\nWhile Williams uses Wilmington to make her case that waterfronts are a great use of public space, she's less bullish on the city's efforts to reinvigorate downtown. And that's even after getting a tour of the home and violin shop of David Bromberg, the well-known musician who was lured from Chicago to Market Street in 2002 with economic incentives.\n\nDuring her most recent visits to the city, the ghosts of previous visits remain in the financial district: empty sidewalks at night, closed businesses and little to no nightlife spilling into the streets. Sure, it's better than it was years ago, but the progress has not matched the Riverfront's revival.\n\n\"It feels empty, but there's still an opportunity to put something in there so there's a day purpose and a night purpose,\" says Williams, 50, of New York. \"I'm always cheerleading for more life in the financial district even though the buildings do very well on their own for the economy during the day.\"\n\nIn addition to Purzycki, Williams also interviewed Villanova University's David Fiorenza for her book.\n\nThe economics instructor, who teaches a class on Wilmington's revitalization, bumped into Williams as a WXPN fundraiser in Philadelphia and heard her talking about urban renewal.\n\nSoon, they were chatting each other up. Not long after, Williams was sitting in on his urban economic classes and picking his brain about his case studies. By the time she was done, she had made yet another new fan.\n\n\"When we first met, I thought it was just the alcohol talking between her and I — the bourbon she had and the beers that I had. But, no, she really had a passion for revitalizing cities,\" Fiorenza says. \"And it's not a quick process. It took a generation for these cities to crumble and it's going to take a generation for them to revitalize fully and she understands that.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

That’s three steps from the big leagues in the new 12-team High-A East.\n\nThey are now affiliated with the Washington Nationals. The Blue Rocks had been part of the Kansas City Royals’ organization since 1993 except for two seasons (2005-06) with the Boston Red Sox.\n\nROCK ON: Blue Rocks survive MiLB upheaval\n\nBut there is no more Carolina League, which was the Blue Rocks’ home from 1993 through 2019, when they won their fifth title but first since 1999. Presumably, they get to keep the Mills Cup championship trophy for good.\n\nThe 2019 expiration of the Professional Baseball Agreement between Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball led to a trimmed-down farm system consisting of just four affiliated levels. Leagues are now named simply by geographic location.\n\nThe Blue Rocks are one of five teams in the High-A East’s North Division with Tuesday’s visitor from down I-95, Maryland’s Aberdeen IronBirds (Orioles), along with the Jersey Shore Blue Claws (Phillies), and New York’s Brooklyn Cyclones (Mets) and Hudson Valley Renegades (Yankees). The South’s Winston-Salem (N.C.) Dash are the only remaining Carolina League outfit at this level.\n\nAs fans streamed up the stairs into the stadium Tuesday night, ticket takers Gwen Coughlin and Dave Houtman greeted them with a year’s worth of pent-up enthusiasm.\n\n“When they said they weren’t gonna open [last year], I was broken-hearted,” said Houtman, an energetic 84-year-old from suburban Newark. “I cannot just sit around and do nothing. I’m afraid I’d get fat and die and I don’t want to do that.”\n\nStadium capacity is presently limited to 25% with seating pods of two, three or four. Attendance Tuesday night was 1,381.\n\nFace coverings are also required except when food and beverages are being consumed.\n\nHoutman was starting his 25th year working Blue Rocks games, coming back each spring because of the joy he gets being around people who are just happy to be at the ballpark.\n\n“When they come in, most of them are just tickled to death to be back here,” Houtman said.\n\nTo limit travel with the COVID-19 pandemic still lingering, teams will play six-game series that run from Tuesday through Sunday with Monday as an off day.\n\nDIAMOND JUBILEE: Midway honors Little League’s oldest coach\n\nIt’s a 120-game schedule, as opposed to the previous 140 games, and runs from May 4 through Sept. 19. The Phillies’ Blue Claws visit next week with former St. Mark’s High and University of Delaware pitcher Billy Sullivan on the staff.\n\nWilmington resident Coughlin was practically moved to tears, she admitted, by the opening night fanfare and the reunion with her co-workers.\n\n“This is like Christmas for me,” she said. “It was really, really tough last year. No games. A few of us used to get together in the parking lot with masks and we just met because this is like our family. I missed everybody dearly, just the whole electric atmosphere of the game.”\n\nThe Blue Rocks’ starting pitcher Tuesday night was Jackson Rutledge, who was Washington’s No. 1 pick, 17th overall, in the 2019 draft out of San Jacinto Junior College in Texas.\n\nHe didn’t have a 2020 season but did earn an invite to the Nationals’ alternate site in Fredericksburg, Virginia, after the big-league season started in July. Before that, he’d tried to stay fit at home, including lifting buckets of cement purchased at Home Depot for strength training, said his mother, Susan.\n\nSusan Rutledge was wearing her son’s red Nationals jersey from that 2020 summer stint in Fredericksburg in her seat down the right-field line Tuesday night after flying in for the game from St. Louis near the family’s Missouri home.\n\n“He’s very excited just to get into the routine of playing games, just getting back on the field,” she said.\n\n“It feels like home, really,” she said of being at the ballpark with husband Josh. “We’re really excited to be here.”\n\nRutledge was one of the few bright spots in Tuesday’s 10-1 loss in which the Blue Rocks managed just three hits. The 6-foot-8 right-hander allowed three hits and two earned runs while walking three and whiffing four in 4⅔ innings.\n\nBlue Rocks manager Tommy Shields and players were not available for postgame interviews.\n\nNearly 200 modern Blue Rocks have gone on to play in the majors, including standouts such as Carlos Beltran, Johnny Damon and Zack Greinke and several members of Red Sox and Royals World Series champions.\n\nA previous Wilmington Blue Rocks franchise played in the Interstate League from 1940-52 at the since-razed Wilmington Ball Park at 30th Street and Gov. Printz Blvd. That team was tied in with the Philadelphia Athletics from 1940-43 and Phillies from 1944-52 and featured future Hall-of-Fame pitcher Robin Roberts.\n\nFans had to wait 41 years for the return of the Rocks in 1993. The one-year pandemic-imposed hiatus of 2020 was far shorter but, because of its unexpected and unprecedented nature, equally unwelcomed.\n\nBecause of COVID protocols, the between-innings antics and contests are temporarily absent.\n\nBut baseball is back, and that’s what mattered most.\n\n“I missed this,” Houtman said as he prepared to scan another ticket bar code. “I don’t know how I did without this to tell you the truth.’’\n\nThere was no guarantee Wilmington would still have a team after MLB’s hostile takeover.\n\nBut the Blue Rocks were Tuesday night, though surprisingly still wearing uniforms trimmed in the Royals’ navy blue and sky blue rather than the Nationals’ navy blue and red.\n\n“I’m glad they came back,” McDermott said.\n\nNew loop\n\nThe Carolina League is no more.

His status as the executive director of the RDC helped him gain credibility as someone who could bring money into the city. But some people who live in neighborhoods away from the Riverfront, where tens of millions of dollars were invested, feel Purzycki doesn't understand their plight.\n\n“He doesn't have strong ties within many of the neighborhoods,” said Kathleen Patterson, president of the 2nd District Neighborhood Planning Council, which represents the Triangle neighborhood. “Many people are wary of corporate managers and that is the background many residents attach to him.”\n\nThat could cause an uphill battle for Purzycki connecting with constituents. The next mayor of Wilmington will be inheriting a ninth-floor City Hall office looking out onto a community with a nearly 7 percent unemployment rate, 110 shootings this year and ongoing concerns about businesses leaving.\n\nRepublican opponent Robert Martin said Purzycki is \"out of touch\" with Wilmingtonians.\n\n“Some of the people shot on these streets, I knew them personally,\" he said.\n\nPurzycki, who previously served on the New Castle County Council, admits his challenge is making headway in the community to close divisions and restoring the mayor's office, which has been hit by resident frustration under the administration of Dennis P. Williams, who finished fourth in Tuesday's primary.\n\nBy improving the infrastructure of the city, Purzycki believes he can change the culture of violence. He was named executive director of the RDC in 1996, and the group is credited with bringing restaurants, shops and attractions to what had been a run-down section of the Christina River.\n\nAs mayor, Purzycki envisions a city with facades illuminated with light, bustling restaurants downtown, bike lanes on Union Street and cranes throughout the city building new residences and business spaces, he told The News Journal.\n\n“I want people to come into the city and be struck by how beautiful it is,” he said.\n\nWhereas Williams, a former police officer, campaigned on promises he would lower the crime rate, Purzycki says improving the foundation of the city will change mindsets. He said the crime rate will follow suit.\n\n“Culture trumps strategy every time,” he said.\n\nBridging the gap\n\nThe father of two adult children, Purzycki, 71, lives with his wife in the Highlands where they also are raising a 14-year-old.\n\nHe defeated incumbent Williams and six others with significant help from 1,673 votes (more than half of his 2,968 total) around his neighborhood, City Council District 8. He did not win any other district, but his moderate support throughout the city coupled with his showing at home led him to the nomination with just 23 percent of the vote — 234 votes ahead of Eugene Young and 415 over Kevin Kelley.\n\nThe Highlands, in the northwest part of the city near Greenville, is in a ZIP code with million-dollar homes and nearly nonexistent crime.\n\nSome observers think Purzycki has a chance to unite the various factions that developed during the hard-fought campaign.\n\nThe jam-packed ballot and limited would-be voters meant the candidates had to fight for a very narrow piece of the electorate that was already tiny. Williams, after all, won the 2012 primary with 4,244 votes. Purzycki allies saw a window in non-Democrats. The group “Republicans and Independents for Mike\" was started to send mailers and make phone calls.\n\n\"It is no secret that the next mayor will be a Democrat and will be chosen in the Sept. 13 primary,” read a letter on the group’s website. “Our only option is to switch parties.”\n\nIt was signed by Jane Castle, the wife of Mike Castle, the last Republican Delaware governor.\n\nRegistered Democrats in Delaware's largest city outnumber Republicans 5 to 1, and the party has dominated the city since the 1950s. The split means the primary acts as a de facto general election, all but guaranteeing the winner will go on to victory in November.\n\nStill, some residents are cautiously optimistic about a possible Purzycki administration.\n\nThe Rev. Sandra Ben, president of the Northeast Civic Association, said she invited Purzycki to civic meetings and walkabouts with a group called Safe United Neighborhoods, but she has yet to hear from him.\n\n“I am hoping that he will be more visible in the Northeast area,” she said, adding that citizens should be involved in the new mayor’s decision-making process. “I am hoping that he sees the need to involve and support all the civic associations and nonprofit organizations like S.U.N. that have been working in the trenches already to help make a difference, especially in keeping our youth off the streets.”\n\nGreg Luna, president of the Cool Spring-Tilton Neighborhood Association, said his community has benefited from community policing and is pleased that Purzycki supports it. He urged Purzycki, if elected in the fall, to return to neighborhoods where he struggled in the primary.\n\n“It can be one of the most challenging situations for an elected official,” Luna said. “However, if he returns to those communities with tangible accomplishments that benefit those same communities, he will do well.”\n\nLeroy Tice is a Wilmington attorney who, with Purzycki, serves on the board of the Hope Commission, a community betterment association founded by former Mayor James Baker. Tice said the candidate will have to earn the trust of residents who question whether he can be a mayor to the whole city — but he has no doubt that he will.\n\nRochester, Bonini, Purzycki secure victories\n\nMike Purzycki wins Wilmington mayoral primary\n\n“Forming an impression about Mike Purzycki in 30 seconds, what information would you have? That he spent some time at the Riverfront, which is a mere slice of this city,” Tice said.\n\nWhen Tice first met Purzycki, he was impressed by his accomplishments but questioned his involvement in the Hope Commission.\n\n“Why is this man, who could be anywhere in the world he wants to be, sitting in Hope Commission meetings, and why is he the lead of every project? I’ll admit I asked that question. And the answer I’ve come to is that is who he is,” he said.\n\nTice, who is black, criticized “African-American leadership” who engaged in “the politics of division” during the primary campaign. He said the city should “leave the doubt and cynicism at home.”\n\n“Mike has defined himself,” he said. “He is committed to the issues that matter — and the issues he’s committed to most are the ones that matter most to those who don’t look like him.”\n\nMaking the city safe\n\nPurzycki, who also led in the fundraising race among the eight candidates, said if he was elected his administration would tackle crime holistically. In addition to community policing, he said he would focus on strengthening the foundation of neighborhoods with what he calls a “neighborhood stabilization strategy.”\n\nA team of representatives from the police, license and inspections, public works, and parks departments — and potentially state health and social services — would be assigned to an area, Purzycki said.\n\n“That team then becomes accountable for behaviors and statistical incidents within a particular area,” he said. “That way, everybody owns it. They’re responsible for its appearance, for the crime, for the parks.”\n\nThe team would manage a range of issues, from crime to overflowing sewage and overgrown weeds, he said.\n\n“When you feel the sting of failure, you’re going to be part of the solution,” he said. “If everybody keeps blaming someone else, nobody gets things done.”\n\nRochester, Bonini, Purzycki secure victories\n\nClear fundraising leaders emerge in primary races\n\nPublic safety was a central issue in the campaign and a key criticism of the Williams administration. The mayor has repeatedly come under fire for not reining in street violence, which has garnered national attention. Newsweek infamously wrote about the city’s struggles in a December 2014 story headlined “Murder Town USA (AKA Wilmington, Delaware)\" and ABC had considered creating a legal drama called “Murder Town” set in the city.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year issued a historic report of gun violence in Wilmington, saying the shootings amounted to a public health issue. The crime issue has raised concerns that major corporations would leave the city. The Legislature and Gov. Jack Markell created a special panel, the Wilmington Public Safety Strategies Commission, to address the problem and make recommendations.\n\nThere have been 17 fatal shootings this year. Last year saw 151 shooting victims citywide and 26 killed.\n\nWilliams, who was unavailable to comment for this article, has said the Police Department has put measures in place, including a real-time crime center to identify hotspots and the hiring of former Philadelphia police Chief Charles Ramsey as a consultant.\n\nWilliams also was criticized for refusing to accept $1.5 million in state assistance for additional police patrols because lawmakers wanted to know where officers would be deployed. They also wanted the city to implement the safety commission’s suggestions. The mayor, who spent 17 years representing North Wilmington in the state Legislature, has said state lawmakers were trying to take over the Police Department.\n\n“As an elected official who has assumed the responsibility of maintaining our home rule and ability to govern, I have taken offense to the senseless and unfair stipulations placed on Wilmington. The city of Wilmington is not for sale!” Williams wrote in a December Facebook message.\n\nTreating a city infested with crime and blight takes time. Some residents want to see immediate changes.\n\nVerna T. Johnson has been president of the River Commons Apartments Resident Council, near Compton Park, for 15 years. Her message to city leaders: “Get some recreation to get these kids out of the street. That’s why they run around in gangs. They don’t have no place to go.”\n\nMichelle Harlee, president of the Compton Park Homeowners Association and a City Council candidate, also wants to see more assistance for young people.\n\n\"The 4th District would like the next mayor to work with the community to provide more resources for youth services after school and more diverse businesses at the riverfront and downtown,\" she said.\n\nDeveloping Wilmington\n\nPurzycki envisions an “aggressive rebuilding program” for the city and said drivers entering the city shouldn’t see “10-foot high weeds and a rusted fence.”\n\n“That suggests to you that there’s someone who neglects it,” he said.\n\nPurzycki said the development model employed at the Riverfront could be duplicated throughout the city. The first step is to create a zoning overlay so that certain buildings, like warehouses in the case of the waterfront, are not permitted. Then he would tackle blight, and install infrastructure, like the riverwalk and the Tubman-Garrett Riverfront Park.\n\n“You start to create the string that would have the pearls attached,” he said.\n\nPurzycki finds strength in neighborhood voters\n\nPrimary ushers in new look for Wilmington City Council\n\nFrom there, businesses and restaurants will come, he said. Slowly.\n\nPurzycki said places like Constitution Yards, a seasonal beer garden that opened in June, add value to neighborhoods.\n\n“It’s just alive and it’s fun and you feel like this is a real live city,” he said. “This is the stuff I’m so proud of.”\n\nBobby Mieczkowski, president of the Bayard Square Neighborhood Association, said “anyone would have been an improvement over the current administration,” but he believes Purzycki’s business skills will have a trickle-down effect.\n\nAttracting businesses \"is something that can positively affect so many parts of the city and give the administration the tools and money to drive change,” he said.\n\nIn August, there were 2,334 people unemployed in Wilmington, which has a 6.8 percent unemployment rate, not seasonally adjusted, according to the Delaware Department of Labor. That rate was 5 percent nationally in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“As long as you’ve got huge economic disparities, there is no bringing people together,” Purzyki said. “The way to bring people together is for them to share the prosperity, start to have the same attitude about life, taxes and governance.”\n\nRestaurants and entertainment could also be key to job creation in Wilmington, particularly downtown, he said. There are about a dozen Riverfront restaurants that each employ 80 to 100 people, said Purzycki, who in mayoral debates was criticized for appearing concerned about job-creation on the waterfront, not citywide.\n\nPurzycki’s plan for the city includes a high level of residential construction that will open the door for \"hundreds and hundreds of jobs\" like roofing, painting and masonry. He would like to see an apprenticeship program that graduates to professional work.\n\nThe city would also benefit from “enterprise and opportunity zones” in which new companies would locate to the city and receive tax and regulatory inducements for hiring locals, Purzycki said. Garasches Lane in Southbridge could be one such location, he said.\n\n“It’s a pretty wide-reaching plan for economic development with the overarching belief that if you don’t get people working, none of this is going to work.”\n\nTransitioning to a new administration\n\nDuring some mayoral forums, Democratic candidates spoke about ousting city officials. Purzycki declined to comment on who he would replace but indicated there would be turnover if he takes office.\n\n“Any new mayor is going to want to bring in his own team,” he said. “It’s not just the Police Department. That’s going to be the Planning Department, public works and everybody else. You want to assemble a team of people who share your view of how to make the city better.”\n\nPurzycki acknowledged there are city departments of which he doesn’t have independent knowledge, like the Police Department. He said he would hire leadership he trusts and give them the freedom to do their jobs.\n\n“I’m not going to tell people how to do their business any more than I tell my cardiologist how I want him to take care of my heart surgery,” he said.\n\nPurzycki said for some positions, he may search outside the city or state.\n\nBaker, who was mayor for three terms, advised the new mayor to hire people with governmental experience.\n\n“I don’t care how smart you are, if you don’t understand city government and the rules and limitations it has, you’ll get yourself in trouble,” he said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, said Purzycki should hire his runner-up Young, the advocacy director for the Delaware Center for Justice. Young is a former aide to another U.S. senator — Cory Booker, of New Jersey.\n\nYoung and Purzycki clashed several times during debates, most notably when the eventual nominee questioned whether the 33-year-old wasn't proven enough to run the city.\n\n“My hope is he’ll reach out to Eugene Young and find a significant role for Eugene to play in a new administration,” said Carper, who attended Purzycki's Tuesday night victory party at the Chase Center. “Eugene is a bright young man. … He’s a keeper.”\n\nYoung responded in a statement by saying, \"After putting all my heart and energy into this race I'm taking this time to talk with my family and colleagues about what the future looks like.\"\n\nCarper, who lives in Wilmington's Brandywine Hills neighborhood, said the primary election yielded “a lot of new blood” and will result in city, county and state representatives “that will work as one.” Communication and collaboration suffered under the Williams administration, Carper said, but Purzycki can help mend ties.\n\n“This guy knows how to work with people,” he said. “That’s a big key to getting things done.”\n\nEd Osborne, Williams’s campaign manager, said if elected, Purzycki may struggle with the challenges of the job.\n\n“I think he’ll find being the mayor of Wilmington and sitting on the ninth-floor is different than working from the Chase Center making choices on his own,” he said. “I think his heart is in the right place. He believes he can fix the crime like Dennis thought he could four years ago. I thought Dennis could fix it. It’s not an easy fix.”\n\nPurzycki's general election opponents say the fight isn't over.\n\nSteven Washington, the independent candidate and a Wilmington native, said he can provide inclusion that the other candidates cannot.\n\n\"Some people are hurting and they don’t feel like they’re included in the process,\" he said. \"With me, we’ll include them anytime we have to make a decision. I’m there for the people. I’m all about our community.\"\n\nBaker, who is 74 and still lives in Wilmington, said the only true test of campaign promises is enacting them.\n\n“It’s nice to get the fanfare,\" he said, \"but once you raise your hand and do the oath of office, here it comes.”\n\nReporter James Fisher contributed to this story.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at cjedra@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2837 or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\nIn upset, Meyer ousts Gordon\n\nCrowded primaries may change The Delaware Way\n\nMike Purzycki", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/04/28/hotel-boom-brewing-wilmington-riverfront/100975940/", "title": "Hotel boom brewing on Wilmington Riverfront", "text": "Scott Goss, and Christina Jedra\n\nThe News Journal\n\nDelaware's hotel industry may be about to flourish along the Wilmington Riverfront.\n\nDevelopers are racing to break ground on two high-rise projects, with a third slated to follow in the coming years.\n\nCollectively, the new hotels are expected to add 400 rooms – a three-fold increase to the once-neglected industrial area that has become a model of urban redevelopment in Delaware.\n\nThe sudden surge of development is being hailed as a potential boon to local retailers and restaurants while promising to push the Chase Center – the city's largest event space – into the next level of convention bookings.\n\n\"People are very optimistic,\" said Megan McGlinchey, executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp. \"More rooms will mean more people visiting the riverfront and that's going to generate more business for everyone.\"\n\nLearn more: Best wedding loans\n\nRELATED: Another Riverfront? Wilmington to restore Brandywine brownfield\n\nRELATED: Christina bike bridge to open unused pathways\n\nA new development team surprised Delaware's hotel industry this week by announcing plans for a seven-story, 122-room hotel and banquet hall attached to the existing Big Fish Grill on the Riverfront. The project was not on the radar of most hoteliers – a rarity among a relatively small community that typically catches wind of new developments well in advance.\n\nThe project is being undertaken by Riverfront Hotel, a limited liability corporation made up of Pennsylvania-based property developer Onix Group and Big Fish Restaurant Group, a Rehoboth Beach-based chain with 11 eateries in three states – including the 275-seat seafood restaurant on the west bank of the Christina River.\n\n\"We've always had demand for a banquet space that can hold a wedding or a 200-person event,\" Eric Sugrue, co-founder and managing partner of the restaurant group said of his longest-running Wilmington venture. \"At the end of the day, this [land] became available so I pursued it ... and it worked out to become this.\"\n\nSugrue's team says it hopes to begin construction by late summer and open a year later.\n\nDespite the aggressive timetable, the developers say they have yet to nail down financing for their $23 million project. A general contractor has not been selected. A franchise brand name has not been secured. The lot still must be cleared of industrial contamination from more than a century of use as a shipyard. And no building permits have been issued.\n\n\"I'm a little surprised they made an announcement, frankly,\" said Bill Sullivan, chairman of the Greater Wilmington Convention & Visitors Bureau and managing director of the Courtyard Newark at the University of Delaware. \"It sounds to me like they're still early in the process.\"\n\nEven with those looming unknowns, Riverfront Hotel LLC is clearly challenging the city's largest developer.\n\nBuccini/Pollin Group built the 180-room Westin Wilmington, a 10-story property connected to the Chase Center and presently the Riverfront's only hotel. It also has built several residential properties in the area, including the 214-unit Residences at Justison Landing, the 189-unit Residences at Harlan Flats and the 173-unit Residences at Christiana Landing on the east bank of the river.\n\nBPG announced last year that it had been awarded franchise approval for a 100-room Homewood Suites by Hilton and was seeking a deal to open a 200-room Marriott hotel. Both projects are planned for the Riverfront, but company officials so far have declined to say exactly where – or even which side of the river – the hotels will be built.\n\nRob Buccini, the company's co-founder and co-president, expects to break ground on the Homewood Suites project in July, with the Marriott to follow after that hotel opens.\n\n\"There will be a little competition in the short term,\" he said of the Riverfront Hotel project. \"But in the long term, I think that's going to benefit the city as a whole.\"\n\nThe big attraction\n\nThe hotel boom on the Riverfront certainly would benefit the Chase Center.\n\nWhile Daniel S. Frawley Stadium, home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, tends to catch the eyes of drivers passing by on I-95, the convention center next door is the true heart of the Riverfront – one that has evolved with each stage of the area's redevelopment.\n\nOriginally built as a 125,000-square-foot shipbuilding warehouse when the Riverfront was a thriving manufacturing center, the building was purchased by developer Verino Pettinaro in 1986 as part of a $1.2 million deal for an 86-acre swath on what by then had become an industrial wasteland.\n\nNearly a decade later, the property became the focal point of a major push to resurrect the fallow riverfront into an economic hub for the city. The taxpayer-backed Riverfront Development Corp. took control of the property and reopened the building in 1998 as an exhibition hall, a concept that fizzled after seven shows.\n\nThen headed by current Mayor Mike Purzycki, the RDC sunk an additional $7 million into the building to convert the property into a mini-convention center capable of hosting small trade shows, chamber of commerce galas and weddings. But it wasn't until BPG completed the Westin that the concept really began to take off, McGlinchey said.\n\n\"Before that, we were mostly attracting local and regional groups but not much beyond Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\" she said. \"Now we're drawing from New York to Washington, D.C., because people that attend the events can stay right next door without having to drive downtown.\"\n\nThe nearly $40 million Westin opened in 2014, but getting there was no easy feat.\n\nThen-Gov. Jack Markell's administration initially considered a $6 million letter of credit for the project in 2011 before public pressure fostered by a News Journal investigation forced them to back out. An application for a $2 million state grant was entered and then withdrawn after attracting criticism from state legislators. Finally, the city and the RDC put up $3 million in loan guarantees and BPG bought less than 1-acre of property from the RDC for $2.5 million.\n\n“The Westin was built at the bottom of the market right after the collapse,” Purzycki said. “We had to try to help these projects along. We created terms that made the financing of the project easier but didn’t give anybody any money. There were no loans. … We got all of our money back. Every single penny.”\n\nThis time around, the Riverfront hotel projects should not count on any taxpayer assistance from the city, he said.\n\nA trickle-down effect\n\nNow that the economy has improved and the Westin has proven the Riverfront as a viable market, there is far fewer questions about whether additional hotels would add economic development value to the Chase Center.\n\nIn fact, not having them has had the opposite effect, McGlinchey said.\n\n\"We've lost so many bookings because we didn't have the hotel rooms needed to support them,\" she said, citing a recent example in which a national organization of music therapists that passed on Wilmington because the city could not provide 450 hotel rooms in immediate proximity to the convention hall.\n\n\"Adding rooms would bring in a lot more groups of that size,\" she said. \"And when you have that many people here for two or three days, they're going to spend their money locally.\"\n\nMore convention attendees, she added, would mean more business for the 15-screen Penn Cinema Riverfront & IMAX, the Delaware Children's Museum, Riverwalk Mini Golf, Blue Rocks games, the Riverfront Market, the Constitution Yards beer garden or Riverfront Rink and the smattering of restaurants throughout the neighborhood.\n\nKevin Finn, chief executive officer and co-founder of Iron Hill Brewery, said the Riverfront was on shaky ground when the restaurant opened in the early 2000s. But the Wilmington location is now one of 13 locations for the brewery in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey – and among its busiest. New hotels will keep up the momentum, he said.\n\n“If it’s 122 rooms, it will be at least 122 people who need to eat and go out,” he said of the Riverfront Hotel LLC project.\n\nIron Hill often has consultants and business associates visit for meetings, he said. Usually, the customers try to stay at the Westin first, he said, but it’s “not cheap” – a one-night, one-room stay on May 6 would cost $142 – and reservations aren’t always available.\n\n“If you don’t book a few weeks in advance, it’s hard to get a room at that hotel,” he said.\n\nThe addition of more hotel rooms also could bring even more attractions. And that, McGlichey said, could help the Riverfront lure more employers, such as AAA Mid-Atlantic, Barclay's and Navient.\n\n\"Corporations are always looking for ways to attract talent,\" she said. \"If you have an exciting, vibrant place for them, you're going to see more of them want to come here.\"\n\nThe fact that more hotels may be built at the Riverfront is proof of the growing energy there, Navient spokeswoman Nikki A. Lavoie said. That nation's largest servicer of student loans moved its national headquarters to the Riverfront in 2015.\n\n“It tells us the investment we made here two years ago was worthwhile because the area continues to grow,” she said. “We’d be really happy to welcome a new hotel as our neighbor.”\n\nNot everyone happy\n\nWhile the Riverfront might be cheering the addition of hotels, the added rooms are being looked at with some skepticism by some hoteliers.\n\nThe Delaware Hotel and Lodging Association has been warning for years that an influx of new properties throughout the state is threatening to undermine the local industry's recovery, just as it is finally getting underway.\n\nStatewide occupancy rates returned to pre-recession levels for the first time in 2014. In 2016, those rates improved to 55 percent – still below the 60 percent break-even point for most hotels, and well south of 68 percent national average. Hotel managers say that's because a growing number of developers and hospitality chains are opening new properties every year – flooding the market with supply that outpaces demand.\n\nThe trend is even more pronounced in Wilmington, which draws most of its business from legal and corporate industries. With several banks narrowing their workforces and the DuPont Co.'s 2015 move to the suburbs, some of the four major hotels in downtown Wilmington have struggled to fill the 780 rooms among them.\n\nCompetition is expected to get even fiercer this fall when Canon Hospitality Management is slated to open a 96-room Marriott Residence Inn in the formerly vacant Beneficial Bank building at 1300 N. Market St. Soon after, BPG will begin renovating the Hotel du Pont as part of a $175 million transformation of the DuPont Building, which also includes Chemours headquarters and the Playhouse on Rodney Square.\n\nAdd in the three new hotels planned on the Riverfront, and Wilmington soon could see its overall inventory of hotel rooms jump 40 percent.\n\n\"It probably will affect my business if all three of those projects get built,\" said Canon Patel, president Canon Hospitality Management. \"I think everyone is going to have to work on their branding, marketing strategy, and revenue management. But at the end of the day, it's going to come down to who can offer the best value proposition.\"\n\nGreg Pettinaro, CEO of the family real estate company that developed several of the commercial properties on the Riverfront, said that's a battle the new hotels are likely to win.\n\n\"If I were coming from out of town, I would much rather stay on the Riverfront than downtown,\" he said. \"You've got restaurants, movies, a 1.5-mile walking trail along the river, a nature preserve and free parking down there. Why wouldn't you chose to stay there?\"\n\nNot everyone is convinced the new hotels will harm the downtown properties, however. Bill Silva, general manager of the Westin and chairman of the state hotel association, said competition is good for everyone.\n\n\"It's going to force us all to deliver better service and provide more opportunities for people,\" he said. \"Besides, we're still only talking about 1,200 or so rooms in the entire city. The Philadelphia Marriott has more rooms than that all by itself and they're doing fine.\"\n\nMcGlinchey said the new hotels would be generating new business by drawing from larger conventions at the Chase Center –– not from the existing market.\n\nPurzycki, meanwhile, said it’s “hard to tell” if the additional properties will lead to over saturation.\n\n“It may hurt another vendor or operator. We just don’t know,” he said. “[But] these guys are not fools. There are no novices here.\"\n\nNew kids on the block\n\nThe 122-room hotel planned next to Big Fish Grill will be a new undertaking for both partners in the Riverfront Hotel development team. Big Fish Restaurant Group operates eateries throughout the region but has never undertaken a hotel development project.\n\nAnd the 30-year-old Onix Group – which owns six hotels, including a 96-room Comfort Inn in Rehoboth Beach – has never done a project in Wilmington. Onix also owns or is developing commercial facilities, such as the Pike Creek Medical Office Condominiums off Limestone Road, the Dover Towne Center in Kent County and a 90-bed behavioral hospital in Georgetown.\n\nTogether, the two partners make a perfect team, said Sugrue, who heads Big Fish.\n\n\"I think we're combining what we're both good at to make something great that neither of us could have accomplished on our own,\" he said.\n\nThe envisioned project will include a one-story, 12,000-square-foot connector with a 4,300-square-foot banquet hall that will run from the kitchen of Big Fish Grill south to an 83-foot-tall hotel topped by a bridal suite. Most of the rooms will feature unobstructed views of the Christina River and the Wilmington skyline. The new property also will include an outdoor patio along the Riverwalk path that traces the Christina's western bank.\n\nBig Fish will operate the banquet hall, while Onix Group will manage the hotel. The project is expected to employ 60 workers. Construction would create 175 jobs.\n\n\"We're looking to market to the mid-priced leisure and business traveler,\" said Jonathan Silver, the Onix Group's director of real estate. \"We think our hotel will be a nice compliment to the Westin, which is a different price point. There's a demand here for that kind of modern, affordable accommodation.\"\n\nRob Buccini said he welcomes the competition but adds that he would prefer a \"higher-end brand.\"\n\n\"I think the Riverfront is big enough for both of us,\" he said. \"For us to keep building the momentum in Wilmington, there definitely needs to be other developers focused on the city along with us.\"\n\nDeveloper Louis Capano III also is heeding that call with his first foray into the city. Louis Capano & Sons recently began work on a 68-unit, multifamily apartment building at 101 Avenue of the Arts, next to the Gates Building, which houses Barclay's and FireStone Roasting House. That four-story project is slated to be followed by an eight-story structure with 135 apartments.\n\n\"Buccini/Pollin has really spurred a lot of the growth along the river and proven there is high demand among people who want to live there,\" Capano said. \"I think that has encouraged other people like us to invest right alongside them.\"\n\nSilver also praised BPG's contribution to the Riverfront.\n\n\"I have a ton of respect for them and what they've done for this city,\" he said. \"They're as first class as it gets.\"\n\nPurzycki described BPG as “our heroes” for investing more than a $1 billion in the city over the last decade, both along the Riverfront and North Market Street. But, he said, it’s even more encouraging to see fresh blood investing in Wilmington.\n\n“It’s important that we get other investors, other large developers, committing their funds into the city,” he said. “To me, that’s a sign of confidence in the future of the city. That is very healthy for us.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.

and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: An Alabama man says he has completed his quest to mow lawns for veterans in all 50 states. Rodney Smith Jr. tweeted Friday that he was headed home from Hawaii after cutting grass on Oahu. He got to his last state with help from Delta Air Lines. He says he will now continue providing free lawn care to the elderly, disabled, single mothers and veterans in Alabama. Smith was inspired to begin a free yard mowing service in 2015 after seeing an elderly man cutting his lawn. That morphed into a mission to cut grass for service veterans in every U.S. state. Smith drove across the country this spring posting photos of himself with veterans as he cut their lawns. Individual and corporate donations helped pay for hotel rooms and other expenses.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The National Park Service has completed a project to relieve an interspecies traffic jam. A new elevated bridge and boardwalk across the Brooks River in Katmai National Park and Preserve has replaced a river-level bridge that was often closed to human tourists because it was occupied by locals – brown bears. The replacement for the old floating bridge was more than a decade in the making. Bears catching salmon are a huge draw for the park on the Alaska Peninsula, the arm of land extending from Alaska’s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. The park service estimates 2,200 brown bears inhabit the park, a number exceeding the people who live on the peninsula. The new bridge, which cost $5.6 million, features bear-proof gates on both ends.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A philanthropic arm of Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation has offered to provide legal support for a couple who say police used excessive force and threatened to shoot them in an incident caught on video. Dravon Ames, 22, and his pregnant fiancee, Aisha Harper, 24, were pulled over by Phoenix police May 29. They allege police pointed a gun at their children, threatened them, and physically harmed Ames and their daughter because the child took a doll from a dollar store. The couple is demanding $10 million from the city of Phoenix. A notice of claim filed Thursday says the police officers committed battery, unlawful imprisonment, false arrest and infliction of emotional distress in addition to violating their civil rights. Team ROC has secured high-profile attorney Alex Spiro to join the family’s legal team pro-bono.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Long before she became the spokeswoman for the Trump administration, Sarah Huckabee Sanders was a well-known figure in the Natural State who appeared in campaign ads for her dad, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, and learned about the state’s rough-and-tumble politics by working on his campaign and others. Now, speculation that Sanders may run for governor in her home state shakes up a race that’s three years away but was already expected to be a crowded and expensive fight among Republicans. Trump announced Thursday that Sanders was leaving as White House press secretary and encouraged her to run for Arkansas governor, a job her dad held for 10 1/ 2 years. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson was re-elected in November, and the seat will open up in 2022 when he’s barred by term limits from running again.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: High school graduation speeches are usually full of praise for teachers and officials. So it was more than a little unusual when a valedictorian sarcastically thanked them for making her self-sufficient by doing nothing to help her. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports San Ysidro High senior Nataly Buhr initially thanked parents, friends and some teachers. Then she thanked a school counselor for teaching her to fend for herself by never being available and the main office staff for not informing her of scholarships until a day before the deadline. Buhr also thanked a teacher she said was regularly intoxicated for being an example of “the dangers of alcoholism.” The district says Buhr’s speech didn’t follow her pre-approved version and was inappropriate. But Buhr’s mother said she couldn’t be prouder.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two decades after the name “Columbine” became synonymous with a school shooting, the suburban Denver community surrounding the school is debating whether it’s time to tear down a building that also became a beacon for people obsessed with the killings. School officials say the number of people trying to get close to or even inside the school reached record levels this year, the 20th anniversary of the 1999 attack that killed 13 people. People try to peek into the windows of the school library, mistaking it for the long-demolished room where most of the victims died, or ask people on campus how to take a tour. The buses full of tourists have mostly stopped over the years, but not the visitors. This year alone, security staff contacted more than 2,400 “unauthorized” people on Columbine’s campus.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Officials are kicking off an effort to encourage students graduating from high schools and others to consider attending one of the state’s 12 community colleges. The first in a series of events this summer will be held Monday at 11 a.m. at the Prince Technical High School in Hartford. The summer enrollment campaign is being dubbed “Aspire” and is focusing on those who may not have considered a post-secondary education. Admissions staff from Manchester and Capital Community Colleges will be on hand to talk to any interested potential students. In May, the Connecticut Board of Regents eliminated the application fee for Connecticut’s community colleges. Various officials will be on hand for Monday’s event, including Democratic U.S. Rep. John Larson and Connecticut State Colleges and Universities President Mark Ojakian.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As a guest on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Friday, actress and Wilmington native Aubrey Plaza joined Colbert for a segment called “Community Calendar,” in which the duo detailed and poked fun at events happening near the city. The show rolled a montage of local sites including the Caesar Rodney statue and the Rockford Tower. “You know what we say in Wilmington – it’s a Wilming-ton of fun,” Plaza said. “Oh, I’m Del-aware of that,” Colbert retorted. The two ran through a list of events including the Wilmington Pirate Festival on June 29 and the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center’s FatherFest on June 16. The description of Sunday’s FatherFest promised classic cars, motorcycles and a beer garden. “So stop by and see what happens when you mix vehicles, alcohol and middle-aged despair,” Plaza deadpanned.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The top economic official for the city is leaving his post to join Amazon. The Washington Post reports Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office announced the impending departure of Brian Kenner on Thursday. Kenner is the deputy mayor for planning and economic development and has been a part of the mayor’s Cabinet since she took office in 2015. He’s set to leave his District of Columbia role next month. The mayor will then appoint someone on an interim basis. Kenner previously worked to incentivize Amazon to build its second headquarters in the district. The online behemoth instead chose Arlington County, Virginia. Kenner told The Washington Business Journal that Amazon approached him about a month ago. He says he’ll work in the company’s D.C.-based policy shop.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A South Carolina woman has reached the Florida Keys, completing a 2,575-mile walk to give attention to the opioid overdose crisis. Jessie Grieb finished her East Coast Overdose Awareness Walk on Friday at Key West’s Southernmost Point in the Continental U.S. marker. Friday marked the fourth anniversary of her brother Brian’s death by accidental overdose. Grieb’s boyfriend succumbed to heroin, and she has struggled herself with addiction since she was 17. The Pawleys Island resident started her journey in Fort Kent, Maine, on July 28, 2018, after she had suffered a relapse. To help carry supplies, Grieb pushed a small cart named “Lieutenant Dan” in honor of the “Forrest Gump” character who dealt with addiction in the movie.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Grammy-nominated rapper 21 Savage has given $25,000 to the Southern Poverty Law Center after the watchdog organization helped him while he was in federal immigration custody earlier this year. The rapper, whose real name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested Feb. 3 in what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said was a targeted operation over his expired visa. Abraham-Joseph is a British citizen and moved to the U.S. when he was 7. In a statement, immigration attorney Charles Kuck said the Atlanta-based rapper wants to support the work the SPLC has done to give immigrants legal representation and fight what Kuck called ICE’s “oppressively adverse conditions of detention.” The rapper spent 10 days at the Irwin County Detention Center before he was released on a $100,000 bond.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man injured during a rockfall in a state park was among five people cited for trespassing, officials say. State officials cited Lincoln Hittner of Honolulu for trespassing in a closed park, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Hittner was treated for minor injuries by Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers in Sacred Falls State Park, officials say. Hittner described his near-miss with the rockfall as “15 seconds of terror,” officials say. He was among a group of six that included Hawaii residents and a visiting Australian who all received citations, authorities say. Sacred Falls State Park has been closed and warning signs posted since a 1999 accident left eight people dead and dozens hurt, officials say. The state has extensively publicized the dangers of entering closed areas, including a video about Sacred Falls, according to the Department of Land and Natural Resources.\n\nIdaho\n\nPreston: The cult comedy “Napoleon Dynamite” turns 15 years old this month, a milestone for a movie filmed in the Gem State that became an early breakaway hit in today’s era of pop-culture geek celebration. The movie that created the “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt and made Napoleon’s disgusted exclamation of “gosh!” into a 2004 catchphrase is celebrating its anniversary this month. Made for just $400,000 in and around Franklin County, it would ultimately gross over $46 million as a word-of-mouth hit before social media took off. The movie told the story of its socially awkward title character, who ultimately triumphed because of his quirks rather than in spite of them. Its success added to a rising profile for unapologetic nerds just before hits like “The Big Bang Theory” ushered in a new era of geek glory.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Some endangered birds could ground a beachfront music festival proposed for late August. Promoters of Mamby on the Beach are seeking a permit from the Chicago Park District to move the show to Montrose Beach on the city’s north side. But two piping plovers lately have been making the beach their home. Four eggs were discovered and turned over to the Lincoln Park Zoo last week. The plovers appear to be making a new nest, said Louise Clemency of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MAMBY on the Beach is scheduled to take place Aug. 23-24 and expected to draw up to 20,000 people to the Lake Michigan lakefront each day. But Jill Niland of the Montrose Lakefront Coalition says there are concerns about the number of people expected to attend and noise pollution that could disrupt the piping plovers. The small shorebird is on state endangered species lists and listed as threatened at the federal level.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A change state lawmakers made this year to a tax incentive for startups is being hailed as a big win for the tech industry because it promises to make it easier for fledgling businesses to attract out-of-state investors. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports that legislation signed by Gov. Eric Holcomb will allow investors to transfer Indiana’s Venture Capital Investment tax credits, starting next year. Transferring the credits will allow out-of-state investors to essentially sell them to someone in the state who can take advantage. Tech community leaders say the change will encourage out-of-state individuals to invest in Indiana startups. The state’s VCI tax credit program allows someone who invests in an Indiana startup to claim a tax credit worth 20% of the investment. The credit is capped at $1 million.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Torrential rain this spring prevented most Midwest farmers from planting their crops, but while the federal government provides help to growers of corn and soybeans, those who grow so-called specialty crops are largely on their own. Although the lack of federal safety net programs for farmers who grow everything from arugula to zucchini isn’t new, one of the wettest springs in U.S. history has focused attention on the special status of commodity crops, primarily corn, soybeans, cotton, rice and wheat. Iowa organic farmer Andrew Dunham shrugs at the situation, noting that “there are no federal bailouts for vegetable farmers.” Iowa State University economist Chad Hart says crops like corn and soybeans are treated differently because they’re so important to the national economy, and shortages would be painful, particularly to the livestock industry.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Two endangered Mexican wolf pups from a Kansas zoo have been released into the wild in Arizona. The Wichita Eagle reports that a male puppy, named Traveler, and a female puppy, named Jaunt, were born at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita. They were 2 weeks old last month when they were placed with a litter whose mother is wild. Mexican wolves are considered critically endangered, with fewer than 150 members of the species remaining in the wild. They are native to the southwestern United States in Arizona and New Mexico, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will remotely observe the pack to monitor the results of the cross-fostering. But senior zookeeper Nancy Smith says the pack seems to be doing well.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Louisville Zoo has narrowed a naming competition for its new bongo calf down to three characters from the beloved Marvel masterpiece “Guardians of the Galaxy”: Drax, Groot and Rocket. Until June 23, zoo visitors can make a donation to choose their favorite name. There will be a naming kiosk with three slots in the plaza to the right near the zoo’s entrance. The calf will be given the name that receives the most donations, to be announced during the week of June 24. All donations in the competition will go to the zoo’s conservation efforts. Bongos are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species and are listed as a “near threatened” species. The future Drax, Groot or Rocket is on exhibit along with his mother and the other bongos.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state court official has agreed to take steps to make sure defendants in criminal cases aren’t jailed because they cannot afford bail. The agreement is detailed in a federal court order filed Thursday involving Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell and plaintiffs who accused Cantrell of violating an earlier federal judgment regarding low-income defendants. As a magistrate judge in the criminal district court in New Orleans, Cantrell sets bail for people arrested on various state charges. The agreement details requirements for determining whether a defendant can afford bail and whether the defendant is a flight risk or poses a danger when alternatives to bail are considered. U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon issued Thursday’s order detailing the agreement and closing the case against Cantrell.\n\nMaine\n\nDover-Foxcroft: Police say a moose smashed through the window of a vacant pizzeria. Piscataquis County corrections officer Matt Poole snapped a photo of the moose stepping through broken glass onto East Main Street early Friday. The Dover-Foxcroft Police Department posted on Facebook, “We found the suspect and they are not in custody. Boring right?” Maine has plenty of moose, and sometimes they wander into towns. But Police Chief Ryan Reardon says it was the first time in 26 years he’d seen one run into a building. State biologists estimate Maine’s moose population is between 50,000 and 70,000.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Museum of Art has so far this year added more than 70 contemporary and historic artworks to its broad collection. BMA director Christopher Bedford said in a statement that the new acquisitions highlight the curatorial team’s vision in forging connections “across artists and movements within the museum’s collection.” Additions include 19th-century prints by Italian art nouveau illustrator Manuel Orazi, a film by Cuban American artist Ana Mendieta and a painting by contemporary American artist Mary Lovelace O’Neal. Various new pieces were purchased with proceeds from last year’s auction of seven works by 20th-century artists, including Andy Warhol, to help diversify and contemporize its collection. The BMA has nearly 100,000 pieces, including the world’s largest holding of Henri Matisse’s creations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bit of seat belt art is part of a new public information campaign aimed at getting young men to buckle up when they’re behind the wheel. State officials say they commissioned teens through Artists for Humanity to create a free-standing art installation that will help deliver the message that seat belts can save lives. The 6-foot-by-12-foot artwork is wrapped with real seat belts and will be displayed at locations around the state during the summer. The new campaign is called “Love Clicks” and is based on research that suggests young men are more likely to use seat belts if someone they love asks them to do so. Data suggests that while seat belt use is increasing in Massachusetts, men still buckle up at a lower rate than women.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pride flags are flying on the state office building for the first time in Michigan’s history. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered that starting Saturday, two of the iconic rainbow flags will fly on the George W. Romney Building to help celebrate June as Pride Month in Michigan. The flying of the flags comes after Whitmer signed a proclamation designating June as Pride Month to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City. A police raid on a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn triggered a series of riots and sparked the nascent LGBT movement in the country and around the world. In a news release, Whitmer said celebrating Pride Month helps ensure that members of Michigan’s LGBTQ community “are treated with the respect they deserve.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota regents have voted to allow beer and wine sales in the general seating sections of the school’s basketball and hockey arenas. Friday’s vote was unanimous and comes as the school is trying to drive up revenue at sporting events. The university has been dropping some ticket prices in response to declining attendance. The Star Tribune reports that athletic director Mark Coyle told regents that campus police back the expanded alcohol sales, as does a fan advisory council. TCF Bank Stadium expanded alcohol sales to general seating areas in 2012. Overall alcohol revenue at the football stadium has been about $1.3 million annually, with most of that coming from general seating, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: Five more members have been added to a hall of fame that honors the arts and entertainment in the Magnolia State. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience announced the additions Thursday of four musicians and one literary figure. Country singer Tammy Wynette of Tremont was lauded as the first lady of country music. Singer and guitarist Bo Diddley helped bridge the blues and rock ’n’ roll. Pianist and singer Jerry Lee Lewis is one of the last surviving pioneers of rock ’n’ roll. Margaret Walker Alexander was a poet, novelist and Jackson State University literature professor. John Lee Hooker was a blues guitarist and five-time Grammy Award winner. The new designees join 23 existing members. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience in Meridian includes exhibits, performance spaces and a recording studio.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A bar that served as a set location for the movie “Gone Girl” will reopen later this month. The Southeast Missourian reports that The Bar in downtown Cape Girardeau had been closed since last fall. Representative for the management company that owns it and several other downtown properties say the establishment will resume serving drinks June 27. Formerly a catering business, the corner site was transformed into The Bar for the 2014 film “Gone Girl” starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. After the movie was released, the set was converted into a real restaurant and bar. General manager Derek Vaughn says it will no longer serve food and will only be open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 4 p.m. until 1:30 a.m.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers did not have enough support to override four vetoes by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Poll results released Friday showed lawmakers did not reach the two-thirds majority needed in the state House and the Senate to override vetoes on a bill that would have given health insurers the ability to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, two bills that would have created tax breaks and a campus free-speech bill. Bullock vetoed a bill proposed by Republican State Auditor Matt Rosendale that sought to lower prescription drug prices by requiring pharmacy benefit managers to pass on drug manufacturer rebates to insurers. Bullock said the proposal would actually increase costs. In total, lawmakers voted 108-40 in favor of Rosendale’s bill during the session, but the override effort fell short by five votes in each chamber.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Visitors to six state recreation areas will be allowed to light off fireworks July 4. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says those recreation areas are Branched Oak near Malcolm, Fort Kearny near Kearney, Pawnee near Emerald, Wagon Train near Hickman, and those near Memphis and Fremont. Those parks will permit fireworks from 8 a.m. until midnight on July 4 only. Signs at recreation areas will point the way to designated fireworks sites, and their boundaries will be clearly marked. Use of fireworks elsewhere in state areas or at other times is prohibited. Only fireworks approved for sale in Nebraska are permitted, and visitors must pick up expended fireworks and deposit them in appropriate containers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Burning Man won’t be growing this year, but there could be at least one major change upon entry – drug screenings. The Bureau of Land Management on Friday issued the final environmental impact statement for Burning Man, denying the Burning Man organization its sought-after growth to 100,000 people but granting it more time to address a number of environmental and security concerns. The federal agency may, however, hire a private security firm this year to conduct drug screenings. Or it might wait until 2020, according to BLM spokesman Rudy Evenson. As for the growth of the event, the population cap will remain at 80,000 people for the weeklong event held each year over Labor Day weekend in Northern Nevada’s Black Rock Desert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton Falls: Enthusiastic clapping – and some furious flapping – marked the end to the saga of designating an official state raptor. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday signed a bill honoring the red-tailed hawk. As applause broke out, a bird being held just over his shoulder began flapping its wings. The bill was proposed by Hampton Falls fourth graders four years ago, but it was killed after one lawmaker injected the issue of abortion into the debate by saying the hawk’s habit of tearing apart prey “limb from limb” would make it an ideal mascot for Planned Parenthood. The students, now in eighth grade, lobbied for a new bill this year and were successful. Sununu told them they exemplified a lesson in perseverance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A year after gunfire shattered the city’s annual Art All Night festival, hundreds flocked to this year’s celebration of local art, music, food and films – even though, strictly speaking, it no longer quite lived up to the name. The formerly “all night” festival took a break from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday before resuming for the morning and afternoon. And for the first time in the festival’s 13-year history, the event was fenced off, and attendees had to go through security checkpoints before entering the event space that included visible police and security officers. The June 17 shooting last year left a suspect dead and 22 people injured in what authorities said looked like neighborhood gang dispute. But those attending this year to examine the more than 800 pieces of art displayed inside and outside the Roebling Wireworks Building spoke of moving forward rather than looking backward.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state’s film industry appears to be on the brink of a boom thanks to abortion law controversies in other states and expanded incentives. A recent spike in film production in the state comes as Hollywood targets both Georgia and Louisiana over recently passed restrictive abortion laws, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The political developments are being watched closely in New Mexico, which is poised to benefit even though state officials have said there’s no organized campaign to lure film productions from those states. The jump also comes as New Mexico is set to more than double its annual state spending cap on film incentives. In addition, NBCUniversal announced Friday it will build a television and film studio in a warehouse district just north of downtown Albuquerque as it seeks to expand its footprint in one of the fastest-growing film production hubs in the country.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City police say a 29-year-old officer died Friday in the department’s third suspected suicide in less than two weeks. Police say he shot himself in the head on a Staten Island street near the 121st Precinct to which the officer was assigned. His identity had not been released as of late Friday. The week before, two longtime officers died in suspected suicides within 24 hours of each other. Deputy Chief Steven Silks was found dead in a police vehicle in Queens on June 5. Detective Joseph Calabrese was found the next day at a Brooklyn beach. Police say both died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. In the wake of the deaths, Commissioner James O’Neill sent a note reminding the more than 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians in the NYPD that help is available if they’re feeling depressed, hopeless or otherwise contemplating self-harm.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state won’t clear voting-machine makers to sell their systems to county elections boards until it learns more about who owns them, the elections board chairman said Friday. The decision comes amid worries of foreign election interference that have grown since special counsel Robert Mueller’s April report into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election. Mueller’s report “essentially says everybody should be concerned about this, and everybody should be looking harder at a lot of these things to make sure we’re protected as best we can be,” said Robert Cordle, the head of the state elections board. “It’s just a matter of doing our due diligence now.” The state board is giving the three companies that have already passed several rounds of screening until Friday to disclose anyone holding a 5% or greater interest in their company, their parent company or any subsidiaries.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota plans to acquire the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House’s property in Bismarck and turn the facility into affordable housing. Lutheran Social Services is partnering with CommunityWorks North Dakota on the acquisition. The plan is to take over the facility by the end of summer. The sale of the site is “in the works,” Lutheran Social Services CEO Jessica Thomasson told The Bismarck Tribune. Choice Bank took ownership of the facility last month. “The reason we got involved was to try to preserve these 85 units of affordable housing in Bismarck because it’s hard when a community loses an asset like that to ever get it back,” Thomasson said. She said the plans include retaining the 85 apartments, renovating some of the units and common areas, and turning underutilized space into 20 additional apartments.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Farmer Jay Butterfield survived a harrowing afternoon recently after being buried up to his neck inside a soybean bin. The 70-year-old was trying to break up wet clumps of the crop inside a 30-foot-tall bin when he sank up to his knees. The material along the bin’s sides began to engulf him. Within 15 minutes, Butterfield was buried up to his neck and thought he was probably going to die. The three-hour rescue effort on the farm north of Cincinnati involved 52 first responders from a dozen departments. Butterfield acknowledges he’s a lucky man. Last year, 30 people were buried in grain on farms, and half died. Butterfield’s friend Charlie Groh died in a corn bin in 2013 in a neighboring township. It happens so often, in fact, that fire departments in farming regions undergo special training and acquire equipment just for these situations.\n\nOklahoma\n\nConcho: Families and friends of missing or slain American Indian women and girls are again calling for justice for their loved ones. About 200 people gathered Friday near the headquarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Concho. Many wore red and marched, holding signs with pictures of women on them. Similar demonstrations have taken place in other states amid growing concern that police nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women and girls. Those demographic groups have some of the nation’s highest rates of sexual and domestic violence. Kateri Fletcher, a Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal government official who helped organize the event, said it was designed to bring awareness and show support for families who still need answers.\n\nOregon\n\nAurora: A global hemp research lab in the state is part of a larger movement to bring the standardization to hemp that traditional crops like corn and cotton enjoy. It’s a critical step toward accountability and consistency in an industry that’s sprung up almost overnight since the U.S. legalized hemp last year. The Global Hemp Innovation Center was unveiled recently by Oregon State University and will be the largest such research hub in the U.S. Oregon State will also begin certifying hemp seeds so that farmers can be confident they’re getting quality seeds. A national review board for hemp varieties is also getting up and running. Interest in the cannabis crop has exploded because of hemp-derived CBD, a compound marketed as having health benefits but without the high caused by marijuana.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBloomsburg: For the past 15 years, Bloomsburg University students have been quietly stocking the shelves of a town food cupboard, donating more than a ton of food and more than $15,000 in meal-plan funds each year. With the help of those donations, volunteers at the Bloomsburg Food Cupboard have been able to bag breakfast, lunch and snacks for elementary students from poor families to take home each weekend, says cupboard director Martha Sheehe. University students who have meal plan “FLEX” money left in their accounts at the end of the academic year can either spend it down or donate it, says Tom McGuire, director of media relations at BU. Sometimes students will buy cases of water or soda to drain their accounts, but many donate their remaining cash to ARAMARK, the university’s dining service, which then purchases food to fill the elementary students’ “Panther Packs.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has preserved 43 acres of open space to provide more recreational opportunities. The Department of Environmental Management says it’s using about $250,000 provided through open space bonds to permanently protect forested land in Charlestown for public recreational access. DEM Director Janet Coit says she’s delighted to secure this valuable parcel and encouraged residents to explore it. The property abuts DEM’s Burlingame Management Area. That area, with the adjoining Burlingame State Park, encompasses more than 4,000 contiguous acres of protected land that’s managed for public recreation, including fishing, hunting and camping. The department purchased the property from private landowners and, at their request, granted a conservation easement to the Charlestown Land Trust to increase the level of protection on the property.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSummerville: A mapping error from 1897 is causing 21st-century headaches for people living near Charleston. Surveyors 122 years ago messed up drawing the county line between Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports the mistake was officially corrected last year, leaving an apartment complex and a senior living home split between the two counties. State officials have been working for a decade to precisely map county boundaries. Tenants at the Farmington Village Apartments are told that the unit they select will decide whether their children go to schools in Berkeley County or Dorchester County. The Village at Summerville senior living complex is split, too, but has arranged to have Dorchester County Emergency Medical Service answer all of its calls. The redrawn boundary has changed tax bills too.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A business development center that was launched more than a decade ago on the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology campus is coming out of the shadows. The Rapid City Journal reports that the Ascent Innovation Center, which opened in a remote corner of the campus in 2006, has outgrown its space and is poised to expand to a more visible location, in downtown Rapid City. School officials say construction on the $12 million business incubator could begin this summer, thanks in part to a $3 million federal grant that puts the new center in range of being fully funded. The architect of the project is Wisconsin-based Strang Inc., which specializes in design of innovation centers and research parks. The building is slated for completion in late 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Peanuts, cracker jacks, hot dogs ... mayonnaise? One fan added a weird twist to baseball stadium cuisine when he started eating from a mayonnaise jar during the Memphis Redbirds’ 8-4 loss to the Las Vegas Aviators at AutoZone Park on Saturday. He started eating early in the game, and by the fourth inning he moved to a different seat and continued eating from the jar with a spoon before security had him moved to another seat. That didn’t stop the mayo eater as he found a new place and continued eating it in the fifth inning. The Redbirds’ Twitter account kept a running commentary, as insiders were apparently as shocked and confused as fans watching it on social media. Even Minor League Baseball’s Twitter account got wind of the fan’s snack and tweeted further disgust.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The groups behind an innovative way of rebuilding homes after a natural disaster say their approach will save money and get people into housing more quickly. They’re hoping a bill signed last week by Gov. Greg Abbott related to disaster planning will boost their efforts. The housing program known as Rapido, Spanish for fast, debuted its first such home built in Houston last week. Under the program, a core unit made up of pre-built panels is assembled. A family lives in this core while the rest of the house is built around them. The Texas agency that has handled housing recovery following Hurricane Harvey in 2017 says it supports such innovations but says rule changes would be needed to free up federal funding to support such ideas.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: When John Frey’s family requested 101 birthday cards to celebrate the World War II veteran’s 101st birthday in Utah, they were expecting to get 500 at most. At a celebration June 8, a day after his birthday, Frey ended up with well over 5,000 cards, the Daily Herald reports. According to the report, Frey’s request spread quickly after the Associated Press picked up the story from the Daily Herald in May and it appeared in news outlets across the country. The cards came from all 50 states and at least 12 countries. Entire classrooms of children, military veterans and Utah’s elected officials wanted to wish the former mechanic/machinist for the U.S. Army a happy birthday. Frey said he had not expected to ever get so many cards.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: U.S. production of maple syrup increased slightly this year, even though the season was shorter than last year’s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that the country produced 4.2 million gallons of the pancake topper, up 1% from 2018. Leading producer Vermont made more than 2 million gallons, an increase over 2018. Data shows Vermont was followed by New York, Maine and Wisconsin. The USDA says the earliest sap flow reported was Jan. 5 in New York. The season lasted an average of 30 days in syrup-producing states, compared with 42 last year. Amanda Voyer, of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, says the conditions made for some strong days of sap flow in trees.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Attorney General Mark Herring is calling for the legalization of marijuana. Herring said Saturday that Virginia should start decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and eventually legalize the drug. The Democratic attorney general said criminal prosecutions are costly to the state and local governments and disproportionately affect African Americans. Herring made the remarks in an op-ed in the Daily Press and in comments to reporters at a Democratic fundraiser in Richmond. Herring’s announcement won’t have any practical impact on marijuana prosecutions, which are typically handled at the local level. But Herring said he hopes his public support for legalization will help spur lawmakers to act. The Republican-controlled General Assembly has killed past efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: A Christian organization has fired a teenager from his job as a camp counselor because he is gay. The Bellingham Herald reports Jace Taylor says he was terminated Tuesday after being hired last month by THE FIRS to be a Fir Creek camp counselor. The nondenominational Christian organization confirmed that Taylor’s sexual orientation was the reason for his firing. Executive Director Tom Beaumont says when it became evident that Taylor didn’t personally align with the group’s statements of faith, it determined it could not use him in the role. Under state law, an employer cannot discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation. QLaw Foundation executive director Denise Diskin says religious nonprofit employers are not defined as employers under the law. Taylor says he intends to picket on the first day of camp to inform people there of the situation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRoanoke: Students participating in the state’s new program for free tuition at public community colleges will have to pass a drug test that includes marijuana. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board of the West Virginia Community and Technical College System listened to a presentation Thursday from a consultant helping launch the program. Kathy Butler said the testing will include the marijuana component THC as well as opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and other drugs. Butler said the testing is modeled after that used by WorkForce West Virginia, a state job placement and training organization. Students will be required to pass the drug test within 60 days of the start of a semester to receive free tuition for that semester. The policy does allow exemptions for legally prescribed medicines.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Hiring in the restaurant and hotel industry is difficult right now. More than 4,000 positions in the area are advertised on one of the largest job sites, Indeed. Hospitality businesses in the city say they don’t have enough workers ready to serve the tens of thousands of people who will come to town for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. At the same time, Milwaukee has large segments of its population that are unemployed and could benefit from work in the service industry. “It’s ships passing in the night – people looking for employees and the people looking for jobs,” Mayor Tom Barrett says. Business and city leaders are starting to make plans for how to use the DNC to establish a pipeline for workers to enter the service industry –a resource that would exist after the convention leaves.\n\nWyoming\n\nRiverton: Students at a high school here will be able to take classes on the Northern Arapaho language. The Riverton Ranger reports that the Fremont County School District 25 Board of Trustees has approved offering two courses of the language at Riverton High School. Riverton Principal John Griffith says parents and students have been suggesting the idea for years in the district near the Wind River Reservation. He says the school now has a staff member with a desire to teach the language. The first class will acquaint students with the basic sounds of the Arapaho language. They also will learn the Arapaho alphabet. In the second class, students will use the basic sounds to form Arapaho words and phrases in order to have conversations or tell short stories.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}]}

I'm also going to be joining them on getting the vote out.\"\n\nThe rally was sponsored by Citizens for Judicial Fairness, an organization backed by global translation services company TransPerfect and its employees. Philip Shawe, co-founder of TransPerfect, and the company's employees have been criticizing Delaware officials since a Chancery Court ruling led to the sale of the business in 2014. Shawe subsequently regained control of the company in 2018.\n\nLocal leaders show support for activists\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Carney officially announced he is running for mayor of Wilmington. In his announcement, he pledged to work with state officials, school districts and community leaders to improve public education in city schools and invest in small and minority-owned businesses.\n\nAmong those present at the rally were elected officials and political candidates whom McDole said she could count on to be responsive. This included New Castle County Executive and governor candidate Matt Meyer; state Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker and lieutenant governor candidate; former Wilmington City Treasurer Velda Jones-Potter, candidate for mayor; and Collin O’Mara, former Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary and Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nWith several political candidates surrounding her, McDole said she wants to secure enough votes to alter the composition of the courts, their jury pools and the leadership of Wilmington.\n\n\"Not only will voter registration help with putting in people like us in the court systems and throughout, it will also have [it so] we can sit on the jury,\" she said.\n\nYou can contact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/12/01/perlman-kissin-maisky-perform/76635010/", "title": "Itzhak Perlman trio sells out The Grand in Wilmington", "text": "The News Journal\n\nWorld-renowned violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Evgeny Kissin and cellist Mischa Maisky stopped at The Grand Opera House to perform in Copeland Hall Tuesday night.\n\nThe all-star trio premiered their rare concert performance at The Grand before heading to New York’s legendary Carnegie Hall for a Thursday night concert.

Market St. restaurant celebrates over-the-top burgers, shakes made with cereal and a wide selection of bourbon.\n\nAt the restaurant, Fieri apparently samples pork piled onto a burger patty and the restaurant's chicken skins.\n\nFarmer & The Cow has several burgers with pork including the \"Morning Glory\" ($16) that has both bacon and scrapple and the \"That'll Do Pig\" ($18) with bacon, bacon jam and bacon mayonnaise.

A service will be held in Georgetown Saturday morning, followed by interment in Nicaragua at a later date, the obituary states.\n\nArauz’s death follows more than a dozen worker safety violations at the Harbeson-area plant over the last several years, as outlined by citations issued by OSHA.\n\nThat includes an incident last year in which a worker lost a finger at the plant.\n\nBoth serious injuries come on the heels of a lengthy reprimand to the plant’s operators in 2015, in which OSHA said Allen Harim was failing to properly report injuries, that its facility lacked proper medical oversight and that “the medical management practices at this facility create an environment of fear and distrust.”\n\nOSHA also found that, in some cases, employees had to wait up to 40 minutes to use the bathroom and that conditions at the plant “were causing or likely to cause serious physical harm to employees” due to the repetitive motions and hard labor required in a chicken processing plant.\n\nThose conditions, which OSHA said were exacerbated by a lack of proper equipment, were likely leading to “musculoskeletal disorders including, but not limited to, tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger thumb and shoulder pain.”\n\nOSHA proposed $38,000 in penalties for those violations, which the company challenged. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Labor, Allen Harim and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 27 entered into a formal settlement that requires the company to address the worker safety violations by upgrading equipment and training and other “abatement” measures.\n\nAllen Harim also agreed to pay a $13,000 penalty – one-third of what was originally proposed. The settlement also includes a nonadmission of guilt for the allegations outlined in OSHA’s citations.\n\nRepresentatives from Allen Harim did not respond to requests for comment. A union representative declined to comment.\n\nJames Fisher, spokesman for the Delmarva Poultry Industry, said “employee safety is of utmost importance to the poultry industry” and said injury and illness rates in this sector are lower than other agricultural industries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, nearly 8,000 injuries are reported by the poultry processing industry nationwide each year, with a slight year-over-year increase in injuries, but a slight decrease in illnesses, from 2014 to 2016.\n\nFisher said the 2016 rate of illness and injury of 4.2 cases per 100 workers represents an 82 percent improvement since 1994. He said more than a dozen of Delmarva’s processing plants, hatcheries and feed mills received recognition from the Joint Industry Safety and Health Council, which is comprised of representatives from other poultry industry councils, for their “records of improving workplace safety” based on injury statistics and other evaluations.\n\nFisher did not comment on the recent fatal accident in Harbeson.\n\nAllen Harim, noted as the nation’s 21st largest poultry producer in previous reporting by The News Journal, employs nearly 1,500 workers at its Harbeson plant. There were more than 18,000 chicken employees in the region in 2017, according to the Delmarva Poultry Industry.\n\nOSHA in the past has cited the company for failing to properly report injuries at its Harbeson plant.\n\nWhile the Oct. 5 death is the only fatal accident reported in recent years related to Delaware’s chicken plants, workers are exposed to dangers in an industrial setting where millions of chickens are slaughtered, deboned, sliced and packaged into the grill-ready chicken breasts and thighs sitting on refrigerated store shelves.\n\nDelaware State Police declined to verify the number of deaths at Delaware chicken plants without a Freedom of Information Act request, but the Division of Forensic Science said there has been only one recorded since 2015. The News Journal is waiting for a response on that FOIA request.\n\nSince that 2015 notice to Allen Harim, OSHA has found several other violations at the plant that federal officials say could be placing employees in harm’s way. Three reported incidents this year, including October's fatality, remain under investigation.\n\nOSHA has six months to complete its investigation of the fatal accident. Delaware State Police said on Wednesday that the case remains under investigation, pending results from the Delaware Division of Forensic Science.\n\nOther poultry plant violations\n\nAllen Harim’s feed mill in Seaford also has been cited by OSHA for worker safety violations in the past. That includes an incident reported in 2013 related to combustible material. Because of the age of the report, the original citation has been archived by OSHA.\n\nMountaire Farms\n\nViolations have been found at Mountaire Farms’ Millsboro-area plant in 2010, 2015 and twice in 2018, while OSHA inspections have found violations at the company’s plant in Selbyville annually since 2015 and at least once in 2011, according to OSHA.\n\nThose citations include allegations similar to those at Allen Harim’s Harbeson plant concerning the risk of serious injury from performing stressful, manual tasks without proper equipment. In 2016, OSHA found that workers cutting and deboning meat also were exposed to conditions likely to result in musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nOSHA has imposed a $30,823 penalty for those violations, which the company contested. Additional violations found in 2016 and 2017 regarding employee exposure to ammonia and phosphoric acid – which carry more than $20,000 in additional penalties – also are being challenged by the company.\n\nCompany spokeswoman Cathy Bassett referred to a recent industry award for worker safety as well as education and training at those facilities but did not directly respond to the violations OSHA inspectors found.\n\n“Safety has always been our number one priority and a very important part of our corporate culture,” she said in an email. “We work closely with OSHA to identify and correct issues before they become a problem.”\n\nPerdue Farms\n\nPerdue Farms also has a history of worker-related dangers. No violations were found at Perdue’s Georgetown plant, according to OSHA records, but the Milford facility has had at least one a year since 2015.\n\nThose violations included serious injuries in 2017. In February, an employee pressure washing a conveyor system got an arm stuck in the conveyor, which ripped the skin off.\n\nEight months later, another employee’s work glove got stuck in a piece of equipment, which crushed three fingers. That injury resulted in the amputation of the employee’s ring and middle fingers down to the first knuckle and the removal of the fingertip of the index finger.\n\nJoe Forsthoffer, director of corporate communications at Perdue, said those injuries were related to what is called the \"lock-out\" or \"tag-out\" process to ensure equipment is turned off before any maintenance or sanitation work begins. He said the company is working with a third party, as part of the OSHA settlement for those violations, to review that process.\n\n\"We regularly audit and assess our plant safety processes to continuously improve workplace safety,\" he said in an email. \"Our Milford plant currently has more than one million safe production hours, and Georgetown is closing on five million, with OSHA incident rates significantly less than those for the manufacturing sector as a whole.\"\n\nSince the first violations at Perdue in 2009, as recorded by OSHA’s enforcement inspections online database, the company has faced less than $100,000 in penalties and only paid a fraction of that amount through formal and informal settlements.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nDELAWARE'S TOP NEWS\n\nWatch: Metallica releases never-seen footage of legendary Delaware concert\n\nDelaware has its day: Newest Navy submarine named in honor of the First State\n\nMan who 'inappropriately touched' teens at Caesar Rodney homecoming game arrested: police", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/02/21/polytechs-stevens-comes-back-strong/23822779/", "title": "Polytech's Kody Stevens comes back strong after injury", "text": "Brad Myers\n\nThe News Journal\n\n\n\n\n\nGEORGETOWN – On Jan. 7, when Kody Stevens' right knee locked up in a match against Caesar Rodney, the Polytech senior thought his wrestling season was over.\n\nBut Stevens underwent surgery, attacked his rehabilitation with fervor and returned by Feb. 3. On Saturday, he won the 126-pound title at the Henlopen Conference Wrestling Championships at Sussex Central.\n\n\"I probably won't be at the level I was before I got hurt,\" Stevens said of his chances going into next week's dual meet and individual state tournaments. \"But just to know that I'm somewhere close to there and still competing for the top spot ... it makes me confident.\"\n\nStevens tore a meniscus in his right knee days before last year's conference meet, but endured the pain and finished second in the Henlopen and third at 120 pounds in the DIAA Individual Wrestling Championships. He underwent surgery to repair the tear in March, and was ready for the Panthers' football season in August.\n\nBut then disaster struck against Caesar Rodney.\n\n\"When we wrestled CR, my knee got locked up and I couldn't bend it because my meniscus got stuck,\" Stevens said. \"The only way for it to bend was for me to have surgery.\"\n\nInstead of being repaired again, which would have required a lengthy recovery, the meniscus was removed this time.\n\n\"When they take it out, it's a lot faster,\" said Stevens, who was one of four Polytech wrestlers to win a conference title Saturday. \"I just have two small cuts in the back of my knee.\"\n\nTop-ranked Smyrna rolled to the team title, piling up 284 points to easily outdistance Polytech (194½), Milford (177) and CR (156½). The Eagles really won it on Friday, when all 14 of their wrestlers reached the semifinals.\n\n\"That says a lot about the balance of our team. I'm really happy about that,\" Eagles coach Kurt Howell said. \"We have a good guy in every weight class.\"\n\nSome of the Smyrna wrestlers who didn't qualify to make the trip likely would have been competitive, too. That depth makes the top-seeded Eagles the favorite to win the Division I title when Smyrna hosts the DIAA Dual Meet championships on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Just in the last week of practice, I had five real emotional and close wrestle-offs that ended up as one-point matches,\" Howell said. \"That's a deep team when you get that. It's a balanced team.\"\n\nSix Smyrna wrestlers reached the finals, with three – Chase Archangelo (113), Ronnie Wuest (170) and Marquelle Bennett (195) claiming Henlopen crowns.\n\nWuest edged Lake Forest's Brian Thomson 3-2 in the Milford Invitational in December, but the rematch was more decisive. Wuest got off to a better start and scored a 9-3 decision this time.\n\n\"He's not in our division, so you wrestle him once or maybe twice a season,\" Wuest said of Thomson. \"He could be practicing just for a moment like this.\n\n\"I was telling myself, 'Go out there and act like you want to dominate the whole match.' I can't just wait until the third period like I always do to rack up points.\"\n\nIn addition to Stevens, Andrew Schmeusser (120), Josh Price (132) and Mark Mullnack (220) won for Polytech. Schmeusser, a senior, met Smyrna sophomore Cole Sebastianelli for the first time in his final and grinded out a 5-0 decision.\n\n\"I was just pushing the pace, keeping the intensity up and trying to control every position,\" Schmeusser said. \"You can watch him, but until you wrestle him you don't really know what he feels like. I had to feel him out.\"\n\nLucas Monson of Woodbridge was named the tournament's outstanding wrestler after edging Sussex Central's Justin Bennett 3-2 in the 152-pound final, the final match of the day. The Blue Raiders also got a title from Tyreq Nelson at 145.\n\nTwo finals were decided by injury default. Cape Henlopen's J.J. Currie and Smyrna's Eli Hutchinson were tied at 2 in the second period at 160 pounds when Hutchinson was injured. CR's Mason Harrington led Milford's Cameron Hayes 6-0 in the third period at 106 when Hayes could no longer continue.\n\nMilford's Bart Dalious (138), CR's Michael Clavier (182) and Dover's Isaiah Abrams (285) also won. The top six finishers in each weight class qualified for the DIAA Individual meet, to be held next Friday and Saturday at Cape Henlopen High. So work remains to be done.\n\n\"It was a good fight. I loved it,\" Abrams said after his tense, 2-1 win over CR's Troy McNally in triple overtime. \"And now it's back to the drawing board on Monday.\"\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

They were expected to at least duplicate their 11 wins and playoff berth from last season. Instead, they lost their first five games and were 1-7 when owner Martha Ford fired general manager Martin Mayhew and team president Tom Lewand. Two assistant coaches were fired as well.\n\nThe Lions then won their next two games, including their first win in Green Bay since 1991. But the offense continues to be inconsistent. Matthew Stafford has thrown 12 interceptions this season. Calvin Johnson continues to be among the elite receivers in the NFL, with 828 yards receiving, which ranks ninth in the NFL. But the running game is last in the NFL, enabling opposing defenses to key on Johnson and Golden Tate.\n\nDefensively, the Lions have improved greatly after struggling to deal with the loss of defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh to free agency and linebacker DeAndre Levy to a season-ending injury. Third-year defensive end Ziggy Ansah has become a force, leading Detroit with eight sacks, fourth in the NFL. Darius Slay has developed into a shutdown cornerback.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nLAST GAME\n\nThe Eagles suffered perhaps their worst loss under Chip Kelly in a 45-17 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was their most lopsided home loss since 2005, when they lost 42-0 to Seattle. The defense was shredded for 521 total yards, including 283 on the ground. It was just as ugly on offense. Mark Sanchez, starting his first game this season in place of Sam Bradford, threw three interceptions. The Lions beat Oakland 18-13 after trailing by three in the fourth quarter. Stafford ran the ball in from the 5 in the fourth quarter for the go-ahead touchdown. Detroit added a safety, then ran out the clock.\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nThe Eagles beat the Lions 34-20 on Dec. 8, 2013 in the famous snow game, when about six inches fell through the first half, completely covering the field. LeSean McCoy ran for 217 yards, including 40-yard and 57-yard touchdowns in the fourth quarter. Chris Polk added a 38-yard touchdown run later in the quarter. The snow helped neutralize the Lions’ passing attack. Calvin Johnson had just three receptions for 49 yards and Matt Stafford completed 10 of 25 passes for 148 yards.\n\nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY\n\n1st down: It appears as if Mark Sanchez will make his second straight start in place of Sam Bradford. The Eagles have to hope that he does a better job of not turning the ball over than he has so far. Sanchez has thrown four interceptions in just 5 ½ quarters of play. Sanchez didn’t get much going after the Eagles’ opening drive, which culminated with Josh Huff’s 39-yard catch and run for a touchdown. Huff never saw the ball again as the Buccaneers played deep and prevented the Eagles from throwing deep. Riley Cooper, Miles Austin and Nelson Agholor combined for five catches for 53 yards.\n\n2nd down: As for the running game, DeMarco Murray will once again get the bulk of the carries as Ryan Mathews will miss his second straight game with a concussion. Murray had just 64 yards on 13 carries against the Bucs. He is averaging just 3.7 yards per carry this season. Darren Sproles and Kenjon Barner will likely get some carries as well. But the Eagles won’t have tight end Zach Ertz, their second leading receiver, who’s out with a concussion. Brent Celek has 213 yards receiving over the past two games. Trey Burton should get some opportunities in place of Ertz.\n\n3rd down: The Eagles rushing defense has dropped from third in the NFL to 28th after allowing an average of 180 yards per game over the last four games. The low point came against the Bucs, who gashed the Eagles for 283 rushing yards. The inside linebackers, considered the strength of the team before the season, seemed especially vulnerable as DeMeco Ryans and Kiko Alonso seemed a step behind Bucs running back Doug Martin. But the Eagles might get a reprieve against the Lions, who come into the game last in the NFL in rushing, averaging just 71.1 yards per game. Then again, the Lions have done better over the last five games, averaging 93.4 rushing yards.\n\n4th down: Like Tampa Bay, the Lions could present the Eagles will plenty of problems at receiver with Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate. Johnson is 6-foot-5 and is having another typically good season despite the constant double teams he faces. The Eagles, no doubt, will have one of their safeties keeping a close eye on Johnson whether he’s matched up against Byron Maxwell or Nolan Carroll. Stafford has played better, too, throwing just three interceptions in the last four games after throwing nine in the first six. The Eagles have been respectable against the pass, but that’s the Lions’ strength as they’re ranked eighth.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n229 … The number of points scored and allowed by the Eagles this season through 10 games, an average of 22.9 points per game. The Eagles averaged 29.6 ppg last season on offense and 25.2 ppg on defense last season.\n\n76 … Number of Thanksgiving Day games hosted by Detroit going back to 1934 (the series was interrupted from 1939-44 during World War II). The Eagles have only played the Lions once on Thanksgiving, in 1968, winning 12-0.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nEagles: Out: RB Ryan Mathews (concussion, groin), TE Zach Ertz (concussion); Questionable: LT Jason Peters (back), QB Sam Bradford (concussion, shoulder), C Jason Kelce (knee).\n\nLions: Questionable: WR Calvin Johnson (ankle), DT Caraun Reid (ankle), CB Darius Slay (neck), DT Gabe Wright (ankle), S Don Carey (back).\n\nTHE RULING ON THE FIELD\n\nThere was so much ugliness about the Eagles’ last loss to Tampa Bay that it’s hard to see them solving all of their issues in a matter of four days. If Jameis Winston could throw 5 TD passes, what’s going to stop Stafford and Johnson, aka, Megatron, from having a mega game? For the Eagles’ offense, not having Ertz will hurt. And there is no one at wide receiver to stretch the Lions’ defense. Unless Murray can break tackles and get the run game going, it’s hard to see the offense getting untracked.\n\nThe pick: Lions 27, Eagles 20.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/25"}]}

Renderings show a tan-and-brown building with balconies facing the ocean above retail space along the boardwalk. Grotto Pizza would relocate to the corner of the former Dolle's.\n\nAccording to the plans, the project would have two levels of underground parking. Above the ground-floor retail on the second floor, there would be 16 hotel rooms, a gym, an outdoor pool and a breakfast room. The remaining 44 hotel rooms would be on the upper floors.\n\nGrotto Pizza has partnered with Onix Group, a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, company that helped develop the Wilmington Riverfront Hyatt Place and event space among other properties in southern Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania. After purchasing the Dolle's property at the beginning of 2021 for $6 million, they together control all of the properties along the boardwalk between Rehoboth and Baltimore avenues, including the closed Sirroco Motel, the former Nick's Luncheonette, Zelky's Beach Arcade and the former Dolle's building.\n\nTheir plan also encompasses the Kohr Bros. storefront next to the former Dolle's.\n\nREHOBOTH BEACH: How these planned beach hotels could change the look of the Rehoboth boardwalk\n\nThe Rehoboth Beach Planning Commission offered a preliminary review of the plans Monday afternoon. The project will return to the Planning Commission at a later date for a public hearing before a vote for approval.\n\nThe project requires a variance for the property to be developed at a greater floor-area ratio than permitted by city code. Rehoboth Beach city code limits projects to a FAR of 2.0, meaning the total size of the building can't exceed two times the size of the lot it is constructed on.\n\nAs proposed, the Grotto Pizza project calls for a FAR of 2.76. It meets all other standards of city code.\n\nThe FAR variance is the same variance the Papajohn family sought for its hotel project at the opposite corner of Rehoboth Avenue. Their proposal calls for a four-story luxury hotel in the image of the former Bellhaven Hotel with 116 rooms, balconies, a zero-edge pool, a conference center, an exercise room and underground parking.\n\nPREVIOUS REPORTING: Boardwalk hotel modeled after historic Rehoboth Beach landmark clears major hurdle\n\nThe Rehoboth Beach Board of Adjustment approved the variance request late last year.\n\nMore than 100 Rehoboth Beach residents signed a letter opposing the variance, arguing the hotel would have an \"adverse impact\" on the town because its size goes against Rehoboth Beach's character and would \"open the flood gates\" for further expansion in commercial areas and increased hotel density.\n\nRehoboth Beach resident Francis Markert filed a lawsuit challenging the variance approval. A Superior Court judge in September ruled in the Board of Adjustment's favor, upholding the variance. The project must still go through the city's site plan review process, starting with a hearing before the Planning Commission, before construction can begin.\n\nMarkert joined the Rehoboth Beach Board of Commissioners in June.\n\nA Rehoboth Beach institution for almost 100 years, Dolle's Candyland left its coveted corner at the end of January 2021. Owner Tom Ibach moved Dolle's a few doors west, merging it with his other storefront Ibach's Candy by the Sea.\n\nIbach is the third generation of his family to run the saltwater taffy, popcorn and candy business. He said he decided to move when his landlord asked for double the current rent at the expiration of his lease.\n\nCo-founders Thomas Pachides and Rudolph Dolle in 1927 bought what was then an old YMCA building at Rehoboth Avenue and the boardwalk for $30,000, according to Dolle's website.

We applaud the efforts of Grotto Pizza,\" she said. \"The Sierra Club hopes to see these efforts expanded throughout the state.\"\n\nKenton said the changes with plastics are limited to coastal locations due to the sheer number of visitors at the beach during the summer and the increased likelihood of balloons being lost outside.\n\nBarra hopes Grotto will expand the plastics ban to the rest of its locations in the future: \"Depending on where these other restaurants are, plastics can still end up in the watershed.\"\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in Reboboth Beach in 1960 and now boasts 23 locations in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.

But St. Edmond's was not able to meet the deadline, as the church did not hear back from other religious organizations in time before the creche was ordered to be taken down, Bailey said.\n\nThe Nativity scene has \"been up in the town for years,\" Bailey said. \"This is the first year we've had a problem.\"\n\nKuhns said the Nativity scene has not been on public display in recent years.

The record at that location is 9.2 feet, reached April 16, 2011, NWS meteorologist Nick Carr said on Thursday.\n\nBecause the system is lasting through five consecutive tide cycles, that means built up water in back bays and estuaries has nowhere to go until the event subsides, the weather service warned.\n\nA gale warning also is in effect along the coast, where ocean waves are reaching up to 14 feet during the event.

They've scaled back their Sussex County operations to simply offer pizza, stromboli and salad.\n\nRose says her top sellers are the margarita pie and a pizza topped with spinach, ricotta and tomato. A recent, and excellent, roadie slice of this Neapolitan-style pizza had a small, brown air bubble along the rim and a crunchy crust.\n\nThe pizzeria, just off Garfield Parkway, Bethany's main drag, is a tiny spot situated between Kohr Brothers and Dickey's Ice Cream. Pomodoro is open nine months out of the year. Rose says they'll likely close for the year just before Christmas, and plan to reopen for the 2020 season around March.\n\nWhat you had to say: Gina McKinney said her favorite pizza in Delaware is \"Pomodoro's in Bethany. Hands down.\"\n\n1011 S. College Ave., Newark, 302-456-3344; mariospizzade.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: To score big near a college town, you need to be memorable. And Mario's thin and cheesy pizza has a crispy crust with a perfect chew.\n\nThe pizzeria, owned by Ciro Delprete, has been at its strip shopping center location, not too far the University of Delaware's football stadium, for about 20 years. Delprete's son-in-law Mario Censullo is the shop's manager.\n\nMario's says it offers \"a taste of New York in Newark, Delaware.\" You can get modern flavors like Buffalo chicken pizza, but the shop says the square-shaped \"Grandma's Own\" is their signature item. It's a thin, crispy crust pizza made with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, garlic and marinara sauce.\n\n\"So good you'll slap your grandma,\" says a description on their website. But, thankfully, they also add, \"please don't slap your grandma.\"\n\nWhat you had to say: Thomas Turner says his favorite pizza is Mario's.\n\n124 Fox Hunt Drive, Fox Run Shopping Center, Bear, 302-834 -3424; rivierapizzafoxrun.weebly.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Put away your cellphone and pull up your pants. There are signs everywhere at Riviera Pizza reminding customers to be polite, courteous and, well, not have droopy drawers.\n\nThe shop in the Fox Run Shopping Center, near the Acme Market and next to a nail salon, has all the sass and attitude you want in a pizzeria. And Riviera certainly knows what they're doing. They've been in business for more than 25 years.\n\nCustomers come for the golden, thin crust, classic pizza slices that are bendable, but not floppy. You can eat-in at one of the booths or take a pizza to go.\n\nJust, please, don't take money out of your bra to pay for your food. Another sign on the counter says that's a big Riviera Pizza no-no because \"no one wants your boob sweat.\"\n\nWhat you had to say: Dante Giardina says Riviera Pizza in Fox Run has Delaware's best pizza \"and it's not even close. LOL.\" Tommy Cilia's also a fan, saying he's \"been going there since I was 12yrs old.\"\n\n1706 Faulkland Road, Chestnut Run Shopping Center, near Prices Corner, 302-633-6801; littlevinniespizza.com/home.html\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: There are eight tables in Little Vinnie's pizzeria area, but don't let the size fool you. There's an adjoining eatery, Vinnie's Cafe, that's even larger.\n\nA recent lunch visit showed a steady stream of customers coming for cheesesteaks and grabbing seats for plates of pasta. But the pizza should not be missed.\n\nThe pizza's tomato sauce, savory with a very appealing hint of oregano, is spread with a light hand that keeps the very thin and light crust crisp. There's a subtle snap when you bend a hot triangle slice in half.\n\nLittle Vinnie's has pizza specials every day. Check the chalkboard above the counter. On a Tuesday visit, two slices of cheese pizza and a fountain soda was $5. Hours are bit wonky. Unlike some pizzerias, Little Vinnie's is closed Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nWhat you had to say: Amie Noel says when it comes to pizza, she craves \"a perfectly foldable slice\" at Little Vinnie's.\n\n140 E. Cleveland Ave., Newark, 302-737-2135; wfpshop.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Matt Hans started his pizza on-the-go concept from the back of a 1956 plum tomato red Ford 250 flatbed in 2010. Four years later, he moved the business into the former bait and tackle shop in downtown Newark.\n\nWooden tables, metal accents and a wood-fired pizza oven imported from Naples, Italy, are the centerpiece on the back wall. The oven, surrounded by stucco, is fueled only by wood logs and delivers 800-degree temperatures, allowing for a 90-second pizza.\n\nIn September, Hans sold the business to chef Brian Callahan, formerly of Drip Cafe and Homegrown Cafe.\n\nThe 12-inch pizzas, which feature desirable leopard spotting on the rim, serve 1 to 2 people. Any pizza can be made with a gluten-free crust for an additional fee.\n\nWe like the changing specialties like the B-52 ($19.50), a pizza made with lobster cream sauce, Asiago and fresh mozzarella cheeses and lemon parsley gremolata. Another winner was the farm fresh pie ($16.25) topped with local butternut squash, fresh mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheeses, along with rosemary and walnut oil.\n\nPizzas also can be made with dairy-free vegan cheese. The pizzeria, serving craft beer, wine and cocktails, is extending its hours. Starting next week, it will be Tuesdays through Sundays.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Fresh ingredients, amazing specials, and absolutely fantastic pizzas!\" says fan Patti Lehker Buttrey.\n\nNew Castle Farmers Market, 110 N. Dupont Highway, New Castle, 302-328-5845\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Like The Wood Fired Pizza shop, Mama Gina Pizza has limited hours and days of the week that it's open.\n\nThe pizzeria has a counter, along with tables and chairs, inside the New Castle Farmers Market. The market operates from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays.\n\nThe name can be a little confusing. A neon sign at the business says Mama Gina, but the business Facebook page and a banner at the counter has a slightly different spelling of Mamma Gina.\n\nHere you can get pizza by the slice or a whole pie \"with toppings galore.\" The pizzeria is owned by Salvatore Illiano. Pizza varieties include Philly cheesesteak and barbecue chicken. Hit up an ATM before dining. Mamma Gina is cash-only.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Mamma Gina's is awesome,\" says customer Robert K. Strohmaier.\n\nCommunity Plaza Shopping Center, 287 Christiana Road, New Castle; 302-307-4518\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: The white pizza boxes stacked at the counter signals that Little Anthony's does steady business. The slice shop, between Bargain World Beauty and Sang Hing restaurant, is in the Community Plaza Shopping Center off Del. 273.\n\nAmerican and Italian flags hang side-by-side at the eatery that's decorated with white tile. Little Anthony's offers 17-inch Sicilian-style deep-dish pizzas, but, according to News Journal readers, the traditional, thin crust New York-style pizzas are a customer favorite.\n\nToppings include grilled chicken, bacon, eggplant, meatball, Hawaiian and a Little Anthony's special of pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onion and extra cheese.\n\nSimplicity rules supreme. A $2 slice of cheese pizza marries savory tomato sauce, melty cheese with no greasy puddles and an admirable snappy crust.\n\nWhat you had to say: Michela Robins says when she needs a pizza fix it has to be \"Little Anthony's on Del. 273 for its New York-style pizza.\"\n\n1600 Delaware Ave., Wilmington, 302-654-5331; giannispizzatrolleysquare.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Don't get confused if pizza lovers still refer to this staple of Wilmington's Trolley Square neighborhood as Ciao Pizza. That was its name for more than 15 years.\n\nDue to a trademark conflict, the Esposito family in 2017 had to change the name of Ciao Pizza to Gianni’s Pizza.\n\nWhile there have been improvements to the outdoor patio and the addition of beer to the menu, the pizza remains the same high quality.\n\nThe pizzeria at the corner of Delaware Avenue and Clayton Street is one of Trolley Square's most recognizable sites. It also was one of the stops Joe Biden chose to make in April after he announced he was running for President in 2020.\n\nWhile Gianni's has flavors such as barbecue chicken with bacon and ranch dressing, Biden, a traditionalist, ordered a pepperoni pie. You can now also get pizza made with a cauliflower crust. Pizza by the slice starts at $2.50\n\nWhat you had to say: Amanda Miller picks Gianni’s as one of her favorite pizzerias in Delaware.\n\n1004 Kings Highway, Lewes, 302-645-1900; mrppizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Mr. P's is so popular on weekends that regular customers know to put in their takeout pizza orders hours ahead of time.\n\nYou'll see the orders, written on green pieces of paper, hanging on a line near the wood-fired pizza Ambrogi oven that was handcrafted in Italy. It fires up to around 900 degrees.\n\nMr. P's is named after former owner John Perrin, who had owned the Il Forno Pizzerias in Gaithersburg, Bethesda and Frederick, Maryland. It's now owned by Rick Thomas who worked and later owned some of the Il Forno sites.\n\nBe patient at Mr. P's. The pizzeria/restaurant has only one pizza cook and one oven. They can only bake so many pizzas at one time.\n\nStill, Mr. P's, open since 2000, has legions of fans coming for the pies that are created with hand-tossed dough and chunky tomato sauce that is made in-house. Slices are available daily, but only until just before, or slightly after, 3 p.m. A recent slice of pepperoni was on the floppy side. This is a cash-only business, though there is an ATM on site.\n\nWhat you had to say: Gene Kulesza used a heart emoji to express his love for Mr. P’s.\n\n2667 Kirkwood Highway, Meadowood Shopping Center, near Newark, 302-731-8200; argillabrewing.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Argilla Brewing Co @ Pietro’s Pizza is not so much a pizzeria as it is a restaurant, bar and a very good brewery. But it has pizzeria roots.\n\nWhen owner Steve Powell owned Argilla in March 2012 in the Meadowood Shopping Center near Newark, the avid home brewer who has been dabbling in beer making for eight years, wanted to showcase his skills. He renovated the former Grey Fox Restaurant and Pub and Argilla became, at that time, the state’s smallest brewery.\n\nPizza is the perfect pairing with beer and it's a main offering at Argilla. If the Pietro’s name sounds familiar, you might have been acquainted with Powell's family’s former takeout business.\n\nPietro’s Pizza was founded by Steve’s father, Rodger Powell in 1978. The pizzeria opened on Greenbank Road in Prices Corner, had a storefront on Churchmans Road and later moved to Pike Creek. For more than 20 years, Pietro’s was a four-table shop in a strip shopping center off New Linden Hill Road.\n\nWhen that operation closed, the Powells moved the eatery to the Kirkwood Highway building. The Pietro's sign hangs in the dining room.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Argilla Brewing Co. at Pietro's Pizza is my favorite and go-to place for a pie,\" says Herb Crowe. \"My favorite is a pork and pepper pie.\"\n\n831 N.

The crust has good crackle.\n\nFather-and-son team Pino and Antimo DiMeo were originally running the restaurant. Pino DiMeo has not been involved in running the Wilmington location since 2012.\n\nAntimo DiMeo is now executive chef at the nearby Bardea restaurant that was nominated for a James Beard Award in 2018 as one of the country's best new restaurants.\n\nWhat you had to say: Lisa Cirillo McInnis says her favorite DiMeo's Pizza is the \"one with spinach and mushrooms that is out of this world. You MUST try it.\"\n\nConcord Mall, 302-478-8288; caferivierade.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: A red neon sign announces you've arrived at Cafe Riviera, a Delaware favorite for nearly 40 years.\n\nMichael J. Tumolo has run this family pizzeria and restaurant inside the Concord Mall since 1981. An inviting selection of pizzas-by-the-slice awaits on the counter, there's also seating in the adjoining dining room, in an second floor area and outside of the eatery. They'll slide a slice into the oven while you wait\n\nTumolo also has the food truck Pizzeria Pronto. Cafe Riviera expanded recently and Michael's son Dan is now running La Pizzeria Metro, a new and excellent pizzeria off Miller Road next to Wilmington Brew Works.\n\nWhat you had to say: Café Riviera in the Concord Mall is Jeremy Kramlik's first choice when it comes to First State pizza.\n\n366 Possum Park Road, Newark, 302-737-2411; ilovetonyscafe.com/\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Italian-born owner Luigi Illiano has been making pizza at Tony's Cafe since 2002. He serves a Neapolitan-style pie and uses fresh ingredients. Obsessed with quality, Illiano says he doesn't have any freezers.\n\nSo what is Tony's most popular pie?\n\n\"There's too many to name,\" Illiano says, though he concedes that the \"grandmom\" is probably the biggest seller.\n\nCustomers also like Tony's crab pizza.\n\nWhat you had to say: Adrienne Little says when she wants some 'za, she goes to \"Tony’s Cafe near Newark! Great pizzas!\"\n\nNewport Plaza, 218 Market St., Newport, 302-998-7154; ilovedomspizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Owner Dom Filingeri has owned his Newport shop since 2005. He serves \"100 percent New York-style\" pizza.\n\nIf you're lucky, you just might see Filingeri flipping and spinning dough behind the counter. He says loyal customers like the shop's \"overall authenticity. It's craft pizza.\" Filnigeri is also a stickler for consistency. Slices taste and look the same way every day.\n\nFilingeri cooks his pizza on a stone. He says the dough is thin, hand-stretched, crispy and little puffy.\n\nHis most popular pies are cheese and chicken parmigiana, but those who want to go beyond the norm should try the grilled chicken Caesar (a white pizza with chicken, Romaine lettuce and Pecorino Romano). Pie can also be topped with everything from fried eggplant to hot banana peppers.\n\nWhat you had to say: Wayne Vaughn said, \"Dom's is the best, hands down. Best wings too!\"\n\nTwo locations: 8 N. First St. and 71 Rehoboth Ave., both in Rehoboth; nicolapizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Owner Nicholas Caggiano gave Delaware's pizza culture the Nic-o-Boli, the First State's version of the stromboli. And it remains one of Delaware's most popular fast eats.\n\nGiven the number of customers usually waiting for tables in summer months, Caggiano's two Rehoboth eateries are among the most trusted and nostalgic stops in the Sussex County sandtown when it comes to a pizza pit stop.\n\nNicola Pizza has called Delaware home since 1971. The pizzerias remain an unstoppable force, despite the 2017 death of Joan Caggiano, Nicholas' wife. Joan Caggiano was a fixture in the business, frequently stopping by tables and making customers feel like family.\n\nNicolas Caggiano and son Nick Jr., Joan's son, continue on with the daily operations at the charming flagship operation at 8 N. First St., which hasn't changed much over the years, as well as the second location on Rehoboth Avenue that opened in 2010.\n\nNicola has grown from 17 seats in its original location to 400 seats overall. The pizza crust is crunchy, and maybe a little thicker than traditional New York-style.\n\nCelebrity photos fill the walls at the flagship shop and in recent years rock star Dave Grohl has been spotted eating at Nicola Pizza and taking photos with fans.\n\nWhat you had to say: Nicola’s in Rehoboth has the heart of Amanda Hart.\n\nMultiple locations in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania; grottopizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: So much sentimental affection, and arguments, surround Grotto Pizza, the old-school, go-to Delaware-based chain that's been around for almost 60 years.\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in 1960 by Dominick Pulieri, along with his brother-in-law, Joe, and sister Mary Jean Paglianite. At the first take-out stand, pizza slices sold for 20 cents.\n\nA second Grotto Pizza on the Rehoboth boardwalk opened in 1963. The chain now has more than 20 locations.\n\nGROTTO:Grotto Pizza's super-secret dough recipe; 10 more fun facts about Delaware's best known pizza\n\nSince 1960, only about a dozen people have been told the dough recipe — and they each had to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe pies feature cheddar cheese, which is sprinkled on first, and then the sweet-tasting tomato sauce is applied in a signature swirl. The use of cheddar, rather than traditional mozzarella, gives the Grotto pie its distinctive taste. (And blotting the top of a slice with a napkin to soak up \"cheese juice\" is a Grotto Pizza tradition.)\n\nPeople either loved the Grotto Pizza combinations or can't understand the appeal. There seems to be no middle ground.\n\nOur favorite is easily the beachside boardwalk pizza at the original site on Rehoboth Avenue. We'll chalk it up to the salt in the air, the sounds of the crashing sea, the squawking, and sometimes dive bombing, gulls. One bite brings back warm summer memories and adventures with family and friends.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Grotto's or nothing,\" says Lacy Serman Farmer.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}]}

The box acts as a makeshift podium. If you win one of the high school invitational races, this is where you end up.\n\nThe nation’s largest track and field meet added the 3,000 meters to its program in 1965. In all that time, no Shore Conference boy has ever had to scoot from the finish line to that spot. That changed on Friday night thanks to Devin Hart.\n\nThe Point Boro junior assumed control immediately, eventually ripping off a 64-second bell lap to shake Wilmington (Del.) Friends junior Connor Nisbet for the win in 8:22.24.\n\nHart, the reigning NJSIAA Meet of Champions winner at 3200 meters indoors and outdoors, is only the sixth New Jerseyan to win the Penn 3000.\n\n“This is definitely something I’ve never experienced before,” said Hart, who had a loud contingent of friends and family stationed near the finish line along the backstretch. “I haven’t really won something out of state like this, with this kind of venue and this kind of field, so there was pressure going in.\n\n“I had a lot of nerves going into this race compared to most races. I knew I had a shot to win it, but there were a ton of guys that run the same times as me.”\n\nA 66-second lap took Hart through the bell in approximately 7:18. At that point, Hart had already begun to move away from Nisbet, Delaware’s state champion indoors at 3200. With about 200 meters to go, Hart made a second move to create space. Nesbit didn’t have an answer in taking second in 8:27.68.\n\nDrew Maher takes third in mile\n\nBefore Hart toed the line, the Shore senior entered the mile with legitimate aspirations of his own history-making moment.\n\nThings went out conservatively in approximately 2:08, setting up Maher to kick, but he could not overtake the field, finishing third in 4:11.94.\n\nMaher, the indoor MOC at 1600 in Feb. and runner-up outdoors last spring, went with about 275 meters to go, then again with 150 left, but winner Kieran McDermott (4:09.63) and runner-up Cameron Ponder (4:10.98) held him off.\n\n\"I was trying to not go out from the start and see what they do,\" Maher said. \"They got a little space. I tried to get it back, but I just didn't have enough.\n\n\"I saw with about 100 to go it wasn't going to happen. I'm still happy with the race.\"\n\nJackson Liberty boys register top local 4x800 time\n\nFor as pristine as the weather was on Thursday, Friday morning offered the opposite, rainy and raw.\n\nThe gigantic meet, aptly dubbed a carnival, has been contested in worse, though, so Friday morning's main event, the boys 4x800 small and large-school heats, went off without a hitch.\n\nJackson Liberty junior Joe Devito brought the Lions home on Friday morning, running a 1:59.11 anchor for a third-place finish in their small-school heat in 8:05.92. That was the fastest time by a Shore Conference team on Friday, and stands as the fifth-fastest time by a Shore Conference team this spring.\n\nIn that same small-school heat, Ocean, owner of a Shore Conference No. 1 8:03.85 earlier this month, finished 11th in 8:12.87. Manasquan's 8:07.59, capped by Ryan McNamara's 1:59.52 anchor leg, was good for seventh in the other small-school heat.\n\nSeventeen teams went under 8:00, with the top-12 qualifying for Saturday's Championship of America. The cutoff for the C of A this year was 7:58.75. No Shore Conference boys team has qualified for the Penn 4x800 final since Freehold Township since 2010.\n\nMidd. South's Madison Brand takes sixth in girls mile\n\nThe Eagles senior forced her way into the statewide conversation at 1600 meters last spring, then took it a step further in February by winning the NJSIAA Meet of Champions indoors.\n\nOn the heels of her indoor performance and a productive cross country season, Brand appears to be lined up to do something significant this spring. Thursday's Penn Relays mile offered her first chance this spring, for all intents and purposes, at racing this spring, and she fared well, clocking in at 5:02.34 for sixth at Franklin Field.\n\nComplete NJ coverage of the Penn Relays\n\nBrand's sixth-place showing is the fourth Top 7 finish by a Shore Conference girl in the Penn mile since 2007.\n\nBrand, who was running the full mile for only the second time (2017 New Balance Outdoor Nationals), was seventh at the bell, then put together a 64-second final lap to get up for sixth in a race in which only three girls broke 5:00.\n\nPenn Relays: Ridge, Union C 4x800s make final\n\nNorthern (Pa.) High School sophomore Marlee Starliper, the reigning Pennsylvania state cross country champion and the third-place finisher indoors at 1600 meters, was the winner in a personal-best 4:47.51.\n\nMatawan girls fare well in DMR\n\nMatawan, seeded 16th in its first-ever Penn distance medley relay, finished ninth in 12:26.29. Huskies senior Rachel Kenny anchored in 5:06.81. Kenny, capable of scoring at 800 and 1600 meters for a Matawan team that generally contends for sectional and group titles, has gone as fast as 2:14.52 and 5:03.14, respectively, outdoors.\n\nPenn Relays: 5 things to watch for\n\nGirls 4x800 heats feature Rumson-Fair Haven\n\nA Shore Conference girls 4x800 team has not made the Championship of America at the Penn Relays since 2014.\n\nThat streak will continue for at least another year. Rumson-Fair Haven, anchored by Julia Tambaro's 2:21.83 closing leg, finished sixth in its small-school heat in 9:36.29. That was the top local time of the morning, but with the Top 12 finishers across four heats qualifying for C of A, outside the cutoff of 9:25.11.\n\nCooper: Muccio does double duty at Penn Relays\n\nToms River South finished 11th in that heat in 9:43.23, with Red Bank Catholic in 12th at 9:45.89. The Caseys were appearing in the Penn 4x800 for the 13th year in a row.\n\nIn the first large-school heat, Colts Neck was 13th in 9:44.25, and Freehold Township, appearing in the Penn 4x800 for the fourth time in six years, was 15th in 10:01.84.\n\nThe Red Bank Catholic girls 4x400 team of Tess Darnell (1:00.86), Anna Cleary (1:00.40), Jackie Rieger (1:00.07) and Jessie Castellano (58.97) ran the fastest time of the day by a Shore Conference team, clocking in fourth at a respectable 4:00.29. That stands as the top time by a Shore Conference team this spring.\n\nThe Caseys, though, fell victim to a fast heat, as the three teams ahead of them all went 3:46.56 or better.\n\nStaff Writer Josh Newman: jnewman@app.com; @Joshua_Newman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2017/04/11/joe-vedilago-holds-top-psac-time-400/100323210/", "title": "Joe Vedilago holds the top PSAC time in the 400", "text": "Bill Arsenault\n\nFor The Daily News\n\nJoe Vedilago is running wild with the California (Pa.) men’s outdoor track team once again.\n\nThe senior, a Northern Lebanon grad, is the Vulcans’ top 400-meter dash runner and a member of the team’s solid 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams.\n\nVedilago finished fifth out of 58 sprinters in a 400 at the George Mason Spring Invitational last Saturday in Fairfax, Va. Running against mainly Division I and club athletes, his time was 48.62. He also ran a leg on the 4x100 relay that finished second to Virginia Commonwealth in a time of 41.79, which is third best on the PSAC performance list.\n\nOn March 31, Vedilago had a big effort at the Bethany (W.Va.) Invitational, winning the 400 (49.98) and running legs on the winning 4x100 (42.76) and 4x400 (3:22.82) relays. And, his 48.17 time in winning the 400 at the Cal U. Early Bird meet on March 25 is the top mark in the PSAC.\n\n“Joe is continuing to expand his understanding of the 400 and that newfound knowledge is allowing him to perform at his most consistent level ever,” Cal coach Daniel Caulfield said. “It was very windy at the George Mason meet, but Joe was still able to run in the mid-48s. He will undoubtedly set some big PRs (personal records) in the weeks to come.”\n\nThe Vulcans have a busy weekend ahead competing in Bucknell’s Bison Outdoor Classic on Friday in Lewisburg and the Towson (Md.) Invitational on Saturday.\n\nAlex Rich (Cedar Crest): The sophomore moved into the starting lineup for the Louisville women’s lacrosse team after a senior was lost for the season with a broken arm.

The unit posted a time of 1:29.83, which placed them 13th out of 22 teams in a field made up mainly of Division I schools. Last weekend, at the Rider Invitational, Snyder was a member of the 4x400 relay that finished sixth in 3:30.23. He also runs the 100, 200 and 400 sprints for the Bald Eagles.\n\nJoel Lohr (Palmyra): The Edinboro junior finished fifth in the 400-meter dash at the PSAC West Challenge last Saturday in Indiana with a time of 51.62. That time was a big improvement over the 52.45 he posted when he finished fifth in the Dave Labor Invitational on April 1 in Slippery Rock. Lohr has also raced in the 100 and 200 for the Fighting Scots this spring.\n\nHunter Torres (Cedar Crest): The sophomore is 0-1 with a save in nine games pitching in relief for the Albany baseball team (10-13, 3-6 in the America East Conference). The 6-foot, 160-pound left-hander has a 5.28 earned run average, having worked 15.1 innings and given up 16 hits and 11 runs, nine earned, with four walks and 11 strikeouts. Torres collected his save in an 8-3 victory over Stony Brook on April 1. He worked three innings and gave up one hit and two runs, one earned, with a walk and two strikeouts.\n\nNicholas Auchenbach (Northern Lebanon): The Mansfield sophomore finished third in the 400 hurdles at the Delaware Open last Saturday. His time was 56.72. On April 1, at the Millersville Metrics, he captured the 400 dash in 50.92 and ran a leg on the 4x400 relay which finished sixth in 3:42.47. Auchenbach opened the outdoor season by finishing second in the 400 hurdles (56.38), eighth in the 200 dash (wind-aided 23.06) and running a leg on the 4x400 relay, which finished sixth (3:35.90) at the Fred Hardy Invite.\n\nJoey Hess (Palmyra): The 6-foot-1, 205-pound junior attack has three goals and an assist for the Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse team (2-7, 0-3 in Centennial Conference).

Her discus throw broke a 10-year old record by nearly two feet.\n\nNatalie Swingholm, Elco\n\nThe county champ in the 300 hurdles last year as a freshman, Swingholm, also a standout soccer player, looks to be a strong contender for another county title at this year's event, set for April 28 at Lebanon High School.\n\nKirstin West, Palmyra\n\nAlso the catalyst of Palmyra's district championship volleyball team, West had a huge junior year with the spear, striking district gold and placing fourth in the event at the state meet.\n\nThe sky is the limit for her this spring as she looks to wrap up a distinguished high school athletic career in style before heading off to the University of Pennsylvania to continue her academic and track and field careers.\n\nCamryn Simpson, Palmyra\n\nLike her teammate West, Simpson had a big junior year, placing third in the long jump and fifth in the triple jump at districts, then adding a fourth place finish in the triple jump at states.\n\nA Pitt recruit, Simpson is capable of doing it again - and even more - if she can shake off a sprained ankle that has hampered her in the early stages of the season.\n\nBoys\n\nAnnville-Cleona\n\nCoach: Jerome Simon, 2nd year\n\nLast year's record: 4-2\n\nKey performers lost: Cameron Hoch, Griffin Hertz, Mark Nace, Brayden Turner\n\nTop returning performers: Stanley Miller (sprints & long jump), Noah Myers (shot put, jav, discus), Ethan Fortuna, Dylan Scheer, Romeo Varela (4x400m relay)\n\nPromising newcomers: Michael Moran (sprints/jumps), Jack Tshudy (middle distance)\n\nOutlook: \"We have a nice mix of experienced athletes and some promising young athletes,\" Simon said. \"We hope to gain valuable meet experience early in the season and hope that it will pay off at the District 3 meet.

Kay Ivey is calling lawmakers into special session this month to vote on a prison construction plan that would use part of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to jump-start the building of three new lockups. In a letter to lawmakers announcing the special session, Ivey painted the construction project as a partial solution to the state’s long-standing prison woes, which have included a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit over violence and a separate federal court order to improve mental health treatment behind bars. “Failure to timely resolve these issues outlined in federal lawsuits could result in detrimental consequences for our state,” Ivey wrote to lawmakers. “Achieving an Alabama solution to these problems – rather than a federal court-ordered solution – is paramount.” While proponents said the construction would be a partial solution, one lawmaker said it would put “old problems in new buildings” unless the state made additional reforms. “Just building prisons without engaging in some sort of comprehensive criminal justice reform is the definition of kicking the can down the road,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. On the use of federal pandemic funds on the project, England said there are “obviously better uses of the money.” Ivey said the special session would begin Sept. 27.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of Afghan refugees will be resettled in the state over the next six months, according to a resettlement organization. Between 50 and 100 refugees will come to Alaska starting in September, Catholic Social Services Refugee Assistance and Immigration Services said in a statement. Resettlement will continue through March. Catholic Social Services Alaska CEO Lisa Aquino told the Associated Press it wasn’t known when the first refugees would arrive in Alaska, but the organization will be ready for them. The refugees were described as being in vulnerable populations, such as children, women and the elderly. Many worked for the U.S. government or the military in Afghanistan in positions like translators. Thousands of Afghanis were evacuated after American forces left Afghanistan last month. They were first sent to military bases in the Lower 48 for screening and preparing to be sent to destinations around the U.S. The refugees, including individuals and families, will work with program staff in several areas like employment and English-language skills after arriving in Anchorage. Aquino said it wasn’t known how many would settle in other parts of the state, but it’s expected a majority would remain in Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: As the state’s biggest hospitals fill up with COVID-19 patients – most unvaccinated – physicians in some smaller, more rural communities say their patients who need specialty care are paying the ultimate price. The inability to find a bed has left smaller facilities such as Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital in Green Valley frustrated. A Tucson gastroenterologist drove to Green Valley last week to operate on a patient who couldn’t be transferred anywhere in the state to get the surgery. The hospital has filed a complaint with the Arizona Department of Health Services about the inability to transfer, the Arizona Daily Star reports. The patient lived “only because this doctor was nice enough, was human enough to save his life,” said Stephen Harris, the hospital’s CEO. In Cochise County, Dr. Cristian Laguillo, a senior physician with Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, said he has never felt this helpless trying to assist patients – even while serving a tour in Afghanistan as a combat medic. A surge line was created in April 2020 by the state Department of Health Services to facilitate transfers of COVID-19 patients across the state. But it’s meant to be used to track down beds for COVID-19 patients. Laguillo said he thinks the state surge line has to change to be for all patients in critical need, not just virus patients.\n\nArkansas\n\nLonoke: A former sheriff’s deputy charged with manslaughter for fatally shooting a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of civil rights activists was released Monday on $15,000 bond. Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County sheriff’s office, is set to appear again in court Nov. 15, Little Rock television station KTHV reports. Davis was charged Friday with felony manslaughter in the death of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis, who is also white, shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop. Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley fired Davis in July, saying the former deputy did not turn on his body camera until after the shooting. Investigators have said Brittain was holding a container at the time of the shooting, and they did not find any firearms in or around the teen’s truck. Davis’ attorney has said the former deputy plans to plead not guilty. Brittain was eulogized by the Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd’s family. They said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for changes in policing. Brittain’s family and friends have regularly demonstrated outside the Lonoke County sheriff’s office, demanding more details on the shooting.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom has approved two measures to slice through local zoning ordinances as the most populous state struggles with soaring home prices, an affordable housing shortage and stubborn homelessness. He signed the most prominent legislation despite nearly 250 cities objecting that it will, by design, undermine local planning and control. The outcome marks the latest battle between what’s come to be thought of as “NIMBY vs. YIMBY.” While most agree there is an affordable housing shortage, proposed construction often runs into “not in my backyard” opposition. “The housing affordability crisis is undermining the California Dream for families across the state, and threatens our long-term growth and prosperity,” Newsom said in announcing his approval Thursday. He also announced the state will put $1.75 billion into what his administration is calling a new California Housing Accelerator, which he said will speed building 6,500 affordable multifamily units that had been stalled for lack of tax-exempt bonds and low-income housing tax credits. It’s part of $22 billion that the state plans to spend to spur new housing and ease homelessness along with the new laws. The bill by Senate leader Toni Atkins would require cities to approve up to four housing units on what was a single-family lot.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state panel has recommended that a mountain peak west of Denver be renamed in honor of a Native American woman who acted as a translator for tribes and white settlers in the 19th century. Thursday’s recommendation comes amid national efforts to address a history of colonialism and oppression against Native Americans and other people of color after last summer’s protests calling for racial justice reform. It is the first of several name changes being considered by the state panel. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board recommended changing the name of Squaw Mountain, located in Clear Creek County about 30 miles miles west of Denver, to Mestaa’ehehe Mountain, which is pronounced “mess-taw-hay.” The name honors an influential Cheyenne translator known as Owl Woman who facilitated relations between white settlers and Native American tribes in the early 1800s, The Colorado Sun reports. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: One restaurant is taking an unorthodox approach to addressing staff shortages: robot servers to serve meals. The operator of the New London location of the Shaking Crab told The Day the ocean-themed restaurant will use regular waiters and waitresses to explain the menu and take orders, but the robots will deliver the meals to the tables. Gulshan Soni told the newspaper the robots can be summoned with a bell. The innovation is partly for showmanship and to draw in customers with something unique, he said, and partly to address staffing shortages being experienced across the industry. The four robots cost between $6,000 and $22,000, Soni said. The restaurant is scheduled to open to the public in early October. The Shaking Crab has more than two dozen locations in the northeastern U.S. and China, according to its website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In uplifting news for environmentalists, Delawareans can no longer release balloons into the sky, thanks to a law Gov. John Carney signed Friday. The bill that lawmakers passed in June makes it illegal to intentionally release balloons in the First State. Releasing up to four balloons is considered littering and can mean a fine of $25 or more. Releasing five or more balloons brings a fine of $250 and up to eight hours of community service for the first offense. Maryland and Virginia passed similar laws earlier this year. While Carney has dedicated much of his tenure to a litter-reduction campaign, the bill isn’t just intended to prevent residents from suffering the sight of latex balloon remnants scattered across the state. The new law is also meant to protect wildlife, according to environmentalists. “Balloons have long polluted shorelines of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, adding to the plastic pollution that threatens both marine life and the roughly 225,000 jobs in the three states that depend on a clean coast,” Oceana field campaigns manager Caroline Wood said in a statement. Delawareans can still throw water balloons as long as they pick up the trash after they pop. People planning celebrations or mourning events can visit preventballoonlitter.org to find other ideas in lieu of balloon releases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After showing signs of coughing, sneezing and a lack of appetite, nine big cats at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Zoo tested positive for the coronavirus. The Smithsonian said Friday that six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers exhibited symptoms and tested presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The final results are expected in the coming days, the Smithsonian said on its website. “All lions and tigers are being treated with anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication to address discomfort and decreased appetite,” the zoo said on its website. “In addition, all are being treated with antibiotics for presumptive secondary bacterial pneumonia. They remain under close observation.” Due to the social distance between visitors and animals, the public is at no risk for the coronavirus. The zoo confirmed no other animals were exhibiting symptoms as of Friday. Zookeepers conducted an investigation of all staff and animals, and the source of the outbreak wasn’t found, according to the website. The first round of the COVID-19 vaccine made for zoo animals by Zoetis has been authorized for use by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Zoo has said it will disburse the first round of vaccines among “susceptible species” in the coming months.\n\nFlorida\n\nOcala: A woman floating on a paddleboard in the Silver River used her paddle to push away a large alligator that swam directly toward her in a frightful, up-close encounter captured in startling videos and photographs. The alligator came within inches of Vicki Baker, 60, of Ocala. She estimated the reptile to be nearly as long as her 10-foot paddleboard. It hissed loudly at her. She said at one point it opened its mouth, revealing large teeth and its powerful jaw as it floated on the surface. “What are you doing? Get away from me! Get away from me!” she yelled at the alligator as it swam inches from her paddleboard. “No! Oh, my God, I had to push him away with my paddle!” Nearby, off camera in the video, an employee at Silver Springs State Park can be heard on a speaker advising her: “Ma’am, I’m going to suggest backing up considering you just made him pretty mad.” Baker said she remains puzzled over the encounter. She said she presumed someone else on the water had been feeding the alligator, desensitizing it to humans and helping it associate paddlers on the river with food. “I was afraid,” she said. “I’ve seen them my whole life and have never been afraid.” The encounter happened near Silver Springs, where deep springs feed the Silver River, and the water is so stunningly clear that tourists board glass-bottom boats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: The Cobb County district attorney’s office is offering warm, furry support to crime victims and staff. District Attorney Flynn Broady announced Friday that Rose, a 3-year-old black Labrador retriever, is joining the office. The victim witness unit has been working to bring Rose on board, according to a news release from the office. “The level of stress and anxiety that victims of domestic violence experience is drastically reduced with the introduction of assistance animals,” unit director Kimberly McCoy said. “It’s been a long process, but we are excited.” The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office partnered with the Pups with a Purpose program to donate the dog. Pups with a Purpose matches people held in the Forsyth County jail with volunteer citizen dog trainers and Forsyth County Animal Shelter dogs. Rose received specialized training from Rucker Dog Training to prepare her to help crime victims in court, the release said. “Child victims will have the opportunity to have Rose there to calm them down and assure them that they are in a safe place so they can tell their story and not feel afraid of what happens if they tell it,” Broady said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Board of Education has approved changing Central Middle School’s name to honor the Hawaiian princess who once owned the downtown Honolulu property. At a meeting Thursday, the board approved naming the campus Princess Ruth Ke’elikolani Middle School. School and community leaders have been trying since 2019 to rename the school. The princess’ home, Keoua Hale, once stood on the grounds of the current campus, and when she died in 1883, her property was bequeathed to Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, according to documents supporting the name change. After Pauahi’s death in 1885, the board of education purchased the property for what became Honolulu High School in 1895, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It later became Central Grammar School before it was changed briefly to Ke’elikolani School. It became Central Junior High School in 1928, then Central Intermediate School in 1932 and Central Middle School in 1997, the newspaper reports. “In the 1930s, because people couldn’t pronounce the name, they changed it back to Central,” said the school’s principal, Joseph Passantino, Hawaii News Now reports. “So the significance is huge, especially for the staff who’s dedicated over two years to give her that duty and honor.”\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: The principal at a southwestern Idaho public charter school has died due to COVID-19, the school’s board said. The school board at Heritage Community Charter School in Caldwell announced the death of Javier Castaneda in a letter to parents. The school’s website links to a GoFundMe page created Friday that said Castaneda died unexpectedly Wednesday as a result of becoming ill with COVID-19. He is survived by his wife and seven children. The school board said in the letter first reported by KTVB-TV that the school will provide counseling resources and other support for children. The school has some restrictions in place due to COVID-19. It made face masks optional. The school said on its website that it focuses on a classical liberal arts education and uses a dual Spanish-language immersion program to provide a strong foreign language emphasis.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: All 18 of the state’s job centers offering services for people searching for work are accepting in-person appointments after shifting to remote operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Department of Employment Security announced. In-person appointments began Monday at five offices in Burbank, Chicago, Joliet and North Aurora. Other centers began accepting appointments in August and in early September. Officials encouraged people to use the agency’s website to apply for unemployment benefits, search for work and use other services. Appointments, have to be made at least 24 hours in advance by calling the agency’s hotline, at (217) 558-0401, and last 20 minutes. Anyone entering an office must wear a mask and should reschedule their appointment if they feel sick or have been exposed to COVID-19. Help will still be available over the phone as the job centers reopen for in-person services.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Organizers of a planned museum about basketball great Larry Bird are starting to assemble thousands of items ahead of its expected opening next year. The museum will be part of the new Terre Haute Convention Center, which remains under construction with an anticipated completion date of March 2022. It will include items donated by Bird and others from his career with the Boston Celtics, Indiana State University and the U.S. Olympic team. The site for work on cataloging the memorabilia is being modified for security and should be ready within weeks, the Tribune-Star reports. “As other items are collected, they can be housed in one location,” memorabilia consultant Shelly Keen said. “It’s just going to make things move a little more swiftly than what it was before.” Bird grew up in the southern Indiana town of French Lick. He created excitement during his days at Indiana State in Terre Haute when he led the school to the NCAA title game in 1979, although the Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team. When the Celtics won the 1984 NBA Championship, Bird dedicated the win to Terre Haute. He was the Indiana Pacers coach and a top team executive after his playing career.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The city’s first Black police chief is facing intense opposition from some current and former officers as he works with local leaders to reform the department, including the removal of its longtime insignia that resembles a Ku Klux Klan dragon. Joel Fitzgerald said his 16-month tenure in Waterloo, a city of 67,000 with a history of racial divisions, is a “case study” for what Black police chiefs face as they seek to build community trust and hold officers to higher standards. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said the attacks were driven by misinformation and racism toward him and his boss, the city’s first Black mayor. “I don’t think there’s been any police chief in America in a small- or medium-sized department that have endured this for the reasons I have endured it, and I think the reasons have to do with race,” said Fitzgerald, who previously served as the chief of larger departments in Fort Worth, Texas, and Allentown, Pennsylvania. “This is my fourth job being the first Black police chief. I’ve dealt with pushback in other places but never so overt. Never so nonfactual.” The backlash has intensified since last fall, when the City Council began pushing to remove the department’s emblem – a winged creature known as a griffin that had adorned patches on officers’ uniforms since the 1960s. After a messy process, the council voted 5-2 last week to order the department to remove the symbol from its uniforms by the end of September.\n\nKansas\n\nLansing: A nurse who texted a co-worker a picture of a dementia patient slumped over in a wheelchair and then suggested she was responsible and deserved thanks has pleaded guilty to intentionally administering the wrong medication. The Kansas City Star reports 37-year-old Jennifer Lynn Reavis, of Atchison, is free on bond as she awaits sentencing on charges of endangerment, unlawful administration of a controlled substance and battery. She pleaded guilty to the charges Friday in Leavenworth County District Court. In May 2019, administrators with Twin Oaks Rehab Center in Lansing contacted police after discovering a patient had been getting evening medications along with the anti-anxiety drug Ativan and Benadryl when she was not supposed to receive them. “Your (sic) welcome! I hope she is asleep most of the day tomorrow,” prosecutors said Reaves wrote to an oncoming night nurse in a text that included the photograph of the victim apparently sleeping in a wheelchair. “Hint hint.” The medication caused the patient to become lethargic and be hospitalized, prosecutors say. Reavis admitted to police giving the medicine to the woman, saying she tried to wander away from the nursing home.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: On the first Saturday after a new “safety zone” law went into effect at the state’s only abortion clinic, some protesters ignored the 10-foot-wide restricted area at the entrance as they followed patients to the door, shouting and berating them. No police were present to enforce the zone meant to ensure safe access to EMW Women’s Surgical Center, where patients often must pass through shouting, jostling anti-abortion protesters waving graphic signs of fetuses. “Repent, murderer!” self-proclaimed sidewalk preacher Jesse Morrell shouted as he and others stepped inside the restricted area to follow a young woman to the door of the clinic. The city’s police department put out a statement Sunday saying it had more urgent priorities than trying to enforce the new city ordinance, which requires officers to witness a violation before they can issue a citation. Morrell, a regular protester outside EMW, said he doesn’t feel constrained by the restricted area. “The thing about these buffer zones is that if you don’t test them, they just get bigger,” he said. “Eventually the whole street will be a buffer zone if we don’t stand up for our rights.” The protests Saturday grew increasingly chaotic as more protesters arrived, swarming vehicles that pulled up to the curb to drop off patients, shouting and admonishing them as they exited.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A Louisiana-based research organization and a professor at the University of Southern Mississippi are joining forces in a research project aimed at restoring and protecting the Chandeleur Islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In a news release announcing the effort, USM noted that the islands provide habitat for gulf fish and wildlife and offer storm protection for coastal Louisiana. Led by Dr. Kelly Darnell, an assistant research professor at USM, the project is one of 20 awarded a combined $2.3 million to find ways of best managing natural resources in the Gulf, including marine mammals, shorebirds, barrier islands, seagrass and fisheries. The projects, slated to begin this month, are funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration RESTORE Science Program. The Water Institute of the Gulf, based in Baton Rouge, will be among those working with Darnell. Others include the University of Florida, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Gulf of Mexico Alliance. Darnell’s project, which relates to seagrass ecosystems along the Chandeleur Islands, was given $127,065. The project will provide usable data for restoration and long-term management of the islands.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Acadia National Park is on track for a record year, as park officials see no signs of visitation slowing down this fall. The park’s busiest year on record was 2018, when there were 3.54 million visits. This year, the number could top 4 million, Kevin Schneider, park superintendent, told the Acadia Advisory Commission. Things have taken off since 2020, which was an off year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2.67 million visits Acadia recorded in 2020 amounted to the lowest annual count the park has had since 2014, the Bangor Daily News reports. But visitation picked up significantly last fall. Since October 2020, “every single month has been a record month” for visitation, according to Adam Gibson, a social scientist for Acadia. The past 11 months have had on average 22% more visitors than the same period from the year before, he said. The park had roughly 800,000 visits last month, and Acadia has welcomed an estimated 2.75 million visitors so far in 2021. The volume of people in the park has resulted in more rescues, said Therese Picard, the park’s chief ranger. The park typically handles two dozen rescues through August of each year, she said, but there have been 50 rescues so far this year. Most of the rescues involve leg injuries of some sort.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: BP has inked a 15-year agreement with Annapolis-based CleanBay Renewables to turn poultry litter into natural gas. The partnership involves mixing poultry litter with water in a closed system known as an anaerobic digester. One of the end products is biogas, which includes methane. The biogas can be processed into renewable natural gas and used to fuel vehicles. “We have a portfolio of projects and a corporate strategy to develop 30 (facilities) across the U.S.,” said Thomas Spangler, CleanBay Renewables’ executive chairman. Among the first locations slated to receive such a facility is Westover, in Somerset County, with a groundbreaking scheduled for early in the first quarter of 2022. That is expected to be fully operational by mid-2024. Usually, such facilities employ 26 full-time employees over three shifts a day running 24 hours a day, all year. Completing a two-year construction period could also create an additional 250 jobs. According to Spangler, the initial process behind green-lighting projects started with reaching out to Somerset Economic Development Commission and county planning and zoning officials. At the state level, the company approached the Maryland Department of Commerce, state workforce agencies, and area community colleges and universities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A museum dedicated to the English colony of Plymouth and local Indigenous tribes is opening a new exhibit to mark the 400th anniversary of Thanksgiving. The Plimoth Patuxet Museums said the exhibit, entitled “We Gather Together: Thanksgiving, Gratitude, and the Making of an American Holiday,” will open Saturday. The exhibit will explore the relationship between Native Americans and English colonists to “better understand the events that led to the first Thanksgiving,” said the museum, which features a replica colonial village and reenactors in Plymouth. It will feature rarely seen artifacts from the museum’s collection, as well as art from across the centuries tracing how the New England tradition grew and emerged as a national holiday in the 19th century, the museum said. “Patuxet/Plymouth is the place where ancient traditions of gratitude in both Indigenous and European cultures merged,” the museum said in a statement. “ ‘We Gather Together’ will explore the ancient and deeply human expression of gratitude that is the bedrock of this national holiday.” The Pokanoket tribe and their sachem Massasoit shared in three days of feasting and entertainment with English colonists in the autumn of 1621, helping to inspire the holiday of gathering and giving thanks, according to the museum.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: A “Black Lives Matter” street mural painted this summer in southeastern Michigan has been defaced by vandals who covered part of it with white paint. The weekend attack in Ypsilanti left the 260-foot mural’s words “Black Lives” drenched in white paint, while the word “Matter” was untouched. Trische Duckworth, executive director of the community organization Survivors Speak, was joined Sunday by city officials and others who expressed outrage over the vandalism in the city about 35 miles southwest of Detroit. “It was an ugly display of hatred,” Duckworth said. She said that no matter who defaced the mural, the act shows that racism and white supremacy “are not a thing of the past. It’s alive and active.” City manager Frances McMullan said law enforcement is investigating the vandalism. She said in a statement that the city was “sickened by this horrible act of destruction” but that the mural would be restored. The vandals left behind the painted name of a group identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist hate group. The Ypsilanti City Council approved the mural at the entrance of a city park in February. Volunteers painted the mural and a second one in June using donated paint. Duckworth said the council is expected to discuss the defaced mural this week.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Agriculture officials in the state say they are seeing an increase in inquiries about mental health. “We are seeing a lot of despair right now, a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety,” said Meg Moynihan, who works for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture with a focus on the human side of farming. Moynihan recently put an ad on Facebook with a link to mental health help. The response caught her attention: nearly 2,500 clicks in 18 days, Minnesota Public Radio reports. “So they’re not just looking at, ‘Oh, there’s the phone number in the ad I could call,’ but they’re clicking through for more information,” Moynihan said. “And I’m hoping that’s some people who want that kind of help and support for themselves. But I’m also hoping it’s for people who might be concerned about somebody they know.” Commissioner of Agriculture Thom Petersen recently surveyed conditions in northwestern Minnesota, where the drought is taking its biggest toll on the state. “I thought I was in Arizona,” he said. “I just looked at this bare church with no grass and the graves, you know, looked like a ghost town. And I kept going, and the pastures were the worst I’ve ever seen in my life.” Peterson said he also met an 80-year-old farmer who’d just sold off all his sheep who said the situation was the worst he’s seen in his lifetime.\n\nMississippi\n\nClarksdale: The Mississippi Writers Trail has unveiled a marker for Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and short story writer Richard Ford. The marker for Ford, a Jackson native, was placed recently at the Clarksdale Carnegie Public Library. Ford won acclaim with his first two novels, “A Piece of My Heart” and “The Ultimate Good Luck.” “Our library here in little Clarksdale, Mississippi, is just so pleased to pay tribute and to honor one of the most well-known greatest writers of all times, a native Mississippian, a novelist, a short story writer, and a Pulitzer Prize Winner,” Mary Caradine, interim director of the Carnegie Public Library of Clarksdale and Coahoma County, said in a press release. “Mr. Ford’s achievements are known far and wide.” Ford’s novel “The Sportsman” was named one of TIME Magazine’s Top 100 novels published since the magazine’s inception. Ford wrote “The Sportswriter” while living in rural Coahoma County, and he used the book’s protagonist in future novels, including “Independence Day,” for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 1996. “Richard Ford is a true international author and cultural essayist who brings a rich view of the Southern experience to his readers,” Visit Mississippi Director Craig Ray said.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A federal investigation is underway after arson damaged a historic church that now serves a congregation predominantly made up of people from South Sudan. John Ham of the Kansas City office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told the Kansas City Star that authorities have determined the blaze was intentionally set, making it a federal crime. The fire was discovered about 9:15 a.m. Saturday at the building known as Harlem Baptist Church on the city’s north side. Arriving firefighters discovered the front of the building and an area of stairs going to the basement were fully engulfed in flames and determined that’s where the fire started. One firefighter had to be rescued after the stairway collapsed but was not injured. The church suffered heavy fire damage to the front and smoke and water damage elsewhere. The church, founded in 1907 as the Harlem Tabernacle Church, is the last remaining original building of a non-incorporated community known as Harlem. It now serves as a gathering place for the United Christian Fellowship. Pastor Gabriel Riak said the congregation has Black and white members, including Sudanese and Americans. He said he was grateful no one was in the building, KMBC reports. Members plan to restore the church, which sustained about $90,000 in damage, he said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Health officials are begging residents to wear masks indoors and get vaccinated against COVID-19 as hospitals face increasing strain in the absence of any statewide health mandates. Officials in Bozeman and Missoula lamented their inability to implement public health restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus after the Legislature passed several laws earlier this year curtailing the power of local health officers to implement rules such as mask requirements and limits on gathering sizes. “Now is the time when we would have mandates in place,” said D’Shane Barnett, Missoula County health officer. “Unfortunately, we have anti-health state legislators who went out of their way to make that not possible.” Lori Christensen, public health officer for Gallatin County, said the legislative changes have “complicated the scene” in terms of immediate action she can take. She said she trying to navigate “the complexity of the law,” but a mask mandate is not on the horizon. In Missoula, officials have requested 24 National Guard soldiers to assist the county in addressing its COVID-19 surge at health care facilities and in The Sleepy Inn, a facility used to quarantine unhoused people who are diagnosed with the virus or identified as close contacts. Bozeman Health has also put in a request for National Guard assistance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is one of the few in the nation that haven’t legalized cannabis use in some form, but the industry has already launched a lobbying group to help influence the rules that will regulate the industry. John Cartier, president of the Nebraska Cannabis Association, said the organization expects some form of marijuana legalization to be approved in the state in coming years, so it makes sense to be prepared, according to the Lincoln Journal Star. “It is not unreasonable to predict that some form of legalization will happen before this decade is done, and with several ballot initiatives planned for 2022, it could come as early as January 2023,” he said. Two ballot initiatives working in tandem to legalize medical marijuana were filed with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office, and a petition to legalize all uses of marijuana remains on file. Both are seeking to put the question of legalization before voters next year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A death row inmate convicted in the 1980 robbery-killing of a man for $2 is no longer eligible for capital punishment and must be resentenced, the Nevada Supreme Court said. The justices ruled Thursday that a New York court’s recent erasure of Samuel Howard’s lone conviction for a violent crime took the death penalty off the table for his Nevada murder conviction, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Howard, 73, has been on death row for nearly 40 years after being sentenced in the fatal 1980 shooting of Las Vegas dentist George Monahan during a robbery. According to the Nevada high court, the vacating of Howard’s New York conviction eliminated the one remaining aggravating circumstance making him eligible for a possible death sentence. Under a new penalty hearing for Howard, a jury would decide between on whether his sentence of life in prison would come with or without the possibility of parole. The last person executed by Nevada was Daryl Mack, in 2006 for the 1988 murder of Betty Jane May, of Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is starting a dermatology clinic to meet the unique skin care needs of people with Down syndrome. The clinic is opening Tuesday in Manchester. There are many associated skin conditions with Down syndrome, including dry skin, excessive dandruff, rashes around the mouth, acne in the groin and armpits, patchy hair loss, vitiligo, and toenail and foot fungus, Dartmouth-Hitchcock said in a news release. Down syndrome is also linked with other medical conditions such as congenital heart disease, celiac disease, chronic ear infections and thyroid disease. The clinic will consider how treatment plans will affect other medical conditions common with Down syndrome. “Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been my dream to have a dermatology clinic specifically for people with Down syndrome – to really take our time to educate and empower. We are excited to get started,” dermatologist Jillian Rork said in a news release.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: An officer safely caught a 1-month-old baby dropped off a second-floor balcony over the weekend, police said. The Hudson County prosecutor’s office said Officer Eduardo Matute was among those called to the Jersey City residence Saturday morning after reports that a man was threatening the baby. He and several officers were positioned below the second-floor balcony as the child was dangled over the balcony railing. Officials said the man dropped the infant after a lengthy standoff, and Matute caught the child. City spokesperson Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione said the child was taken to the hospital as a precaution. Mayor Steve Fulop later posted a photo on social media of the officer holding the child, who was wrapped in a white blanket. “Thankfully the baby wasn’t harmed physically,” Fulop said. Wallace-Scalcione said the man who dropped the baby was immediately arrested, and charges are pending. “Kudos to the (Jersey City Police Department) and all the officers involved for their heroics and for bringing a safe conclusion to this dangerous situation,” Prosecutor Esther Suarez said in a Twitter post.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Amid debate over the state’s system of releasing felony defendants, University of New Mexico research indicates that just under 5% of Albuquerque-area defendants awaiting trial commit violent crimes while free from jail. Findings from the university’s Institute for Social Research’s analysis of more than 10,000 felony cases in Bernalillo County also included that less than 1% of people on pretrial release were arrested for a first-degree felony while on pretrial release, the Albuquerque Journal reports. A senior state courts official said the research indicates that the vast majority of defendants don’t commit new crimes pending trial, but the top prosecutor for Bernalillo County and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said its still troubling that some defendants commit crimes while free. Administrative Office of the Courts Director Artie Pepin said the research “validates the pretrial justice improvements underway in New Mexico.” District Attorney Raul Torrez said through spokeswoman Laura Rodriguez that the few violent crimes committed by people on pretrial release are “an unacceptable price for our community to pay.” Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said it “can still be utterly devastating to a family or a community” when 5% of felony defendants commit a violent crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is taking steps to address a mounting shortage of school bus drivers. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday announced several short-term and long-term initiatives, including opening up new testing sites for commercial driver’s license applicants, expediting the testing and permitting process, and conducting outreach to law enforcement, firefighters, military and other organizations that already have trained drivers. A study by the New York Association for Pupil Transportation two years ago found that 8 in 10 school transportation directors considered driver shortages a major concern, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem. A lack of drivers can lead to delayed departures and arrivals and the cancellation of field trips and other extracurricular activities. “Our schools and public health officials have moved mountains to ensure our children receive an in-person education this year, and we are leaving no stone unturned to make sure schools have adequate bus service to bring students to school and back,” Hochul said in a statement. The state is reaching out to more than half a million existing commercial driver’s license holders in the state, including those who are currently unemployed, Hochul said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMonroe: Union County’s school board voted Monday to modify the district’s quarantine protocols to comply with state law and let the county health department lead contact tracing efforts. The move comes after the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services threatened to sue the district for overhauling contact tracing procedures and allowing most of its 7,000 quarantined students back into the classroom so long as they are not symptomatic or known to be infected with the coronavirus. “UCPS will recognize quarantines in accordance with state law of students and staff who are considered close contacts with a COVID-19-positive case,” said Kathy Heintel, a member of the board. Because it is one of a handful of districts not compelling students or staff to wear masks and does not have an online learning option, some Union County parents say the quarantines have amounted to 14 days of near-total learning loss. Roughly one-sixth of the district’s 39,000 enrolled pupils were stuck at home the week before the district substantially changed its COVID-19 protocols. Fewer than 1,700 kids were quarantined last week after the changes, a 77% weekly drop.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Regulators say the state has officially lost its status as the nation’s second-biggest oil producer. North Dakota produced just over 1 million barrels of oil per day in July, the most recent month for which data is available from the state Oil and Gas Division. The July production marks a 56,000-barrel-per-day or 5% drop from June, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Texas continues to lead the nation in oil production. The Permian Basin spans parts of New Mexico and Texas, and it’s arguably the biggest competition for North Dakota’s Bakken oil patch. The southern oil-producing region is closer to major refineries and export terminals, and it attracts significant drilling and investment within the oil and gas industry. North Dakota ranked second, behind Texas, in oil production for nine years. It lost that status to New Mexico in July. The two states had been neck and neck for several months. New Mexico had 82 rigs drilling Friday, far more than the 27 operating in North Dakota. Aside from bragging rights, a state’s position holds other implications. Rankings can affect an oil company’s ability to find investors to fund a project in a state, North Dakota regulators have said. North Dakota had surpassed Alaska to take second place in oil production in 2012.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The State Medical Board of Ohio has renewed the medical license of a doctor who drew nationwide attention and derision for claiming COVID-19 vaccines were magnetizing recipients and had a connection to 5G wireless towers. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a state-licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine, first received her license in 1984, and it had been set to expire Oct. 1, on its regular two-year basis. Tenpenny spoke to the Ohio House Health Committee in June about her false vaccine claims. She is among the 12 most prolific disseminators of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, according to research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate. An anti-vaccine activist since the 2000s, Tenpenny has called vaccines a “method of mass destruction” and “depopulation”; charges $623 for her “boot camp” to train people how to convince others to refrain from vaccination; and sells her book “Saying No to Vaccines” for $578 on Amazon. State law allows the medical board, with the votes of at least six of its 12 members, to refuse renewal of any physician for “making a false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading statement” in relation to the practice of medicine.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state on Monday scheduled its first executions since it put lethal injections on hold six years ago following a series of mishaps. Included on the list of seven executions is Julius Jones, whose case has drawn national attention. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals scheduled Jones to die Nov. 18 by lethal injection for the 1999 slaying of Edmond businessman Paul Howell, who was shot in front of his family during a carjacking. The court set the date despite a Sept. 13 recommendation by the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that Jones’ death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment without parole. The recommendation has received no decision by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who must make the final decision. Jones’ case was featured in 2018 on the ABC television documentary series “The Last Defense.” That drew the attention of reality television star Kim Kardashian West and numerous professional athletes with ties to Oklahoma, who appealed for clemency. Jones, 41, has consistently maintained that he is innocent of the killing. Oklahoma once had one of the busiest death chambers in the nation, but executions were put on hold following a botched lethal injection in 2014 that left an inmate writhing on the gurney and drug mix-ups in 2015.\n\nOregon\n\nDallas: The Oregon Medical Board has revoked the license of a doctor west of Salem for refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines in his office, spreading misinformation about masks and overprescribing opioids. According to medical board documents, the board also fined Steven Arthur LaTulippe $10,000 on Sept. 2, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. LaTulippe sued the medical board in January after his license was suspended for placing patients in danger by disregarding COVID-19 mandates and asking patients to remove their masks. LaTulippe’s family practice, South View Medical Arts in Dallas, did not properly screen patients and relied on the receptionist’s ability to visually gauge whether visitors were sick, according to the medical board documents. At least 95% of patients did not use masks at the clinic between March and December 2020, LaTulippe told medical board officials. LaTulippe made bogus claims to patients that masks were ineffective against COVID-19 and could cause carbon dioxide poisoning, according to the medical board. LaTulippe also made anti-mask comments during a pro-Trump rally in Salem on Nov. 7, 2020. The Multnomah County Republican Party posted footage of his comments to YouTube, which removed the video for violating its community guidelines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Supporters of a plan to open supervised injection sites to try to reduce overdose deaths urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to review a court decision that bans the practice. The test case centers on a nonprofit group’s Safehouse project in Philadelphia, though officials in other states are watching closely as they debate similar programs. Nationally, more than 93,000 people died last year from drug overdoses, a sharp spike from just a year earlier. A divided U.S. appeals court had rejected the Safehouse plan in January, although Philadelphia’s Democratic mayor and top prosecutor endorse it. The city itself lost 1,200 people to overdoses last year. The nonprofit group’s plan to open a site was thwarted when former U.S. Attorney William McSwain, a Trump appointee now running for governor, argued that it violated a 1980s-era drug law aimed at “crackhouses.” The district judge rejected McSwain’s argument, but the appeals court agreed with him in a 2-1 decision that nonetheless called the goal of harm reduction “admirable.” Safehouse last month asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review that decision. The amicus brief filed Friday said Congress never intended the crackhouse statute to encompass harm reduction efforts offered by medical personnel.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is offering $4 million in grants to help communities build and expand recreation facilities. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee and the Department of Environmental Management announced Friday that the outdoor recreation matching grants would be available to local municipalities and Native American tribes seeking to acquire, develop or renovate outdoor recreational facilities in their communities. Grant applications are due by Dec. 17. The money is provided through a clean water and green bond approved by voters. McKee said the state’s network of bikeways, open spaces and other recreational assets help attract people and businesses to Rhode Island. “Access to green space and clean, functional recreation facilities improves health, promotes stronger social ties, and enhances neighborhood satisfaction and pride,” McKee said in a statement. Applicants can apply for smaller recreation development grants or larger acquisition grants, capped at $400,000.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: A school board will consider asking the Legislature to drop what amounts to a ban on school mask mandates to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The State newspaper reports the Lexington County School District 1 board surveyed parents recently and found more than two-thirds supported a mask mandate. A similar percentage of district employees also backed a mandate. At its Tuesday board meeting, Lexington 1 board will consider asking lawmakers to repeal a part of the state budget that effectively bans school mask mandates by denying districts the funds to enforce them. “For months, we have heard from a small and vocal group of parents and staff on both sides of the mask debate,” school board chair Anne Marie Green said in an email to parents. “We wanted to know how our entire community truly felt about masking.” Green told The State she isn’t sure if the board would adopt a mask mandate immediately “because our numbers are going in the right direction.” However, she said the local school board is better positioned to respond to sudden changes than the Legislature, which won’t hold a regular session until early next year. The S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control reported 2,357 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and 17 coronavirus-related deaths Monday, according to the paper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Musicals scheduled in the state’s two largest cities have been postponed or scrapped due to the pandemic. A show that was set to run this past weekend at the Orpheum Theater in Sioux Falls was postponed to Sept.29-30 after two cast members tested positive for the coronavirus. The production of “Lost in Vegas,” held by local theater company Lights Up, held its opening run last weekend in front of about 200 people each day. After one cast member had tested positive for the virus this past week, the show went on Thursday after officials blocked the first two rows and warned the 150 people in the audience about the results, director Brent Grosvenor said. “We did the right thing. We talked to the cast. The cast made an informed decision still to perform,” Grosvenor said. “We had understudies replacing sick actors, and that’s how the real world works.” After another cast member tested positive for the virus Friday, theater officials called off the rest of the weekend shows. In Rapid City, the Black Hills Community Theatre announced Friday that it had canceled all planned performances of “Matilda” following the increased spread of COVID-19 infections in the region. Theater officials told the Rapid City Journal many younger participants in the show are not yet eligible for vaccinations.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: State officials say donors have added 144 acres to a state park known for being the first east of the Mississippi River to be open to African Americans. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said the expansion of T.O. Fuller State Park is the result of a donation by philanthropists Hugh and Margaret Jones Fraser and the Carrington Jones family of Memphis. Nonprofits groups The Land Trust for Tennessee and Wolf River Conservancy helped with the acquisition. The park, opened in 1938, was also only the second state park nationwide that was open to African Americans. In 1942 the park was named after Thomas O. Fuller, a prominent African American educator, pastor, politician, civic leader and author. The park includes 8 miles of trails, four shelters, 35 picnic tables, basketball courts, an interpretive center, and diverse landscapes with more than 200 plant species.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A doctor who said he performed an abortion in defiance of a new state law has all but dared supporters of the near-total ban on the procedure to try making an early example of him by filing a lawsuit – the only way the restrictions can be enforced. The state’s largest anti-abortion group said Monday that it’s looking into the matter after Dr. Alan Braid in a weekend Washington Post opinion column became the first Texas abortion provider to publicly reveal he violated the law that took effect Sept. 1. The law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually around six weeks and before many women even know they are pregnant. Prosecutors cannot take criminal action against Braid, because the law explicitly forbids that. The only way the ban can be enforced is through lawsuits brought by private citizens, who are entitled to claim at least $10,000 in damages if successful. Legal experts say Braid’s admission is likely to set up another test of whether the law can stand after the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect. Braid wrote that on Sept. 6 he provided an abortion to a woman who was still in her first trimester but beyond the state’s new limit. “I fully understood that there could be legal consequences – but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested,” he wrote.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s newest license plate option features an outline of Utah and five hands of different colors holding it into place. The words “many stories, one Utah” are printed underneath, the Deseret News reports. Gov. Spencer Cox said he hopes someone will see it and think about what it represents. “I hope and believe because of the incredible artwork that it will inspire conversations,” Cox said. The new license plate unveiled at the state Capitol on Thursday honors the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr. While there are no direct links to his image or likeness – as a result of legal reasons from the King estate – the design itself is inspired by him and his work as a civil rights activist before he was assassinated in 1968. Utah’s work toward an MLK-themed license plate dates back to 2012, according to Simba Maponga, chairman of the state’s Martin Luther King Jr. Human Rights Commission. A 2020 bill led by Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, then paved the way for a license plate to recognize King’s work and life, with money from the plates going toward scholarships for “underrepresented or underserved” students. The winning design was submitted by Eleanor Smith, a former Timpview High School and current BYU student.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The city’s hospital is seeking approval to build a $7.5 million expansion of its emergency department. The Northwestern Medical Center has been considering an upgrade to its emergency department, which was built around 1989, since before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said Jonathan Billings, the hospital’s vice president of community relations. COVID-19 has clearly exacerbated the need, Billing’s told the St. Albans Messenger earlier this month. The emergency room currently has curtained treatment bays to separate patients. “If you have someone with active COVID-19, you can’t put them in a curtained treatment bay,” he said. The expansion would eliminate such use by updating those areas to increase patient privacy and safety and to better limit the spread of infectious airborne diseases, such as the coronavirus, through additional air quality-controlled rooms, Billings told the newspaper. The expansion would add six emergency department treatment stations, bringing the total to 20. About 2,400 square feet would be added, and 6,800 square feet of existing space would be renovated.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A Republican candidate for the House of Delegates has apologized after tweeting a derogatory comment about the appearance of House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn that some Democrats said was an antisemitic attack. The Washington Post reports that Hahns Copeland, who is running to represent the Norfolk-based 89th District, on Friday tweeted a response to a tweet by House Democrats that featured a video of Filler-Corn, who is Jewish, talking about a child care subsidy program. “I was surprised to see a pair of eyes and a mouth with that NOSE,” Copeland tweeted. He apologized in another tweet late Friday, calling the earlier tweet “immature and impulsive.” “It was never intended to be anti-Semitic or reference her ethnicity or religion,” Copeland’s tweet said. He conceded his earlier tweet was “inappropriate and insensitive.” Democrats said it was an antisemitic attack on Filler-Corn. The speaker’s staff said Friday that she had not heard directly from Copeland. “These types of hateful comments are unfortunately far too common today, and they are too often invoked instead of solutions to the real issues Virginians face,” Filler-Corn said in a statement. “I hope this candidate and his supporters choose to do what is right and acknowledge that words from those in office or seeking it have an impact.”\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: This has been a record-breaking year of drought in much of Eastern Washington, state officials say. In April, a huge volume of snow in the Cascade Range measured in at 132% of normal statewide, raising hopes of an abundant water year, the state Department of Ecology said in a blog post last week. But now 16 Washington counties, including 13 in Eastern Washington, are drier than they’ve ever been since record-keeping began in 1895, the blog said. According to the National Weather Service, from March to August the state saw just 6.90 inches of precipitation. Normal during that time is 13.03 inches. To end the current drought in the lower Columbia River area, Ecology Drought Coordinator Jeff Marti said the state would need 11 inches of rain by next April. The odds of that kind of rebound are low. “The question is, will we have a full recovery before next spring?” Marti said. “The odds for significant improvement of conditions are pretty good for Western Washington. But I’m less optimistic about the east side. Based on historic climatology, the odds for significantly ameliorating current conditions is about 1 in 5 across Eastern Washington. For a full recovery in Eastern Washington, the odds are about 1 in 20,” Marti said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A grassroots group is using newspaper advertisements to further push Sen. Joe Manchin to support issues it considers important to low-income West Virginians. The Poor People’s Campaign took out the full-page ads Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, The Herald-Dispatch in Huntington, The Parkersburg News and Sentinel and The Journal of Martinsburg. The group has repeatedly pressed the influential moderate Democratic senator in an effort that includes conducting a rally at the state Capitol in Charleston last month. Manchin has opposed a $15 federal minimum wage and an elections bill that he said he couldn’t support because it lacked bipartisan support. Senate Democrats unveiled a pared-back elections bill last week. The Poor People’s Campaign also had a news conference scheduled Monday to urge Manchin to help change Senate filibuster rules that have blocked passage of legislation. Scheduled participants include state organizers as well as the group’s national co-chairs. Manchin long has defended the filibuster as many of his Senate colleagues have shifted on the issue.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The retired conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election released a video Monday threatening to subpoena election officials who don’t comply and saying the intent was not to overturn President Joe Biden’s relatively narrow victory in the battleground state. The unusual 6-minute video from Michael Gableman comes after election clerks were confused by an email his office sent last week that was flagged in at multiple counties as junk or a possible security risk and was not broadly forwarded to municipal clerks as he wanted. Gableman said Monday that if the state’s 1,900-plus municipal and county election officials did not cooperate with his investigation, he would “compel” them to comply. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has said he would sign subpoenas requested by Gableman as part of the investigation. Vos hired Gableman at a cost of nearly $680,000 in taxpayer money to conduct the investigation. Vos declined to sign subpoenas sought by Rep. Janel Bandtjen, chair of the Assembly elections committee, seeking ballots, voting machines and other data in Milwaukee and Brown counties. Gableman said local clerks who run elections in Wisconsin will be required to prove that voting was done legally.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city is considering offering employees a $250 incentive for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. City workers could also get $100 for dependents or spouses who get their inoculations, as well as $50 for booster shots, and the employees themselves would be eligible retroactively if they’ve already gotten their shots, according to the paper. The proposal is set to be considered at a City Council meeting Tuesday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/10/time-capsule-eyes-texas-pebble-mine-news-around-states/118805644/", "title": "Time capsule, 'Eyes of Texas': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state said it will allow a death row inmate’s pastor to hold his hand during a lethal injection next month, a decision that was made to end litigation over the issue. Lawyers for Alabama wrote in a June court document that inmates can now have a personal spiritual adviser present with them in the execution chamber, and the adviser will be allowed to touch them. The agreement settled litigation over Willie Smith’s request to have his personal pastor with him as he is put to death. Smith was convicted of the 1991 kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham. Alabama has rescheduled Smith’s execution for next month. According to court documents, his spiritual adviser can anoint the inmate’s head with oil; pray with the inmate and hold his hand as the execution begins, as long as the adviser steps away before the consciousness assessment is performed; and remain in the execution chamber until the curtains to the witness rooms are drawn. The description was included in a footnote in a joint filing in June by the state and Smith’s attorneys in which the two sides announced they had reached an agreement over the spiritual adviser issue.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it would seek to restart a process that could restrict mining in the Bristol Bay region, renowned for its salmon runs. The announcement is the latest in a long-running dispute over a proposed copper-and-gold mine in the southwest Alaska region. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in November 2020, under the Trump administration, denied key authorization for the proposed Pebble Mine following an environmental review from the agency months earlier that the developer had viewed as a favorable to the project. In the rejection decision, a Corps official concluded the project would “result in significant degradation of the aquatic ecosystem” and was “contrary to the public interest.” The Pebble Limited Partnership, the mine developer owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., is appealing that determination. “As the Biden Administration seeks lower carbon emissions for energy production, they should recognize that such change will require significantly more mineral production – notably copper,” Mike Heatwole, a Pebble partnership spokesperson, said in an email. “The Pebble Project remains an important domestic source for the minerals necessary for the administration to reach its green energy goals.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A program announced by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last month to give private school vouchers to parents who object to campus mask requirements has seen applications surge, with twice as many either started or completed as can be funded with the $10 million in federal coronavirus relief earmarked for the plan. And GOP lawmakers who back expansion of the state’s existing voucher program doubt any students who receive the grants will be forced back into public schools when the federal cash is exhausted. Opponents of the school voucher program suspect that is highly likely. The program Ducey created will give $7,000 per school year to each student who enrolled in a public school that either has mask requirements or requires unvaccinated children exposed to the coronavirus to quarantine or isolate differently from vaccinated children. Applicants can earn up to 350% of the federal poverty level, which equals $92,750 for a family of four. They can use the money for private school tuition, tutoring or other costs. The governor’s education policy adviser said last week that applications for 454 children had been completed and another 2,255 started in the first 13 days the application window was open, with 69 approved.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is easing rules for its rental relief program to prioritize the funds for tenants at immediate risk of being evicted. Little of the state’s share of the federal money has been spent so far. Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the changes to the Arkansas Rent Relief Program on Wednesday after asking the state Department of Human Services to review its processes surrounding the program. Arkansas set aside $173 million in federal funds for the program for people who have lost jobs or are struggling financially because of the pandemic. So far, though, only $9.8 million in assistance has been paid out. DHS said nearly 2,800 applicants are at immediate risk of eviction, and 51% of those will be prioritized under the changes. The remainder have been paid or are expected to be paid by next week. The other changes will also allow funds to be paid to eligible tenant applicants if a landlord does not submit the required information within 10 days. DHS said the contractor handling the program is also adding 70 staffers to handle calls and process cases, and a new case management team has been added to focus on previously submitted applications in which the landlord did not submit the required information.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers on Wednesday sent Gov. Gavin Newsom legislation to end the careers of bad law enforcement officers, a year after an earlier effort died without a final vote. The measure aims to keep troubled officers from jumping from one job to another by creating a mandatory new state license, or certification, that could be permanently revoked. “This bill allows them to rid the bad apples that we know exist, bad apples that we know exist in every profession,” Democratic Sen. Steven Bradford said. “Just because you put on a uniform and a badge doesn’t absolve you or make you immune to being a bad person.” California licenses more than 200 professions, he noted – “we’re just adding law enforcement to that category.” The final, softened version of the legislation also allows for suspending the license as a lesser punishment and includes other safeguards like requiring a two-thirds vote for decertification. Senators gave final approval on a 28-9 vote, with Republicans opposed. California is one of just four states without a way of decertifying officers, alongside Hawaii, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Bradford named his bill the Kenneth Ross Jr. Police Decertification Act, after a 25-year-old Black man killed in Los Angeles County in 2018 by an officer who had previously been involved in three other shootings.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: The city announced Wednesday that it has agreed to pay $3 million to a woman with dementia who was roughly arrested by police last year after being suspected of shoplifting. Her family said the money will pay for the around-the-clock care she has needed after her condition deteriorated following her arrest. Then-Officer Austin Hopp arrested Karen Garner, 73, after she left a store without paying for $13.88 worth of items in Loveland, about 50 miles north of Denver, in June 2020. Police body camera video shows that after she turned away from him, he grabbed her arm and pushed her to the ground, with her still holding the wildflowers she had been picking as she walked through a field. A federal lawsuit that Garner filed claimed he dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of a patrol car. Police station surveillance video also showed Hopp and others officers talking about the arrest and the “pop” sound her arm made, laughing and joking at times as Garner sat in a holding cell. Officials in Loveland apologized to Garner and her family in the announcement of the proposed settlement and listed the steps they have taken in response to her arrest, including a pending independent investigation and changes to how cases are reviewed when police use force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMontville: Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that his administration plans to close the Radgowski Correctional Center at the end of this year. The prison, part of the two-building Corrigan-Radgowski complex, is the second of three closures that were planned as part of budget cuts for the 2022-23 fiscal year. The move is expected to save the state $7.3 million, the governor’s office said. The state shuttered the maximum-security Northern Correctional Institution in June, a move expected to save about $11.75 million annually. The governor’s office has not announced the name of the third facility it plans to close or when that will happen. “Spending millions of dollars in annual operating costs on buildings that have historically low numbers of incarcerated individuals inside is just not a good use of resources,” Lamont, a Democrat, said in a statement. “By relocating them to other facilities that have available capacity, we can deliver on our administration’s goal of reducing the cost structure of state government.” The closures come during a steady decline in the inmate population, which has decreased by more than 3,200 over the past 17 months. The state currently houses about 9,200 prisoners, down from the all-time high of 19,894 in February 2008.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro: About 30,000 gallons of diesel fuel were spilled at NRG Energy’s power plant on the Indian River near Millsboro overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday. The spill, discovered Wednesday morning, occurred after a pressurized hose detached and was contained to NRG property, according to a statement from the company. Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control spokeswoman Nikki Lavoie said the hose detached from an above-ground storage tank, and the fuel was released into “a contained outside area.” Lavoie said Tri-State Bird Rescue was contacted “to assist with the wildlife impacts from the spill,” including “affected geese on the property and seagulls that had flown into the area.” No waterways or public lands were affected by the spill, according to NRG spokesman Dave Schrader. He said the spill was contained to “the coal pile.” “NRG takes protection of the environment and compliance with all environmental regulations seriously,” Schrader said. DNREC, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continue to monitor cleanup. NRG announced earlier this year that the coal-fired Millsboro plant will close in June 2022.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown could soon be getting a Metro station, WUSA-TV reports. A two-year study commissioned by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to address overcrowding on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines presented six options for extended rail service on the lines, which have exceeded capacity limits during peak hours for years, according to Metro. The study, launched in 2019, identified a preferred Blue line route that would extend the line to National Harbor by way of a second Rosslyn station, a new Potomac River tunnel and a new station at Georgetown. The study predicts cities and counties along Metro rail lines will add 37% more people and 30% more jobs by 2040, noting that large rail projects can take up to 20 years to complete. Metro said in its report that the expansion would cost between $20 billion and $25 billion to build and between $175 million and $200 million annually to operate, but of the six options, the National Harbor expansion would create the biggest ridership growth – one of the main goals of the study. Metro board members planned to meet Thursday to discuss the results of the study.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A chance encounter with a former Marine beset by delusions of child sex trafficking ultimately led to the massacre of four members of a family, including a mother holding her baby boy, a sheriff said Thursday. Bryan Riley, who faces murder and other charges in Sunday’s killings, stopped by the slain family’s Lakeland home briefly the day before after going to a nearby friend’s house to pick up a first aid kit, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference. Riley had told acquaintances he was headed for Hurricane Ida relief work. A short distance from the friend’s home, Riley saw Justice Gleason mowing his lawn with his 11-year-old daughter in the yard, Judd said. That provided the trigger that led to the slayings, Judd said: Riley believed she was an imaginary child named Amber who was suicidal and being held by a supposed sex trafficking ring that God had told him to confront. No one named Amber lived at the home, as Gleason repeatedly told Riley before asking him to leave their initial encounter. “This was all fiction, all made up by him,” Judd said. Riley, wearing body armor, had three weapons with him and fired at least 100 shots in the main home and a smaller one in back. An 11-year-old girl who played dead survived the attack despite being shot multiple times and has undergone four surgeries so far, Judd said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s public safety net hospital became the latest to temporarily cancel elective surgeries Wednesday, saying it’s being overrun with COVID-19 patients. Grady Memorial Hospital CEO John Haupert made the announcement, saying the hospital was “inundated” with patients over the Labor Day weekend even though it was officially diverting ambulances. “Because of the strain this is putting on the health system, our patients, and our staff, we must make some changes to the way we operate,” Haupert wrote. “As of today, we are canceling non-essential outpatient surgery and procedures. We will regularly review patient volumes to determine when we can resume those services.” More than 5,900 people sickened by the respiratory illness were in Georgia hospitals Wednesday. COVID-19 patient numbers have been hovering around 6,000, a record high, for more than a week. Across the state, 97% of intensive care beds were in use Wednesday, an all-time high. Some other Georgia hospitals were already postponing elective surgeries, as more than 50 hospitals statewide Wednesday reported they were turning away ambulances bringing emergency or ICU patients.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is launching a program that will allow people to use their smartphones to prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Hawaii Smart Health Card comes shortly before Honolulu and Maui begin instituting vaccine requirements for patrons of restaurants and other businesses. State officials say that starting Friday, people who have been vaccinated in Hawaii will be able to upload a photo of their vaccination card to the Safe Travels Hawaii website to create a digital vaccination record. The website will cross-check this information with data stored in the state’s vaccination database. Gov. David Ige said this should help prevent the use of fake vaccination cards. The verification process should only take a few seconds. Customers may show restaurants, museums and other establishments their verified Hawaii Smart Health Card in lieu of their paper vaccination card to gain admittance. Businesses will have the option to use a validator app to scan a QR code on the digital vaccination records to verify their legitimacy. “Participation in the Hawaii Smart Health Card is voluntary. It is strictly a convenience for those residents who have been vaccinated here in the state of Hawaii,” Ige said at a news conference.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Scientists studying pack rat middens at the City of Rocks National Reserve have determined that the area’s iconic pinyon pine trees first arrived about 2,800 years ago and became prevalent about 700 years ago. That’s just one example of what scientists have learned by studying the middens – piles of seeds, bones, leaves and waste – in the area that date back 45,000 years. Julio Betancourt of the U.S. Geological Survey has studied pack rat middens in the U.S. West and South America. “They’re hard as a rock, kind of black, big chunks, sometimes huge chunks of pack rat deposits that have been consolidated, cemented by the crystalized urine of pack rats,” Betancourt told the Post Register. “The pack rats are just collecting tons of stuff and don’t go very far to collect it – mostly within 50 meters . The spatial resolution is really high. We’ve studied all kinds of things in these deposits. The principal thing is plant remains.” The middens can be dated, giving a snapshot of the local ecology over time. The U.S. Geological Survey keeps a database of pack rat middens for western North America. One midden from the area dated to about 10,000 years ago is on display at the City of Rocks visitor center in Almo. Betancourt said the middens have allowed scientists to track climate and vegetation changes at the City of Rocks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge has granted class-action status in a lawsuit filed six years ago that alleged the Chicago Police Department’s stop-and-frisk policy targeted Black and Hispanic people who hadn’t committed any crime. Attorneys involved in the lawsuit announced Tuesday that the case’s six original plaintiffs are now part of a class of more than 1 million people. The plaintiffs’ lawyers say some 2 million unconstitutional stops occurred in Chicago between 2010 and 2017 in which officers allegedly had no “reasonable suspicion” that a crime had been or was about to be committed. The decision was handed down by U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood on Aug. 31. The ruling, which could lead to a trial, comes at a difficult time for a police department that has long been plagued by a legacy of excessive force and racism and has scrambled to restore public trust. “This practice has to stop – and elevating this issue to a class action provides a way to make significant change and make our community better,” Antonio Romanucci, an attorney who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. In fact, the judge limited her ruling only to the possibility of a change in policy, according to Jennifer McGuffin, a spokeswoman for Romanucci’s firm.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s ban on telemedicine consultations between doctors and women seeking abortions and several other abortion restrictions are back in force after a federal appeals court set aside a judge’s ruling that they were unconstitutional. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel issued a 2-1 ruling Wednesday that allows Indiana to continue enforcing those laws while the court considers a full appeal of the case. It said District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker’s ruling last month was inconsistent with previous Supreme Court decisions and reinstated Indiana’s telemedicine ban, along with state laws requiring in-person examinations by a doctor before medication-induced abortions can be performed and a prohibition on second-trimester abortions outside hospitals or surgery centers. “Plaintiffs contend, and the district court found, that developments in videoconferencing make it possible to dispense with in-person meetings, that improvements in medicine make the use of hospitals or surgical centers unnecessary, and that nurses are competent to approve and monitor medication-induced abortions,” the ruling said. “The district court concluded that these findings permit it to depart from the holdings of earlier cases. Yet the Supreme Court insists that it alone has the authority to modify its precedents.”\n\nIowa\n\nWinterset: More than 100 students walked out of Winterset Junior High and Winterset High School this week in protest over the school district placing seventh grade literacy teacher Lucas Kaufmann on leave after a presentation about himself to his class featured the LGBT pride flag, according to a change.org petition. When asked by students, Kaufmann said he was bisexual. More than 2,500 people had signed the online petition as of Thursday afternoon. Winterset Community School District Superintendent Justin Gross confirmed Kaufmann was placed on leave after concerns were raised following the presentation but declined further comment. State law prohibits employers from firing employees based on sexual orientation and gender identification, which Gross acknowledged. Kaufmann did not respond to a request for comment. His presentation and personnel status were the subject of a report by the Iowa Standard, a conservative website. Students standing outside the school building during the protest said having teachers who share similar experiences can help them navigate their own identities. And they worried what the district’s decision would mean for LGBTQ students, especially those who are not publically out.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A plan to allocate up to $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to retention incentives for nurses and front-line workers has stalled because of top Republican legislators’ concerns about which hospitals would receive the money and how the funds would be spent. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s bipartisan pandemic response advisory task force delayed approving the proposal after a top Republican legislator argued that it should allow hospitals to use the funds to address other pandemic-related issues including mental health. And another Republican leader on the task force on Wednesday proposed excluding hospitals that require all of their employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The task force expects to meet again by early next week to consider a revised version of the plan. It would have to sign off on the details before the funds could be spent. The retention incentives would be capped at $13 an hour and $25,000 a year to comply with federal requirements. Workers would need to have been hired at a hospital as of September to qualify for the retention pay. Senate President Ty Masterson’s proposal to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Officials say they’ve reached a milestone at a chemical weapons depot with the destruction of all projectiles containing mustard agent. The last projectiles containing mustard agent were destroyed Saturday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant in Madison County, the facility said in a statement this week. The U.S. is destroying its chemical weapons stockpile under an international treaty. Mustard and nerve agent are being destroyed at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky, while mustard agent is being destroyed at a Colorado facility. The chemical weapons stockpile at the Kentucky site originally contained 523 tons of chemical agent configured in 155 mm projectiles containing mustard and VX nerve agent, 8-inch projectiles containing GB nerve agent, and M55 rockets containing GB and VX nerve agent. The last of Kentucky’s projectiles containing VX nerve agent were destroyed in May. Now that the mustard agent projectiles are gone, only rockets are left to destroy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A young giraffe named for a Louisiana football star has died at the Baton Rouge Zoo, officials said Thursday. In a news release, the zoo said the 20-month-old giraffe named Burreaux – after Cincinnati Bengals quarterback and former LSU star Joe Burrow – died early Wednesday. The zoo said Burreaux fell ill Tuesday with a sudden onset of symptoms including a severe cough and overall agitation. “The Zoo’s veterinary staff took immediate measures to help, including swiftly administering medications to stabilize,” the statement said. “As well, he underwent constant staff evaluation to optimize his chances of recovery. The Zoo’s team reached out to numerous zoological veterinarians throughout the nation – none of which had experienced a giraffe with comparable symptoms.” The zoo said an LSU veterinary team has performed a necropsy to determine the possible cause of death. The official results are expected in about 30 days.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Opponents of a proposal to replace the state’s private utility companies with a consumer-owned utility have crafted a referendum that could create a hurdle to issuing bonds to fund the effort. The referendum proposal submitted to the secretary of state’s office Tuesday would require voter approval for any quasi-government entity, including a consumer-owned utility, to take on $1 billion or more in debt. It also requires voters to be presented with the full accounting of the cost. “The principle is straightforward: You should know how much something is going to cost before you commit to borrowing billions of dollars to buy it,” said Willy Ritch from Maine Affordable Energy. Groups that want to buy out Central Maine Power and Versant power and create a consumer utility called Pine Tree Power also are pressing for a referendum after Gov. Janet Mills vetoed their bill. The effort came at a time of frustration with CMP, the state’s largest electric utility, over a botched rollout of a billing system, slow response to storm damage and power outages, and a controversial utility corridor that would serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. It’s possible both the proposals could appear on the ballot at the same time next year. Both petitions are pending with the secretary of state’s office.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is authorizing COVID-19 booster shots for all residents 65 and older who live in congregate care settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday. Residents in nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, residential drug treatment centers and developmentally disabled group homes are eligible for boosters, the governor said. “To be clear, these facilities in Maryland will not have to wait to begin offering boosters,” Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference. “Boosters can now be immediately administered.” While the federal government has yet to say when most people should get booster shots, Hogan said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has approved them for people who are immunocompromised, and a Maryland study indicates many in those facilities are immunocompromised. “So we’re following CDC guidance but broadening the definition,” Hogan said. The governor also announced that the state’s health department is issuing new guidance for pharmacies and other vaccine providers across the state to administer boosters without any need of a prescription or doctor’s order to anyone who considers themselves to be immunocompromised.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A strike by nurses at St. Vincent Hospital hit the six-month mark Wednesday, an anniversary the nurses called “sad” and hospital CEO Carolyn Jackson called “unbelievable,” as the sides traded blame. “The fact that we are still outside this hospital, the hospital we love and have served, some of us for 10, 20, even 40 years is a travesty and serves as an indictment of (hospital owners) Tenet Healthcare and their unyielding desire for profit and power at the expense of the suffering of our patients and our community,” Marlena Pellegrino, a longtime nurse at the hospital and co-chair of the nurses local bargaining unit of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, said in a statement Tuesday. Jackson blamed the nurses union. “It’s truly unbelievable that the MNA has prolonged a strike that was based on false pretenses for six months,” she said in an interview Wednesday. While the strike initially focused primarily on staffing – with nurses alleging unsafe levels and the hospital saying such charges are false – the hospital and nurses are now stymied by a return-to-work agreement. Nurses want a provision that would enable them to return to their old jobs and proposed a $2,000 bonus for striking and nonstriking nurses in recognition of their work during the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Ten sexual assault victims sued the University of Michigan on Thursday over a policy that limits the number of people who can offer public comment at meetings of the school’s governing board. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of nine men and a woman who said they were molested by Dr. Robert Anderson during his decades as a campus physician. They said they were denied an opportunity to address the Board of Regents in July, in violation of Michigan’s open meetings law. The university caps the number of speakers and limits the number of people who can talk about a specific topic at five. Regents have been meeting by video conference during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2017, The number of speakers was increased to as many as 17, under certain conditions, from 10. Five people who said they were assaulted by Anderson spoke in July, spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said. Regents have the “authority to establish rules by which members of the public may address a meeting of the board, and the process in place at U-M is consistent with those at other Michigan public universities,” Fitzgerald said. Hundreds of men say they were molested by Anderson, who died in 2008, while he served for decades as a university doctor. The university has acknowledged assaults occurred and is in mediation to settle lawsuits.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said Wednesday that he will no longer prosecute felony charges stemming from most low-level traffic stops, saying it’s time to change a practice that has disproportionately affected generations of minority communities. “Recognizing the role we play as prosecutors in perpetuating racial inequities that often result from these types of stops is an important first step in charting a new, less harmful course,” Choi said in a statement. Choi said his office will not prosecute crimes that are discovered solely because of a low-level traffic stop, such as broken taillight or expired license tabs. He said the new policy does not apply to situations that create a public safety hazard or when a vehicle is stopped because of a dangerous condition. Choi said during a news conference that he used to believe that pretextual stops – in which police use a minor violation as a reason to pull someone over and search for a more serious crime – amounted to good policing. “I no longer believe that,” he said, adding that such stops seldom result in seized contraband. And sometimes the consequences can be fatal, as seen in a series of encounters in recent years in Ramsey County and elsewhere.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is closing its only remaining parking garage field hospital set up to treat coronavirus patients during the delta variant surge, but it is still relying on out-of-state workers to help increase intensive care unit capacity in state hospitals, officials said Wednesday. Health officials also reported the state’s seventh child death from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic and raised alarms about a string of deaths in unvaccinated pregnant women. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said eight pregnant women with the coronavirus have died over the past four weeks. “We do know that COVID is especially problematic and dangerous for pregnant women,” he said. Dobbs said COVID-19 can be deadly for babies in the womb, too. Very preliminary data collected by the Department of Health indicates babies are twice as likely to die in the womb after 20 weeks in coronavirus-infected pregnant women than in women without the virus, he said. “It’s been a real tragedy,” he said. Jim Craig, senior deputy for the Mississippi Department of Health and Director of Health Protection, said the state is seeing a small improvement in hospital bed availability, but ICU capacity continues to be “very scarce ... effectively zero.”\n\nMissouri\n\nNeosho: A teacher said he resigned from Neosho Junior High School after he was told to remove a gay pride flag from his classroom and to sign a letter saying he would not discuss human sexuality or gender with his students. John Wallis, 22, said he hung the flag and a sign that said “everyone is welcome” in his classroom so his students would know they could come to him for help, The Kansas City Star reports. Superintendent Jim Cummins said in a statement that he could not discuss personnel matters. He said Wallis, a theater, world mythology and speech and debate teacher, was hired Aug. 13 and resigned Sept. 1. Wallis said he took down the flag and sign after being told a parent complained. He said he was told more parents complained after he told students they should consider finding another classroom if they were uncomfortable with him or LGBTQ students. He said he was then asked to sign a letter saying he would be fired if he could not teach his curriculum without keeping his “personal agenda on sexuality” out of the classroom. Wallis said he’s filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An area of the city contaminated with dry cleaning chemicals that emit toxic vapors has been added to the federal government’s Superfund list of cleanup sites. The move makes the Billings PCE site eligible for federal money for permanent cleanup. Solvents from old dry cleanings businesses in Billings created an underground plume that stretches for miles, the Billings Gazette reports. Employees of businesses near one of the dry cleaners have complained of feeling sick because of exposure to PCE, a solvent used to remove stains that’s been linked to liver and some other cancers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The area was declared a state Superfund site in 1992. Over the next year, workers from the EPA and Montana Department of Environmental Quality will investigate which buildings have been contaminated and outline cleanup options.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have announced the procession route through the city for a Marine who died in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The body of 23-year-old Cpl. Daegan Page will be transported starting at 1:30 p.m. Friday from Eppley Airfield in Omaha to Braman Mortuary in southwest Omaha, police said. The procession will begin at Abbott Drive, then head south on 10th Street before traveling over I-480 west and I-80 west. The procession will exit I-80 at L Street and head south on 132nd Street and Millard Avenue South before continuing to Millard Avenue and 144th Street south to the funeral home. Officials have encouraged the public to line the streets of the route to pay their respects to the fallen Marine. Page was one of 13 U.S. service members killed Aug. 26 in the bombing at the Kabul airport, which also killed at least 169 Afghans. A memorial service will be held the morning of Sept. 17 at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in Millard. Page will be buried in Omaha National Cemetery.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: All 17 counties in the state were expected to be subject to an indoor mask mandate by Friday, health officials said. An emergency directive from Gov. Steve Sisolak requires counties to adopt mask requirements for indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces in line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if they surpass thresholds for COVID-19 transmission. Rural Eureka County is the state’s only jurisdiction currently not subject to a mask requirement but reported high transmission for the second week in a row, triggering the mandate. The reintroduction of masks and the debut of vaccine requirements in venues like sporting events, conventions and some schools have been met with resistance throughout the state. In the Las Vegas area, the president of the school board said she has received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 shots. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had “very disturbing images” but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. “We have no time for hate,” she said. The board’s plan includes a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: St. Paul’s School now has an advocate who provides confidential support to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and a new software system to keep track of campus misconduct reports, according to a compliance monitor hired to oversee the handling of sexual abuse claims at the school. The report from Donald Sullivan was released Thursday through the New Hampshire attorney general’s office, which mandated the position as part of an agreement that subjected the Concord boarding school to as much as five years of government oversight in lieu of criminal charges. The 2018 agreement followed an investigation that found credible evidence of abuse involving 20 former faculty members over several decades. Sullivan started his job Jan. 18. His report was completed in July. Just like other schools, St. Paul’s was affected by COVID-19 protocols that resulted in a smaller campus population and additional quarantine time, Sullivan wrote. “There is no way to tell how much the diminished on-campus time or other COVID-19 protocols affected the number of reportable incidents, but it is reasonable to assume that there was some reduction,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLower Alloways Creek: State and federal officials broke ground Thursday on a facility designed to help the state take a leadership position in the burgeoning offshore wind energy industry on the East Coast. Gov. Phil Murphy and U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh were among those who spoke at the ceremony for the New Jersey Wind Port in Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County. The facility is designed to provide a place to manufacture giant blades and other components for offshore wind energy projects, which are increasingly being proposed – and approved – off the New Jersey coastline. Its cost is estimated at $300 million to $400 million. “What we are doing is not only going to create good jobs, but it is going to be our greatest stand against climate change,” said Murphy, a Democrat. Walsh, the former Boston mayor, noted that President Joe Biden in March set a goal of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy operating by 2030, enough to power about 10 million homes. Walsh said he hopes similar projects will be approved elsewhere along the nation’s shorelines. “Other states can follow suit, right here, with what is happening in New Jersey,” he said. Major construction is due to begin in December and should be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A police officer who adopted a child from a pregnant woman he found using heroin in what has been held up as an alternative to abortion is pictured in uniform on an anti-abortion billboard without his permission, his superiors say. Albuquerque Police Officer Ryan Holets appears on a billboard along an interstate that runs through the city, along with the words “My favorite right is life.” The images include two of him holding his daughters, including one daughter he adopted from a couple he found shooting heroin while on patrol in 2017. Holets also helped raise money to find housing for girl’s biological parents while they completed a drug rehabilitation program in 2018. The heroin-using woman was pregnant at the time Holets found her, and she agreed to give up the girl for adoption after the birth. Anti-abortion activists who have held up Holets’ adoption of the girl as an alternative to abortion include the grandmother of his other daughter, Ethel Maharg, who is the executive director of Right to Life New Mexico, the anti-abortion group that used his image on the billboard. The Albuquerque Police Department said Holets declined the group permission to use the image of him in uniform because it would violate policy. “That’s not true,” Maharg told local TV station KRQE in an edited interview.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A former nurse who co-founded and once ran the cultlike NXIVM group – in which prosecutors say some women were brainwashed, branded like animals and coerced into sex – was sentenced Wednesday to 42 months in prison but won’t be locked up until January. Nancy Salzman, the former president and co-founder of NXIVM, must also pay a $150,000 fine, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said. She has agreed to forfeit more than $500,000 in cash, several properties and a Steinway grand piano. Salzman must report to prison by Jan. 19, Garaufis said. Her lawyers said she has been caring for her ailing mother. Speaking in Brooklyn federal court, Salzman, 67, said that she fell under NXIVM leader Keith Raniere’s spell when they started working together 20 years ago and that she started rationalizing and overlooking the wrongdoing she saw around her. She offered an apology to everyone she’s hurt. “I don’t know that I can ever forgive myself,” she said. Salzman, known within the Albany-based group as “Prefect,” pleaded guilty in March 2019 to charges of racketeering conspiracy that involved conspiracy to commit identity theft and conspiracy to obstruct justice. She was one of the first in the group’s leadership to plead guilty to criminal charges.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Unvaccinated Buncombe County workers might lose paid COVID-19 quarantine leave under a proposal put forward by local government leaders, with one elected official calling those who have not gotten the shot “irresponsible” and questioning whether they should face deeper benefit cuts. “I think we’ve had a very generous policy around these kinds of issues throughout the pandemics, as well we should. But for staff who make the irresponsible decision to not get vaccinated, I question whether we can continue to provide these kind of policies,” Buncombe Board of Commissioners Chair Brownie Newman said. The board will hold a Sept. 21 public hearing on the potential change to emergency sick leave policy that would affect some members of the approximately 1,800-person county workforce, including sheriff’s staff. The county started the paid quarantine leave before “vaccines came into play,” Buncombe Human Resources Director Sharon Burke told commissioners at a Tuesday meeting. It was given to select employees who could not work from home, such as detention facility officers, patrol deputies, emergency medical technicians and staff administering vaccines.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKeene: State regulators are investigating a spill that released nearly 48,000 gallons of produced water and more than 1,000 gallons of oil. The state Oil and Gas Division said the incident happened Wednesday at a Slawson Exploration well about 14 miles northwest of Keene. The spill was due an equipment failure or malfunction, officials said. Authorities said Thursday that the water and oil was contained to the site and was recovered and hauled away. Produced water is a byproduct of oil extraction and is typically taken from the well to a disposal site. A state inspector has been to the location and will monitor any additional cleanup that’s required.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature violated the state constitution when they added and approved a last-minute provision that eliminated gun owners’ duty to retreat when facing threats, according to two Democratic lawmakers, the Ohio branch of the NAACP and a grassroots organizing group that filed a lawsuit Thursday. The lawsuit filed in state court in Columbus seeks to repeal the law signed by GOP Gov. Mike DeWine in January. The amendment was improperly added during the final hours of the Legislature’s two-year session in December to what had been a largely bipartisan bill giving nonprofits and other organizations civil immunity when someone with a concealed carry license causes injury or death on their property or at events, the lawsuit said. The “stand-your-ground” provision is unconstitutional, the lawsuit said, because lawmakers voted on it without three days of hearings and violated a law that says legislation should be limited to similar subjects. The NAACP said eliminating the duty to retreat makes it “easier to kill human beings without the perpetrators facing any legal consequences,” a problem that would especially imperil “human beings” who are Black Ohioans.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon will require proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the race in order to participate in the annual event this year. “This marathon stands for the same resilience of our community we saw (following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing) and we can see now,” Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum Director Kari Watkins said Wednesday. “We believe we can honor those who were killed, those who survived and those changed forever by running this race and honoring so many who have bravely battled this worldwide pandemic.” The race will also be capped at 12,000 runners, half the number for the last live race in 2019, and will start in waves to allow for social distancing. Like last year’s race, which was run virtually because of the pandemic, the 2021 race has been rescheduled for October from the traditional date in April to coincide with the anniversary of the bombing. Also Wednesday, Oklahoma County District Judge Natalie Mai formalized her temporary injunction blocking a state law that bans schools from implementing mask mandates. Mai’s order said exemptions must be granted for medical reasons or personal objections.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: An infant has died from COVID-19 complications, officials said. The News-Review in Roseburg reports the baby less than a year old was diagnosed with COVID-19-related symptoms Aug. 20 and died Monday, according to the Douglas County COVID-19 Recovery Team. The baby was one of 13 deaths listed in the county’s Wednesday report. Children under age 12 are not eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. All but one of the others who died and were mentioned in the Wednesday report were not fully vaccinated, officials said. “The significant number of deaths over the past month have been so incredibly tragic and heartbreaking,” Douglas County Public Health Officer Bob Dannenhoffer said. He said officials have chosen not to provide detailed case information out of respect for patient privacy and because of ethical responsibility to medical records laws. “We can say that some of those who died were perfectly well before they contracted COVID and died,” Dannenhoffer said. The health team thoroughly investigates all deaths and reviews all medical records to make sure everyone meets the requirements for a COVID-19-related death per the Oregon Investigative Guidelines, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An apparent loophole in the state’s mask mandate for schools is making it easier for some students to go to class without having to cover their faces, even as education regulators sought to make an example of one openly defiant school board. The state health secretary’s order requiring masks to be worn inside K-12 school and child care facilities, which took effect Tuesday, includes an exemption for students who claim it would cause or worsen a medical condition. But there’s no obligation in the masking order for a student to produce a doctor’s note or other supporting medical documentation. Now some school boards that oppose the statewide mandate or have gotten an earful from parents are allowing students to go unmasked with just a parent’s signature. Spot checks by the Associated Press of about 50 school districts Thursday revealed at least a dozen around the state – from huge suburban school systems outside Philadelphia to rural districts in the west – are using exemption forms that don’t require a medical professional’s signature, making it easy for parents to opt out on behalf of their children. And while most districts are complying with the letter of the mask mandate, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County is openly flouting it by keeping face coverings optional.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s smallest city has a new slogan. Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera announced Thursday that her city will now carry the tagline “Diversity that Inspires.” Rivera said the new slogan honors the city’s distinction as the most ethnically diverse in Rhode Island. It’s intended to replace Central Falls’ unofficial nickname as the “Comeback City,” which it earned after filing for bankruptcy in 2011. It emerged from bankruptcy the following year. The new slogan was selected by an all-volunteer branding committee. Located north of Providence, Central Falls is a city of 20,000 that occupies a little more than 1 square mile.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSummerton: Three new historical markers unveiled in the community commemorate its role in two legal battles that helped end racial segregation in U.S. schools. One of the markers stands outside the home where the Rev. J.A. De Laine asked Levi Pearson to file an NAACP-backed lawsuit demanding equal access to busing for Black schoolchildren. The 1948 case Levi Pearson v. County Board of Education was dismissed because of a technicality. But it set the stage for a second challenge from the Summerton community, WIS-TV reports. In 1950, the NAACP again sued over unequal busing by the Clarendon County school board. Though initially unsuccessful, the case Briggs vs. Elliott became one of five lawsuits appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court that formed the basis of its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. A marker was placed outside the St. Mark AME Church in Summerton where the NAACP held fundraisers and public meetings to recruit parents willing to demand equal school transportation. Another marks the home where Harry Briggs Sr. signed a petition against Clarendon County School Board President R.W. Elliott, who refused to supply Black schools with buses. The Summerton Community Action Group said it hopes the markers inspire others to keep pursuing equality.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Sanford Health said Wednesday that it is giving $350 million to a clinical initiative that aims to create a virtual care center to treat people in rural and underserved areas of the Midwest. The center will serve people from across Sanford Health’s network of hospitals, clinics and long-term care facilities. It will also house innovation, education and research initiatives to work on digital healthcare solutions for the future. Sanford bills itself as one of the largest rural health care systems in the country. It has 46 hospitals, 1,500 physicians and more than 200 Good Samaritan Society senior care locations in 26 states and 10 countries. It is based in Sioux Falls and also has major medical centers in Fargo and Bismarck, North Dakota, and Bemidji, Minnesota. The gift comes on the heels of a $300 million donation announced in March that included a significant expansion of graduate medical education and the addition of 18 new sports fields at the Sanford Sports Complex in Sioux Falls.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s forestry office is now taking orders for tree seedlings for planting throughout the state. The Department of Agriculture’s Division of Forestry said it is offering tree and shrub seedlings for reforestation and conservation projects through the East Tennessee Nursery in Delano. It is accepting orders until April 15, while supplies last. Officials said landowners may apply for free seedlings under three different programs. “Trees for Tennessee” seeks to increase pine regeneration on recently harvested land or fallow fields. “Play, Plant, Preserve” works to make sure wood used for making drumsticks and mallets in Tennessee is sustainable. For both programs, the landowner must have a reforestation prescription plan prepared by a professional forester, officials said. The Duck and Elk River Watershed Buffer Initiative seeks to enhance riparian zone or wetland buffers for wildlife with primarily nut-producing hardwoods. The land must be in one of the following counties: Bedford, Coffee, Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Hickman, Humphreys, Lewis, Lincoln, Marshall, Maury, Moore or Williamson.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas chapter of the NAACP and a group of students have filed a federal civil rights complaint against the University of Texas for its continued use of school song “The Eyes of Texas,” which has racist elements in its past. The complaint filed Sept. 3 with the U.S. Department of Education alleges that Black students, athletes, band members, faculty and alumni are being subjected to violations of the Civil Rights Act and a hostile campus environment over the “offensive,” “disrespectful” and “aggressive” use of the song. The NAACP and the students want the federal government to withhold funding from the university. Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP and a Texas law school graduate, sharply criticized the state Wednesday for requiring the Longhorn Band to play the song at athletic events and expecting athletes to stand and sing it after games. “It’s like slave owners making slaves buck dance for their entertainment,” Bledsoe said. The complaint, which includes statements from several anonymous students, alleges that those who oppose the song on campus are being harassed and that Black students feel “humiliated” whenever it is played or sung. “The Eyes of Texas” was written in 1903 and has a history of performances in minstrel shows with musicians often in blackface.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A nearly 5-month-old California condor has made its maiden flight, becoming Zion National Park’s second wild-hatched nestling to successfully fledge. The California condor is an ancient but critically endangered species, meaning this young bird is now a crucial part of Utah and Arizona’s 103-bird strong population, the park said in a press release. “We are elated to see the continued success of this condor pair in Zion National Park. It is certainly an occasion for celebration in the recovery effort, yet again demonstrating the resiliency of the California condor. What a spectacular site, to see wild-hatched condors soaring amongst the towering rock formations of Zion National Park.” Tim Hauck, condor program manager for the Peregrine Fund, said in the release. Condor #1111 made the flight early, as most condors take their first leap into the air at about 6 months old, though it will continue to be dependent on its parents for the next 12-24 months. Young #1111’s parents, both bred in captivity and released into Vermillion Cliffs National Monument in the late aughts, have been together for four years, and this is their fourth nestling. “Because the adults spend so much time caring for their young, wild condor pairs normally produce one egg every other year,” the release said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A new museum dedicated to the state’s musical heritage is opening in the city. The Tiny Museum of Vermont Music History opens Friday evening during the first day of the annual South End Art Hop. The museum on Howard Street will become a permanent addition to the headquarters of the nonprofit group Big Heavy World, which promotes and preserves Vermont-made music. The museum will feature photographs, posters, instruments and even menus from old venues. The collection “reflects how music is an art form, a catalyst for community-building, and also a contributor to the state’s economy,” James Lockridge, executive director of Big Heavy World, wrote in a news release. “People are – and have been – making music of all kinds across the state, deserving to be heard and celebrated.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Work crews searching for a time capsule they believed was buried inside the pedestal under a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that had towered over the city hit a snag Thursday. Crews were having difficulty finding the capsule’s precise location. Then late Thursday morning, a crane they were using to lift heavy pieces of a cornerstone broke down, stalling work until another crane was brought in a few hours later. State officials were scheduled to remove the 134-year-old time capsule from the cornerstone a day after the large Confederate statue was taken down. But after removing a 2,500-pound capstone and a 500-pound lid, crews were unable to pinpoint the capsule’s precise location. Workers had been using ground-penetrating radar devices to try to find the capsule in a third piece of the cornerstone. Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief of staff, Clark Mercer, said crews would keep looking for it in the cornerstone and adjoining stones. They also decided to dig into the lid of the cornerstone to insert a new time capsule, and state officials ceremonially placed it Thursday. The new capsule contains items reflective of current times, including an expired vial of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a Black Lives Matter sticker, and a photograph of a Black ballerina with her fist raised near the Lee statue amid racial justice protests last year.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: King County is working to set up a COVID-19 vaccine verification system that could go into effect next month at certain nonessential, high-risk settings. The Seattle Times reports this would make it easier for places like clubs, theaters and stadiums to check the vaccination status of their patrons. King County’s announcement came as nearly all major spectator sports in the Seattle area said they would require vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for admission to their games. The county said it is gathering feedback from community organizations, labor unions, businesses and cities. “COVID-19 vaccines are safe, highly effective and readily available, and verifying vaccination in certain nonessential, high-risk settings can make those places safer for the public, workers and our community, including children who are not currently eligible for vaccination,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, King County’s health officer. Vaccines are free, and health insurance is not required. Other jurisdictions including Hawaii, New York, San Francisco and British Columbia have begun to implement vaccine verification systems.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Some hospitals in rural parts of the state have reached their critical bed capacities as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to surge statewide, health officials said Wednesday. Health officials are pleading with the public to avoid unnecessary emergency room visits to allow hospitals to focus their resources on treating COVID-19 patients. There were 813 patients hospitalized for the virus statewide Wednesday, just below the record 818 on Jan. 5, when vaccination efforts were starting. There were a record 252 virus patients in hospital ICUs and a record 132 patients on ventilators, according to state data. “Our hospitals are being stressed in ways that they haven’t been stressed before,” Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus expert, said at a news conference. In southern West Virginia, Princeton Community Hospital had no ICU beds available due to an increase in COVID-19-related patients, hospital President and CEO Karen Bowling said Wednesday. In Lewisburg in the southeastern corner of the state, the 122-bed Greenbrier Valley Medical Center also was at capacity, according to a Facebook post from Dr. Bridgett Morrison, Greenbrier County’s health officer.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Sen. Steve Nass has officially asked the Legislature’s Republican leaders to sue the University of Wisconsin System after system officials refused to submit their COVID-19 protocols to his committee for approval. Nass sent a letter to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu demanding they file a lawsuit forcing system leaders to submit their policies to the Legislature’s rules committee. Nass, a Republican and longtime UW critic, co-chairs the committee. UW System President Tommy Thompson has called for UW campuses to hold at least 75% of classes in person this semester. The schools have implemented a range of protocols to meet that goal, including mask and coronavirus testing mandates. Nass had been threatening to sue for weeks unless system leaders hand over the policies to the rules committee for approval. Thompson has maintained the system has the legal authority to manage itself and doesn’t need legislators’ approval to adopt policies to protect students and faculty. He has said he would win any lawsuit. The squabble has caused a rift between Republicans who vehemently oppose any mandates to mitigate COVID-19 and those who still see Thompson, who served four terms as governor, as a GOP icon.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: For a second year in a row, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch will not visit the University of Wyoming due to the coronavirus pandemic. Gorsuch had been scheduled to visit the law school and campus Sept. 16, giving a talk alongside Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Lynne Boomgaarden in the Buchanan Center for the Performing Arts concert hall. The virus postponed a 2020 visit planned in recognition of the law school’s 100th anniversary. Rising rates of COVID-19 generally, not cases at the university specifically, were the reason for cancellation, university spokesman Chad Baldwin said Tuesday. There were no plans to reschedule, university officials said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/28/pancake-record-battered-sea-tortoise-tourist-coronado-motel-news-around-states/118974670/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal judge paved the way for Alabama to proceed with a lethal injection next month, but also reprimanded the state attorney general’s office for giving false information to the court during the litigation centered on forms given to death-row inmates for selecting an execution method. Chief U.S. District Judge Emily C. Marks dismissed a lawsuit that argued the state failed to give Willie Smith, who has an IQ below 75, required help under the Americans with Disabilities Act in filling out forms that affected the timing of his execution. Smith is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 21 by lethal injection for the 1991 kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham. After Alabama authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, the state gave death row inmates a brief window to select that as their execution method. The state has not yet developed a protocol for using nitrogen hypoxia and is not setting execution dates for inmates who requested it. Smith did not turn in a form selecting nitrogen. His attorneys argued that the state was required by law to help intellectually disabled inmates like Smith with the form. Marks dismissed the claim, saying the form was not required by state law and that Smith could have have written on his own to request nitrogen.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state plans to emphasize telework for state employees for the next month as the COVID-19 pandemic strains Alaska’s health care system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a memo to state department leaders last week, said the state “must take measures to protect its health care infrastructure while still providing essential government services to its residents.” He wrote that, effective Monday, the state will emphasize telework “to the maximum extent practical, while still maintaining public facing presence and services.” This is to be in effect until Oct. 29, he said. A determination on any possible extensions will be made later, he said. Brian Penner, director of the union that represents supervisory employees, told the Anchorage Daily News the decision was welcomed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Gov. Doug Ducey has ousted and replaced all five members of the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy in the wake of a newspaper’s critical report about the occupational regulatory panel’s handling of complaints about alleged sexual abuse by therapists. Ducey’s announcement Friday didn’t mention the Arizona Republic’s Sept. 15 investigative report that the board was lax in disciplining therapists accused of abuse, but he said it was crucial that the board “protects massage clients, especially those who are in a vulnerable position.” The announcement also said Ducey’s appointments implemented legislation enacted in 2020 to have the massage board and certain other regulatory panels have majorities of public members once current members’ terms expired. Public members are people not in the regulated occupations. Ducey noted that three of the five new members have experience in victim advocacy and support. The other two are licensed massage therapists with more than 25 years of experience.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:A new individualized-approached, tuition-free charter school will open for Fort Smith high school students next year. The Premier High School-Fort Smith will start enrolling in May and start its first school year in August, said Dennis Felton, state director of Premier schools. The school offers an educational environment that is individualized and small by design, according to the Premier website. “(It’s) for students when traditional school isn’t a fit for them,” said Jake Kurz, director of communications for Responsive Ed. “Sometimes that means a schedule and sometimes that means they need to recover credits (from where) they got behind. Sometimes that means they want to graduate early.” The school's curriculum is more student mastery-based, giving them a chance to work at their pace as opposed to a teacher’s pace, Felton said. The school offers different sessions for students so they can deal with a job or attend to other obligations if needed, Kurz said. The first Premier high school in Arkansas opened in Little Rock in 2013. The Fort Smith school will mark the fourth location in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: U.S. Rep Karen Bass, D-Calif., intends to launch a campaign for Los Angeles mayor, joining a field of candidates that has rapidly grown over the last week, according to three people familiar with her plans. Such a move would deliver another shakeup to a contest that had been a sleepy affair for much of the year. Bass, a high-profile Democrat who has served in Sacramento and Washington, could announce her entry into the mayor’s race as early as this week, those sources told the Los Angeles Times. If Bass enters the race, she would be a formidable competitor, said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who described himself as an ally of Bass since 1978.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:The Coronado Motel, once one of the few spots in the city Black travelers could rely on for safe accommodation – it was one of a handful of places listed in “The Negro Traveler’s Green Book,” a guidebook that identified facilities hospitable to Black guests during the Jim Crow era – received the Stephen H. Hart Award from History Colorado’s State Historical Fund for its commercial, architectural and ethnic significance. It is one of five sites in Colorado to receive the award this year. The motel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places last year. The owners of the then-Coronado Lodge began officially listing the motel in the Green Book in 1957. The Green Book listed hotels, service stations, restaurants, drug stores and other locations that were safe ports of call for Black travelers, who faced discrimination and the threat of harm while traveling throughout the segregated country. Victor Hugo Green published the book annually until just after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 70 members of the Connecticut National Guard were honored Saturday for their service after completing nearly one-year tours of duty. A welcome home ceremony was held for members of the Middletown-based 143rd Regional Support Group and several members of Detachment 2, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 641st Aviation Regiment at the state armory in Hartford. The Middletown-based soldiers supported Operation Spartan Shield in Jordan from October 2020 to July 2021, overseeing base operations and contracts at various facilities. The Windsor Locks-based aviation regiment conducted 166 C-12 air movement missions throughout eastern Africa in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa from September 2020 to July 2021. “These soldiers left their homes and families during a very difficult time in this country to answer the nation’s call and support U.S. security interests abroad,” Maj. Gen. Francis Evon said in a written statement. “We thank them for their sacrifice and their families who took care of the home front for almost a year. It’s always a great feeling when we get to welcome our people back home after completion of a successful mission.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings has filed a lawsuit against chemical company Monsanto and spinoffs Solutia and Pharmacia, alleging long-lasting damage to the state’s natural resources. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court last Wednesday alleged Monsanto knew as early as 1937 that polychlorinated biphenyls had systemic toxic effects on humans and animals and it seeks to recover damages and clean-up costs, Jennings said in a news release. “Monsanto knew that PCBs were toxic and that once they entered the environment, they would be there to stay,” Jennings said. “Even as PCBs’ environmental harms became undeniable, Monsanto not only continued to manufacture and sell PCBs, but increased production. Now, decades since PCBs were banned, Delaware taxpayers are still footing the cleanup bill. We’re suing Monsanto and its spinoffs to make them pay to clean up their mess.” The suit also claims Monsanto understood and “actively promoted the fact that PCBs do not naturally break down; and continued to manufacture, market and sell PCBs despite full awareness of these dangers.” Bayer, which purchased Monsanto in 2016, responded to the lawsuit saying the company voluntarily ceased all PCB production in 1977, two years before production was banned, The News-Journal reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Students at George Washington University continue to voice concerns about possible mold exposure on campus. In early September, the university ordered 175 students to temporarily evacuate their housing in Townhouse Row, along 23rd Street NW, because of environmental concerns. According to Maralee Csellar, director of communications at George Washington University, a team that inspected the housing identified conditions “conducive to biological growth”. The university did not say it had discovered mold. Around the same time of that investigation, another GW student also claimed he and his roommates had found a mold-like substance in Shenkman Hall, which is a residential tower located across the street from Townhouse Row. Shenkman resident and GW sophomore Luc Saint-Genies said his roommates were coughing for over a week after they found the material in parts of their living unit. Saint-Genies said he and his roommates were recently moved by the university to emergency housing at the River Inn hotel in Foggy Bottom after GW’s facilities division conducted an inspection of their residence. GW moved Townhouse Row students to two hotels, including the River Inn, after its inspection of that site as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral:Space Florida, the state’s spaceport authority and aerospace development agency, is investigating what it will take to bring more Space Force operations to Brevard County, an area already home to two military installations, NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, and dozens of commercial spaceflight companies. The branch established in late 2019 still needs to make decisions on where to establish some operations like training centers. Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station were among the first former Air Force facilities to be renamed as Space Force installations. Much like the Marine Corps falls under the purview of the Navy, the Space Force is positioned under Air Force leadership. Mark Bontrager, Space Florida’s vice president for spaceport operations, said, Florida could be an ideal location for training facilities, or what are known as technical schools. Tech schools usually come immediately after basic training and prepare new military members – in this case, Space Force guardians – for their specific roles. Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles, California, was already selected for the first of five STARCOM sub-commands, or “deltas,” but more selections are expected in the coming months. Its command headquarters, however, is still up for grabs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: Leaders on one of Georgia’s most popular coastal islands are considering letting developers build closer to sand dunes. The Brunswick News reported that a planning commission that governs construction on St. Simons Island is discussing reducing the required setback for new construction in areas with active dunes from 40 feet to 25 feet. The new rule would increase the required setback from 20 feet to 25 feet for an area without dunes. Commissioners agreed Tuesday to postpone action until November to allow time for a public workshop. The idea originated from a planning commission meeting with Glynn County commissioners to discuss growth on the island. Glynn County Commissioner Cap Fendig said the proposed changes would match Georgia Department of Natural Resources rules. Current Glynn County rules are more restrictive. Dunes can protect beaches and inland areas and also provide habitat for plants and wildlife. Alice Keyes of the environmental group One Hundred Miles said rising sea levels make setbacks even more important.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The island of Kauai is planning to revise its coronavirus restriction structure as the delta variant continues to impact the county. Mayor Derek Kawakami said officials will continue to enforce strict COVID-19 safety measures even as the state approaches a vaccination rate of 70%, a milestone earlier set for loosening rules under a tiered reopening plan, The Garden Island reported Friday. “Throughout this pandemic, we have adjusted to the changing realities of COVID-19, and we continually work to keep our community safe while doing everything we can to keep our businesses and activities open,” Kawakami said. Changes will need to be approved by Gov. David Ige. The current tier system would have allowed for all restrictions, including business capacity rules and gathering sizes, to be dropped when the population was 70% vaccinated. About 67% of state residents and 65% of Kauai residents are fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene:, The Coeur d’Alene School District’s Board of Trustees canceled a special meeting on Friday to consider a temporary COVID-19 mask mandate after protesters swarmed the building. The crowd gathered outside of the Midtown Center Meeting Room at 1 p.m., KREM-TV reported. The meeting agenda included a reopening plan for the 2021-2022 school year, including masking and quarantine. Earlier this month, the board adopted a plan that strongly recommended masks be worn in schools. The school district has seen hundreds of positive COVID-19 cases since the first day of school Sept. 7. The meeting was postponed officials said for safety reasons after the crowd banged on doors and shouted at police. A video tweeted by a reporter for KREM showed a large group of people standing outside of the meeting room chanting, “No more masks.” Estimated at up to 200 people, the group then moved to the district’s administrative center, which was placed on lockdown for safety precautions. Many protesters said school board members should be fired for refusing to hold the meeting.\n\nIllinois\n\nEast Moline: Inmates at East Moline Correctional Center have begun a Bachelor of Arts program through Augustana College. State officials said 10 students began studies late in the summer. They are taking courses from professors who lecture on the same subjects on Augustana’s Rock Island campus. It’s the first BA program offered East Moline inmates in more than 20 years. The initial program offers a communications studies major with other majors to be added. The liberal arts curriculum includes history, literature, math, foreign languages, religion, science and the arts. Illinois Department of Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys said a college degree is key to those in custody who want to change their lives and provide financially for their families. Augustana modeled its program after the Bard Prison Initiative. It was featured in the 2019 PBS documentary “College Behind Bars.” Students in the Augustana Prison Education Program pay no tuition or any costs associated with coursework. The program is funded by the Austin E. Knowlton Foundation.\n\nIndiana\n\nGreenwood: Another Indiana school board meeting was disrupted when residents refused to wear face masks while objecting to the district’s requirement. Sheriff’s deputies were called to the Center Grove school board meeting last Thursday night after those not wearing masks wouldn’t leave so the meeting could start, the (Franklin) Daily Journal reported. Those protesting left after two deputies arrived. A similar disruption happened in the southern Indianapolis suburbs as the Clark-Pleasant board meeting in Whiteland was adjourned after just two minutes last week because some people refused to wear masks. State officials have allowed mask rules and other steps to stem COVID-19 spread even as several school boards have faced vocal – and sometimes misleading – opposition to such actions. A man was arrested in July when a handgun fell from his pocket during a Carmel school board meeting, The Bartholomew Consolidated school board in Columbus decided this past week it will hold meetings virtually because of parent conduct. Center Grove’s board could make a similar move, district Superintendent Rich Arkanoff said.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville:Residents gathered to help break a syrupy Guinness World Record on Saturday by plating 14,280 pancakes in a single-serving. A Hy-Vee store in Blue Springs, Missouri, a Kansas City suburb, set the record of 13,000 pancakes in June. Hy-Vee donated 2,400 pounds of pancake mix to help residents break the record during Centerville’s Pancake Day celebration. The Guinness World Record attempt took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. Pancake Day started in 1948 as a way for manufacturers, including a Pillsbury facility, across Centerville show appreciation for their employees by giving them free pancakes. Community members took on the event and turned it into a regional celebration as manufacturers left Centerville. The town typically serves about 17,000 pancakes on Pancake Day, said Centerville Tourism Director Delaney Evers. This year, pancakes had to be made to strict specifications of at least 5 inches in diameter, but no more than 1 centimeter in thickness. About 100 people volunteered to accomplish the feat.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: A suburban Kansas City school district is investigating after a student asked a girl to homecoming using an offensive sign. The sign reads: “If I was Black I would be picking cotton but I’m white so I’m picking you for HOCO.” A picture of two white students holding the sign and smiling that was posted online drew sharp criticism on social media, according to the Kansas City Star. School officials in Olathe said they are working to contact everyone involved, including the parents of the students. “The type of behavior displayed in the social media post does not meet the expectations of our core values,” Olathe South High School Principal Dale Longenecker said in a letter sent to parents. “Any behavior like this will be immediately addressed in accordance with our Student Code of Conduct.” A copy of the photo posted on Twitter was criticized by the Arizona Cardinals Isaiah Simmons’, who grew up in Olathe. “This is disgusting. Sad that people think this is funny or acceptable,” he wrote. “Very disappointing and honestly just sad to see this kind of stuff happening in my hometown. I hope this is handled in the correct manner.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Horse Soldier Bourbon plans to create more than 50 jobs with a new $200 million tourism project in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The Pulaski County site will contain a 27,585-square-foot distillery visitor center; 5,000-person amphitheater; 500-person outdoor event space; 3,200-square-foot wedding chapel; and an activity center, shops and more. Horse Soldier Bourbon was founded by retired members of the U.S. Special Forces who were among the first to enter Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The company has been approved by the Kentucky Tourism Development Finance Authority for $29.9 million in incentives for the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGrand Isle: Grand Isle officials said the narrow barrier island is closed to all but people who live there or those who own camps there as residents try to recover from Hurricane Ida’s devastating impacts. In a posting on the town’s website Saturday, officials said the widespread devastation caused the town council and the mayor to make the decision to close the island, which is a destination spot for fishing and vacation getaways. “The decision to close the island was a difficult one,” said Mayor David Camardelle in the announcement, “but it is in everyone’s best interest.” Ida came ashore on Aug. 29 just a few miles away near Port Fourchon. The Category 4 hurricane’s ferocious winds and storm surge destroyed the city’s electrical infrastructure. The town said in its announcement that 80% of the structures on the island sustained damage. According to the post, about 200 personnel from various agencies are on the island specifically to help with the recovery. That number is expected to increase as energy provider, Entergy, works to restore the grid, the statement said. But Grand Isle residents have vowed to come back, despite the damage.\n\nMaine\n\nHampden: The northbound stretch of a $45 million bridge replacement project in the Bangor area is almost finished. The project is called the Hampden Bridge Bundle. The Maine Department of Transportation said it planned to shift traffic onto the fourth of four new northbound Interstate 95 bridges on Monday. The transportation department said traffic is still using three temporary bridges to accommodate construction work on the southbound side of the highway. The department said more southbound traffic shifts are expected, and the project will continue into next year. The entire project requires rebuilding eight bridges and rehabilitating a ninth along a 4-mile stretch of the interstate in Hampden.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four enormous container cranes have arrived in their new home in Baltimore after a two-month trip from China. The cranes, which are some of the tallest in the world, squeezed under the Chesapeake Bay and Key Bridges on their way to the Port of Baltimore, stopping traffic on the spans on Sept. 9, news outlets reported. Each crane is about 450 feet tall, about 25 feet taller than the current cranes, port officials said. With the cranes hanging off each side of the ship, they were about 176 feet tall, leaving just about 10 feet of clearance under the bridges, according to the state and Coast Guard. The new cranes will help double the port’s container capacity once the Howard Street Tunnel is expanded to allow freight trains to carry containers stacked two-high. Ports America Chesapeake, which runs the Seagirt Marine Terminal under a lease with the state, purchased the massive cranes, which will allow longshoremen to unload two even larger and wider container ships at once. The 1,740-ton cranes can reach 23 containers across a container ship and each can lift 187,500 pounds of cargo at once.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLowell: A University of Massachusetts Lowell researcher has received a $2.7 million federal grant to continue her research into the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The National Institutes of Health grant will help engineering associate professor Joyita Dutta look at the disease from a network perspective, viewing the interconnections between the regions of the brain, the university said in a statement last week. She will use machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to build models from existing patient imaging data. She aims to develop models that predict the progression of primary protein markers for Alzheimer’s disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 5.8 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s last year. That number is projected to rise to 14 million by 2060. There is no known cure for the disease.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast China Township:Three years after DTE Energy paid more than $5,000 to relocate rare milkweed plants at its future Blue Water Energy Center site in East China Township, the plants are thriving. Daniel Okon, a DTE Energy senior environmental specialist, said 400 Sullivant’s milkweed stems were relocated in 2018 and the population has grown to 502 stems. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch butterfly, a candidate under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Milkweed and flowering plants are needed for monarch habitat. Adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many flowers, but they breed only where milkweeds are found, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Sullivant’s milkweed differs from common milkweed, with smooth leaves instead of the common variety’s rough leaves, and a pink vein pressed closely to the stems. Sullivant’s milkweed is classified as threatened and legally protected in Michigan. It has been observed in eight Michigan counties with the most occurrences found in St. Clair County, according to scientific biodiversity resource the Michigan Natural Features Inventory.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz proposed a $10 million relief package for farmers who suffered losses because of drought across most of Minnesota this summer – a plan that would require a special legislative session to approve. The Democratic governor’s proposal includes $5 million in rapid response grants for livestock producers and specialty crop growers for costs of water-related equipment such as tanks, pipelines, wells, water wagons and irrigation equipment. It also includes $5 million for zero-interest disaster recovery loans for losses not covered by insurance. But Walz said he’s still insisting that Senate Republicans agree not to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm if he calls lawmakers back for a special session that was already in the works for a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Negotiators from the House Democratic and Senate GOP majorities and the Walz administration missed a Labor Day target for agreeing to which workers are most deserving and how much money they should get. Republicans so far have not backed off a threat to use the Senate’s confirmation powers to oust Malcolm over the administration’s pandemic response. Walz called on them to “put the political posturing and things aside” and get both packages done without ousting his health commissioner.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A hospital in the Mississippi Delta has been losing millions of dollars a year, and its CEO said the problems are exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic as nurses, laboratory technicians and respiratory therapists are being hired by out-of-state hospitals for short-term contract work at higher salaries. Leaders of Greenwood Leflore Hospital held closed-door hearings in the past week to brief local officials and its employees about proposals for a financial turnaround. CEO Jason Studley said no layoffs or terminations are anticipated, although some positions might not be filled as employees leave, the Greenwood Commonwealth reported. Studley told the newspaper he would publicly release details of the financial plan in the coming week. The hospital has about 1,000 employees and is owned by the city of Greenwood and Leflore County. Local government officials asked for Tuesday’s meeting. “I think we’re on the right track to move forward,” said Leflore County Supervisor Sam Abraham after emerging from the closed-door session with the hospital board and top administrators. The hospital has spent nearly all of the $25 million in federal pandemic relief money. For the first 11 months of the current budget year, it has lost $13.2 million, even after using $11 million in federal grant money. For the same period last year, the loss was $755,000 when $15.5 million in coronavirus grant money was used. The hospital started the current budget year with $52.8 million cash on hand. By the end of August, it had $28.3 million.\n\nMissouri\n\nWoodson Terrace: The FBI has opened an investigation into the arrest of a Black man during which cellphone video showed three white officers allowing a police dog to repeatedly bite him. Woodson Terrace police Chief Randy Halstead said in an email to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his department was “fully cooperating” with the investigations being conducted by the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office into last week’s arrest. Federal officials and St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell declined to discuss their investigations with the newspaper. Officers were called Monday morning to a report that a man had broken into a business in Woodson Terrace, according to a police statement posted on Facebook. The man appeared to be on drugs and threatened officers, and they warned him the dog would be used if he continued to resist arrest, the department wrote. Cellphone video from an onlooker showed the dog biting the man’s foot as he yells. The dog’s handler holds it by a leash but allows the biting to go on for about 30 seconds. After the officer pulls off the dog, the man appears to take a step but stumbles and the dog lunges at him again, biting a leg for another 30 seconds until the officer stops the animal. The man was treated at a hospital and released. He hasn’t been charged with any crimes. Protesters gathered outside the Woodson Terrace Police Department on Friday to demand the firing and prosecution of the three officers.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A coalition including worker unions and a disability rights group filed a lawsuit last Wednesday against Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over a law passed earlier this year that eliminates same-day voter registration. The lawsuit was filed by the Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana AFL-CIO, the Montana Association of Centers for Independent Living, and several citizens. Montana Federal of Public Employees president Amanda Curtis called the law “a slap in the face” to the tens of thousands of Montana residents who use same-day voter registration and to the majority of Montanans who voted to maintain election-day registration when the question was on the ballot in 2014. “People who work for a living do not always have the privilege to register to vote or address their issues with their registration during the regular business hours,” said Montana AFL-CIO Executive Secretary James Holbrook. County election offices are open later on Election Day. Montana Independent Living Project advocacy coordinator Joel Peden said same-day registration eases the experience of people living with disabilities by saving the need for two trips to election offices. Republicans who supported the measure have said the law would help election officials conduct elections more efficiently while reducing long lines and voter frustration on election day. Secretary of State spokesman Richie Melby called the lawsuit “completely baseless.” This is the fourth lawsuit challenging the same law passed earlier this year by the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\nNebraska\n\nDakota City: The owners of a defunct biogas plant in northeast Nebraska have agreed to pay a $1.1 million fine to the state and federal governments for repeated violations of environmental rules. Big Ox Energy and its owners agreed to pay the fine as part of a settlement with regulators. The company and its insurers previously agreed to be part of a separate $1.75 million settlement with homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. “The Big Ox facility’s operations presented a significant risk to their workers and nearby property owners,” said acting regional EPA Administrator Edward H. Chu. The EPA said that some of the liquid wastewater went over the sides of the facility’s roof and onto the ground at least 16 times between 2017 and 2019. On one occasion in 2018, a malfunction at the plant resulted in 80,000 gallons of liquid wastewater overflowing from its equipment. At times the plant was also discharging methane at levels that could be flammable and hydrogen sulfide in amounts that could cause injury or death if it was inhaled.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Great Basin Institute has been awarded a $160,000 federal grant to establish a professional recreational trail building school, which would be the first of its kind in the nation. The funds came from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The proposed school will be in Ely. The hope is to draw outdoor recreation professionals from all over the U.S. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto praised the idea of the school. She said it will enhance Nevada’s reputation as an outdoor recreation destination, create more jobs and give students practical experience. Kyle Horvath, director of White Pine County Tourism and Recreation, said Ely is an ideal spot with its proximity to the Mountain West.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is making some of its pandemic-related graduation ceremony changes permanent. The school traditionally has held one large ceremony in its outdoor football stadium, but because of the pandemic, it divided seniors up by their colleges and held a handful of separate ceremonies. That gave students the chance to walk across the stage and receive their diplomas instead of being recognized all at once, and officials have decided to keep that practice going forward. Starting in May, commencement exercises will be moved indoors to the Whittemore Center and graduates will be split up by academic college, the Foster’s Daily Democrat reported.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Construction of a nearly 120-mile-long proposed natural gas pipeline from northeastern Pennsylvania to central New Jersey will not go forward, the group behind the project said Monday. PennEast Pipeline Company, which won a recent legal fight against New Jersey at the Supreme Court, nonetheless said the state has failed to provide certain permits and is putting the project on ice. “PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the Project no longer is supported. Accordingly, PennEast has ceased all further development of the Project,” spokesperson Pat Kornick said in an email. The decision is the latest swing in a long-running effort to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. It’s also a major victory for environmental groups who opposed the project, arguing it would cut a scar across the landscape, threaten wildlife and contribute the use of fossil fuels. PennEast, a company made up of five energy firms, won federal and Pennsylvania permitting approvals including a key Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate that could allow the firm to use eminent domain to acquire land. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court said companies building interstate pipelines can obtain the land they need even in the face of state opposition, once their projects have been given the green light by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Trump and Biden administrations had supported PennEast. Nineteen states had urged the Supreme Court to rule the other way and side with New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Rio Rancho Public Schools canceled classes Monday because of an internet service outage. Officials sent a letter to parents Sunday saying a damaged fiber optic circuit was causing the outage. With no internet, some key systems that involve safety and student transportation would be at risk. District officials said contractors are coming from out of state to do the repairs. Classes were expected to resume Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has stopped paying legal bills for employees who worked for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as he faces ongoing investigations on the state and federal levels. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s spokesperson Haley Viccaro said last Wednesday that the state stopped paying for those aides’ legal bills after Sept. 2. The administration is now deciding whether there is a legal basis for the state to pay bills for legal services on or before Sept. 2. Viccaro did not specify how many staffers had legal bills paid for by the state. Cuomo and his former aides face an ongoing investigation by the state attorney general into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote about his leadership during the pandemic and scrutiny from federal prosecutors who are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. Cuomo is also facing a state ethics commission inquiry. The state has agreed to pay a maximum of $9.5 million in bills for attorneys representing Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, as well as for attorneys investigating the former governor and his administration, according to the Associated Press’ review of available contracts. That figure includes up to $5 million for attorneys who have represented Cuomo’s office. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, Rita Glavin, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A construction company founded by former NFL players and brothers Torry and Terrence Holt will build a project designed to honor the contributions of African Americans in North Carolina. Leaders of the North Carolina Freedom Park initiative announced Monday that the Black-owned Holt Brothers Construction has been awarded the contract to complete the $5.4 million project in Raleigh. The park, to be located between the Executive Mansion and the Legislative Building. will be anchored by the Beacon of Freedom, a piece of public art that will be illuminated at night. Freedom Park’s leaders broke ground last fall on the park, which is expected to be completed by next year. The Holts grew up in Gibsonville and played at North Carolina State University. Torry Holt was an All-America wide receiver and played on the Super Bowl-winning St. Louis Rams in 2000. The brothers’ construction company has completed other projects such as a Durham County library renovation and North Carolina Central University’s new student center. Freedom Park was designed by the late architect Phil Freelon, who also designed the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, and the Durham firm Perkins & Will.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota’s only congressman, is in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus. Armstrong said in a Twitter post Sunday that he had been experiencing mild coronavirus symptoms and took a test which came back positive. The 44-year-old Republican said he has been vaccinated. “I have been fully vaccinated since January, and I am taking all precautions and recovering at home in North Dakota. I have been advised by my doctor to quarantine for ten days,” Armstrong wrote. Armstrong said he has contacted friends in Congress and will be casting his votes this week by proxy, as Capitol Hill gears up for a busy week that includes a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package. “Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to be in D.C. next week,” Armstrong wrote. “However, the votes we are taking are simply too important to miss, so I have reached out to friends in Congress and I will be casting my votes by proxy.”\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:Summa Health is reducing inpatient hospital beds by more than 20% and temporarily stopping some elective surgeries while the Akron-based health system tries to adjust to a nationwide staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a memo distributed to staff at 9 a.m. Monday, hospital executives said Summa would make multiple adjustments to help the care of patients as health care staff at Summa and nationwide are in some cases burned out and leaving the health care field. “We are no longer able to maintain the current level of capacity in our hospitals and we must make adjustments to align with the current level of clinical staff,” Summa executives said. The following measures will go into effect immediately: adjusting the combined inpatient bed capacity at Akron City and Barberton hospitals from 551 to about 430 by Oct. 24; the number of available inpatient beds will be cut from 439 to about 350 at Akron City Hospital and 112 to 80 at Barberton Hospital; improve Emergency Department flow by embeding specialists, primary care physicians and/or hospitalists in the emergency department on the Akron and Barberton campuses to initiate care more efficiently. There will be no changes at St. Thomas Hospital, which treats Summa’s behavioral health patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:A northwest Oklahoma City church hopes to become a transitional living community to temporarily house individuals experiencing homelessness and provide support to help them find permanent housing and a brighter future. Clark Memorial United Methodist Church wants to build up to 20 small structures similar to tiny homes or tiny housing units on its property. The Rev. Bo Ireland, the church’s senior pastor, is also executive director of what is being called the Lazarus Community at Clark Memorial. The name of the new housing community comes from well-known scripture which told the story of Jesus raising a man named Lazarus from the dead. “It’s a ministry that will be bringing back those who are homeless to a restored state,” Ireland said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Despite a threat to block new political maps, Republican state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday – the final day for the Legislature to complete redistricting. Enough GOP lawmakers returned to the House floor to achieve a quorum required to vote. With the Republican reverse, it is likely Democrats will pass new district maps – including a sixth, U.S. House seat. Congressional plans were sent to the redistricting committee on Monday morning to be formally adopted and the House was scheduled to reconvene at 1 p.m. Although Oregon Democrats hold the majority in both legislative chambers, they don’t have enough seats to vote without a few Republicans present. As the House convened Monday morning,47 of 60 House members were present – 40 lawmakers are needed to meet quorum. The Oregon Legislature had until the end of the day on Monday to participate in the once-a-decade job of redrawing the state’s congressional and legislative districts in accordance with new U.S. Census numbers. If lawmakers missed the deadline, the job of redrawing congressional maps would fall to a panel of five current and former judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court, and Democratic Secretary of State Shemia Fagan will be tasked with redrawing the state’s legislative districts. On Saturday, Republicans in the House did not show up for a floor session, upset that Democratic House Speaker Tina Kotek earlier this week rescinded a deal she made with them to split power in the redistricting debate, even though Democrats have large majorities in the Senate and House.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Transgender women in Pennsylvania tried again Monday to knock down state rules that govern legal name changes for people with felony records. The state requires them to wait two years after completing their sentence to apply for a name change. People who have committed the most serious felonies, including rape and murder, are barred from changing their legal names. The 1998 rules are meant to enhance public safety and thwart fraud attempts. However, advocates said the transgender community simply wants the right to use names that match their identities rather than their dead or given names. Gabriel Arkles, senior counsel of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, said his clients risk being harassed if they apply for jobs, or are stopped by police, and show identification that doesn’t match their gender identities. “For the people it affects, it has such a profound affect,” Arkles said. “Our clients are transgender people who are just trying to live their lives and are not trying to commit any fraud.” Similar efforts have been underway in other states, with varying degrees of success, he said. Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court, which handles cases involving state agencies, dismissed a related lawsuit last year on procedural grounds without addressing the underlying constitutional claims.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An open government coalition is asking Democratic Gov. Dan McKee to allow public agencies to hold meetings online because of a surge of COVID-19 infections. ACCESS/RI said it sent a letter to McKee asking him to issue an executive order because his previous order to waive the requirement that members of public bodies meet in person expired in July. Since then, the coalition said, some public bodies have had difficulty getting enough members to attend in person for a quorum and some members of the public have been reluctant to attend. “Members of the public face a choice between their health and their ability to participate in our democracy,” the coalition said. State legislatures in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts codified similar executive orders to allow for online meetings until the spring, the coalition added. Rhode Island’s legislature considered allowing online meetings until July 2023, which ACCESS/RI opposed because of the length of time and the belief that in-person meetings should be the default.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: Crews are getting ready to start restoring windows in a century-old building in Beaufort that were damaged by hurricanes over the past several years. The work on the 29 windows of the Carnegie Library building is being paid for through a $188,000 federal grant, The Island Packet of Hilton Head reported. Work is expected to start in October and last six months. The windows were damaged when Hurricane Matthew passed just offshore in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Beaufort officials also hired a building preservation expert to look at the entire former library and provide an estimate for any other worked needed to preserve it. The library in downtown Beaufort is one of 14 in South Carolina and more than 1,600 public libraries across the United States funded by steel industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The old library now houses the Beaufort/Port Royal Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been awarded an $11 million federal grant to develop better material and manufacturing technology to withstand cold weather. South Dakota Mines will partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Cold Regions and Engineering Lab. The research will be done over five years and is aimed at developing better materials and technology to support the Army’s military objectives in cold and remote regions. U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said funding for the project has been his top defense appropriation request for three years, the Rapid City Journal reported. Dr. Jim Rankin, president of South Dakota Mines, said the research is a win-win for the university and for national defense.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:A state senator charged with stealing $600,000 in federal grant money from a health care school she operated has been acquitted on 15 of 20 charges, according to court records. U.S. District Court Judge Sheryl Lipman filed the order Sunday after attorneys for Sen. Katrina Robinson filed a motion Friday seeking acquittal on all charges, Memphis news outlets reported. Robinson, 40, a Memphis Democrat elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2018, was charged in July 2020 with wire fraud, as well as theft and embezzlement involving government programs after the FBI searched the school and her home. She was accused of stealing federal grant money awarded to The Healthcare Institute, which provides training in the health care field, including nursing assistant jobs in geriatric care. The school received more than $2.2 million in federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The federal grant money was earmarked for student scholarships from 2015 through 2019. Robinson’s attorneys argued for an acquittal Friday after federal prosecutors rested their case. They argued that prosecutors didn’t prove allegations that Robinson used the federal grant funds on personal expenses. The trial was expected to continue Tuesday on the five remaining charges, court filings showed..\n\nTexas\n\nSouth Padre Island: A large loggerhead sea turtle rehabilitated at the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital was flown by private plane Sunday to live at a conservation facility in Texas. The 230-pound female turtle took the nearly 5-hour flight from the Middle Keys to South Padre Island, with the help of “Turtles Fly Too,” a nonprofit group that works with general aviation pilots who donate their aircraft, fuel and time to provide emergency transport for endangered species. Matthew, named for one of her rescuers before her sex was determined, suffered injuries to her shell in May 2020 from a boat strike that left her unable to dive and forage for food – a condition termed “bubble butt syndrome” by the hospital’s rehabilitation staff. “She’s being transported to Sea Turtle Inc. in South Padre Island because she’s unable to dive,” said Bette Zirkelbach, the Turtle Hospital’s general manager, who accompanied the reptile during the flight. “That makes her nonreleasable and she will act as an ambassador for her species there at the Texas facility where they see lots of visitors.” The reptile joins other rehabilitated, nonreleasable turtle patients at Sea Turtle Inc., located on the Gulf of Mexico. The organization’s conservation outreach programs are designed to raise public awareness about sea turtles and the threats to their survival. Matthew’s carapace has been fitted with weights, fashioned to adhere to the shell and help the turtle submerge and rest comfortably during her residency at the Texas center.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The St. George Marathon returns Saturday for its 45th edition and the first since 2019 after the 2020 race was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is set to start at its usual spot north of the city along State Route 18 at the base of the Pine Valley Mountains and descending nearly 2,600 feet in elevation back to the finish line downtown. The race starts at 7 a.m. and will force some road closures and detours along SR-18 and a number of streets in and around downtown. “We are so excited to have the marathon back in 2021. It is St. George’s signature event,” said Michelle Graves, race director and the Deputy Director of Arts and Events for the city of St. George. “This might be the best St. George Marathon ever. There has been a vibrant return to racing and we are happy to have a strong field of runners for this year's event.” This year's event will include a mini-marathon starting at 6:15 a.m, with races of 1 mile and 200 meters at Vernon Worthen Park. Children ages 3 to 12 and people with special needs are invited to participate. After the races, a party in the park is set to last until 8 a.m. Organizers expect about 7,000 runners to participate. Many others have signed on to be volunteers. The annual Mayor's Walk is also scheduled for Saturday morning, with Mayor Michele Randall leading a 1-mile walk from the Washington County School District offices at 121 W. Tabernacle Street over to Vernon Worthen. The marathon has been run every year except last year since 1977 and is regularly rated as one of the most scenic races in the country, as well as one of the fastest because of its downhill course.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Registration opened Monday for Vermonters ages 75 and older to get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster. On Wednesday, people 70 and older can start signing up followed by the 65-and-older age group on Friday. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed booster shots for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans six months after receiving their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. On Friday, those ages 18 to 64 with underlying medical conditions or who work in certain occupational settings will become eligible for boosters, the state said. The state is waiting for guidance from the CDC on the type of underlying medical conditions and occupational settings. Booster shots are available where Pfizer vaccines are offered, including at a Health Department clinic, pharmacy or health care provider, state officials said. People must make an appointment to get a shot at a state clinic and are asked to bring their vaccine cards with them. Information can be found on the Vermont Health Department website.\n\nVirginia\n\nLafayette: A small earthquake shook southwestern Virginia on Monday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 2.6 happened about 9:37 a.m. It was centered about 2.5 miles north of Lafayette, and was about 8 miles deep. News outlets reported that people in nearby Salem reported feeling the ground shaking, but there were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Twenty-five media and transparency groups are asking the state Supreme Court to allow the release of the names of the Seattle police officers who attended events in the nation’s caital on Jan. 6. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press and the news organizations filed an amicus brief Friday asking the court to deny an injunction filed by the officers that seeks to block the release of public records that identify the officers. Police officers “are public servants who, when on-duty, wield tremendous power to detain, arrest, jail, and, in extreme circumstances, employ deadly force in connection with their duties,” the groups said. “Without access to officer names, the public has no insight into whether certain officers have been the subject of multiple misconduct investigations or whether police oversight boards are effectively evaluating and responding to repeated misconduct complaints, particularly when such complaints are deemed unsubstantiated.” The officers have argued that they did nothing wrong and revealing their names would violate their privacy. But the media groups said their attendance at a public demonstration that drew thousands of people and news organizations was not a private activity. A message left for Mike Solan, the president of the Seattle Police Officer’s Guild, seeking comment was not immediately returned. Arguments before the Supreme Court are set for Nov. 9.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia internet customers are being asked to take a broadband speed test to improve access in the state. “Data collected from the speed test will be instrumental in making decisions about broadband access in West Virginia moving forward,” state Department of Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael said in a news release. Information from the tests will be used to create a map identifying where investment in broadband is needed most, the agency said. The test is available at broadband.wv.gov. Click the red button that reads “TAKE THE SPEED TEST” at the top of the page and follow the steps. A few additional questions about location and internet service follow the test, and the whole process takes about 5 minutes. The Broadband Enhancement Council is also involved in publicizing the speed test through a campaign using text messages and digital advertising.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Cardinal Raymond Burke, 73, one of Catholic Church’s most outspoken conservatives and a vaccine skeptic who was placed on a ventilator after contracting COVID-19, said he has moved into a house but is still struggling to recover from the disease. Burke posted a letter on his website Saturday saying he left a hospital Sept. 3 and moved into a house near his family. He didn’t say where. Burke said he’s going through in-home rehabilitation, still suffers from fatigue and has difficulty breathing. He didn’t detail what his rehabilitation regimen included but said he is making steady but slow progress. He said a secretary from Rome has moved in with him to help him with his rehabilitation and catch up on his work. “I cannot predict when I will be able to return to my normal activities,” Burke wrote. “Seemingly, it will be several more weeks.” He said God saved him for “some work” he wants him to carry out with the help of the church and asked people to pray for him, the world and the church, all of which are “beset with so much confusion and error to the great and even mortal harm of many souls.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Felicia, a mama grizzly bear whose troubles won the hearts of the Internet, has successfully shepherded her cubs through a perilous summer. Her fans miss seeing the bear family grazing and frolicking along Togwotee Pass. But they hope, for Felicia’s sake, that she will stay out of sight. This spring, record numbers of tourists were clogging the roads around Wyoming’s national parks when Felicia emerged from hibernation with two fuzzy, bumbling, roly-poly cubs, and established herself by the side of the highway. Passersby were mesmerized. Bear jams proliferated. The congestion wasn’t just a nuisance, however. Too many drivers were spotting Felicia and her cubs, swerving to the side of a 55 mph highway and leaving their cars to approach the bears – in violation of posted signs that forbade exactly that, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Three government agencies that watch over Felicia, the highway and the land she inhabited, lacked the resources to continually enforce parking laws or uphold the protections that grizzlies, a threatened species, are afforded under the Endangered Species Act. So rather than attempt to manage the people, officials managed the bear. Rangers typically use pain and noise to train bears to fear undesirable locations. That strategy, known as hazing, separated Felicia from her surviving cub for a month in 2019. Though the two ultimately reunited, the cub didn’t survive the following winter. Hazing, though less risky than relocation, isn’t a perfect solution. It can cause bears to act erratically around roads, increasing the risk of collisions. It can separate mothers from their cubs – sometimes temporarily, like with Felicia in 2019, and sometimes permanently. But it can also work. In Felicia’s case, hazing has been effective. Nearly four months after Felicia – known to rangers as grizzly 863 – fled a barrage of rubber bullets, beanbags and noisemakers, the bear has maintained her distance from roads, vehicles and people, and has kept her cubs by her side.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/11/fentanyl-fearmongering-evel-knievel-free-schoolhouse-news-around-states/118067782/", "title": "Fentanyl fearmongering, Evel Knievel: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state is racing toward coronavirus numbers it last saw at the peak of the pandemic, with more than 2,100 COVID-19 patients in state hospitals Monday and only 6% of intensive care unit beds available, a medical official said. Medical officials have said low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant have combined to cause an explosion of cases. “It’s like the California wildfires. We have the perfect environment,” said Dr. Don Williamson, Alabama’s former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association. The 2,134 hospitalized COVID-19 patients Monday included 33 children, according to numbers provided by the association. Nearly one-third of those patients, or 628, were in intensive care units and 318 on ventilators. Williamson said 42% of intensive care unit beds in the state were occupied by someone with COVID-19. The current hospitalization number of 2,134 is lower than the little more than 3,000 recorded at the peak of the pandemic in January. However, health officials have expressed concern about the steep upward trend. A month ago, there were 247 virus patients in state hospitals, according to numbers compiled from the Alabama Department of Public Health. “It’s filling up faster, and there is no end in sight,” Williamson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district says she has no intention to reexamine a policy requiring students and staff to wear masks indoors even though the new mayor has urged the district to “immediately reconsider” the plan. “Having schools open and students learning and engaging with peers is of the highest priority to me,” Superintendent Deena Bishop said in a statement Monday. She said that according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, “properly masked students will not be required to quarantine if deemed a close contact.” Mayor Dave Bronson, who took office July 1, has opposed COVID-19 restrictions and mask mandates, and criticizing the city’s previous restrictions was a central part of his mayoral campaign platform, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Bronson said in a social media post last Friday that he is against “mandates masking our residents and children.” “Anchorage residents should be free to make their own decisions about their health care, about their families, and about their children’s education,” Bronson said. “Therefore, I strongly oppose the Anchorage School District’s back to school mask mandate and strongly encourage them to immediately reconsider.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: University of Arizona President Dr. Robert C. Robbins on Monday criticized actions by the Legislature and the governor that limited the school’s power to combat COVID-19 on campus. “The ideal would be that we could require everyone to be vaccinated, we could require everyone to cover their face, we could require many things that other places are doing, but we cannot do (that) here because of state law,” Robbins said during a briefing on the school’s fall reopening plans. When Gov. Doug Ducey first signed an executive order banning mask and vaccine mandates at public universities June 15, Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, UA and the Arizona Board of Regents who oversee the state’s public university system, all said they would comply with governor’s directive. Later, those provisions were put into law as part of the budget. While some elementary and high school districts are defying those provisions, Arizona’s public universities are so far abiding by them. Referring to the mandate restrictions, Robbins said: “It’s removed some of the tools that would be effective in mitigating and fighting this virus.” Still, Robbins said classes at UA that are scheduled to begin in two weeks will go on as planned even as the delta variant causes case numbers to rise throughout the state.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court revived a legal challenge Monday to an Arkansas law that farm organizations have used to shield themselves from undercover investigations by animal rights groups. A three-judge panel of the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit. The Animal Legal Defense Fund and other animal rights organizations filed the suit in 2019 against Republican state Rep. DeAnn Vaught and her husband, who own a pig farm, and Peco Foods, an Alabama-based poultry farm with Arkansas facilities. Vaught also sponsored the 2017 law. The suit argues that the law, which bars undercover investigations at private businesses like large farms, violates the First Amendment by banning a form of speech. So-called ag-gag laws have been approved by legislatures in states with animal agriculture industries. A federal judge last year said the groups hadn’t shown they have suffered an actual injury because of the law. The Animal Legal Defense Fund and another plaintiff in the suit, Animal Equality, said they have plans to conduct undercover investigations of Peco’s facilities and the Vaughts’ pig farm but have refrained from doing so due to the law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A public safety video that told viewers a deputy had a near-death experience after being exposed to fentanyl used actual footage, the San Diego Sheriff’s department said Monday after critics questioned the deputy’s severe reaction. The unedited body-worn camera footage will be released within the week. The deputy was 6 inches from the powder July 3 while processing drugs at an arrest, according to an incident report from authorities. The dramatic, four-minute video drew criticism from health experts across the country after the sheriff’s department released it Thursday, questioning the deputy’s severe reaction and accusing Sheriff Bill Gore of fueling public misunderstanding. The Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for decriminalization and safe drug use policies, called the video irresponsible. “Content like this simply creates more fear and irrational panic that fuels further punitive responses to the overdose crisis, instead of the public health approach we need,” said Kassandra Frederique, the group’s executive director. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology said in a joint statement in 2017 that the risk of significant exposure to fentanyl is “extremely low” for emergency responders: “Toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State officials are investigating a county election office after passwords for its voting systems were posted online, the secretary of state announced Monday. The breach included specific passwords from Mesa County’s voting equipment, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement. The passwords were posted on a far-right blog, according to a spokesperson from Griswold’s office. She called it a “a serious breach” in a statement but said it did not happen during the past election or create any risk to state elections. It is likely that the passwords were collected during software updates to voting equipment in Mesa County on May 25, 2021, Griswold said. Officials have asked to inspect the county’s election equipment and other relevant materials from the county clerk and recorder. If violations are found, it could lead to a decertification of the county’s voting machines. Mesa County is a mostly rural county in western Colorado that includes the city of Grand Junction. State Republicans called for an audit into Dominion Voting Systems after the 2020 election, but elections officials have repeatedly denounced statements questioning Colorado’s election integrity, and Dominion has refuted claims about any deleted or changed votes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hartford and Stamford are mandating indoor mask-wearing amid another coronavirus surge fueled by the delta variant, city officials said Tuesday. Hartford’s requirement took effect at midnight Tuesday, and Stamford’s will begin at 8 a.m. Thursday, the mayors of both cities said. New Haven became the first city in Connecticut to mandate masks in indoor spaces Monday, after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont granted municipalities the authority to require masks. Lamont has not reimposed statewide mask requirements. Hartford’s rules will apply to anyone indoors in the city with exceptions for medical conditions, children under 2, people eating or drinking, and office spaces where work spaces are separated by partitions. Stamford will require mask-wearing at all indoor retail and public spaces regardless of vaccination status, as well as outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people at city-owned properties including parks, with similar exceptions. On Monday, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Connecticut rose above 200 for the first time since early May. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the state has risen over the past two weeks from about 220 on July 25 to about 540 on Sunday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Nearly a year and a half after businesses first started closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people across the state are still struggling to get the unemployment benefits they are due. Reports of fraudulent activity on unemployment claims have swamped the Delaware Labor Department over the past few months, and as a result legitimate applicants are being affected. It’s led to many people’s payments freezing as the department tries to get a hold over the phenomenon. The agency could not confirm how many people’s claims have been put on hold due to attempted fraud. But many of the people still on unemployment aren’t able to wait for the money, especially as pandemic-era government assistance programs such as an eviction moratorium begin to expire and the delta variant of the coronavirus poses a new chapter of economic uncertainty. “It couldn’t come at a worse time,” said Division of Unemployment Director Darryl Scott. Over the past year and a half, the unemployment process has been nothing short of a nightmare for many people in Delaware. The department processed more than 175,000 claims in 2020 compared to about 32,000 in 2019, overwhelming the small unemployment office with thousands of claims a week. Many were forced to wait weeks to months to see even a penny.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Tuesday that district government employees, including public school teachers, will be required to get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing, WUSA-TV reports. D.C. government employees will have until Sept. 19 to be fully vaccinated, Bowser said. Unvaccinated employees who qualify for a health or religious exemption or who choose not to be vaccinated will be required to take a weekly virus test. If they do not comply with the new policy, they will be subject to job penalities. About 54% of the 36,700 people employed by the D.C. government have already reported their COVID-19 status, Bowser said. The mayor, who spoke Tuesday alongside D.C. health officials and labor union representatives, clarified that the policy applies to all employees who work in agencies that report to her but highly encouraged all independent agencies to adopt the same vaccine requirement. D.C. government employees have been back in the office since July 11, Bowser said. And the city has been under an indoor mask mandate for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status, since July 31. As of Tuesday, the district had “substantial” transmission of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state’s higher-speed passenger rail service Brightline announced Tuesday that it will resume operating sometime in November, 20 months after it closed because of the pandemic and with safety measures that it hopes will curb a spate of fatal collisions that plagued its initial run. The privately run company, which began operations in 2017, will resume with hourly service between Miami and West Palm Beach, president Patrick Goddard said. Goddard said Brightline will require all employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, following federal regulations, mandate masks for crew and passengers inside its trains and stations. “We have learned a lot about how to live and travel in the pandemic. We now believe we are ready to open in a safe and healthy way,” Goddard said. Brightline suspended operations in March 2020 but continued laying track for its planned expansion from South Florida to Orlando and its theme parks. That route is set to open in late 2022 or early 2023. Goddard said Brightline will have spent $5 billion on its system when the Orlando leg is complete. Brightline then plans to open a line between Orlando and Tampa and one between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. When it reopens, Brightline will offer private and ride-share transportation to take passengers from their homes, offices and hotels to the station.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPelham: Residents say the local government isn’t doing enough to maintain a historically Black cemetery, but city leaders say they’re legally limited in upkeep because the city doesn’t own the property. Resident William Jeffalmond Jr. told WALB-TV that some graves in Pelham’s Liberia Cemetery are caving in, full of water and overgrown. “The ones I had to uncover, clearly over 100 graves I had to weed just so it could be identified,” Jeffalmond said. He said he used to work at the cemetery as a public works supervisor for Pelham. City Manager Craig Bennett said the cemetery was developed by Black churches and maintained by them for many years. In 2011, the city agreed to maintain the grounds, mowing the grass and cutting back vegetation. But Bennett said individual families own the plots, and the city doesn’t have the legal right to maintain crypts and gravestones. Bennett said the city is talking to the state and the Georgia Municipal Cemetery Association about what else it might be able to do.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The majority of the state’s roads and bridges are threatened by natural hazards and climate change, according to a state Department of Transportation report. The report says nearly 60% of the state’s roads and over 75% of its bridges are in danger of impacts from landslides, coastal erosion, sea level rise, storm surges, tsunamis and wildfires, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Hawaii Highways Climate Adaptation Action Plan identifies vulnerable areas and recommends solutions. Officials used historical data and climate projections to assess more than 900 miles of state-owned roads, including nearly 400 bridges and six tunnels. It is a “first step to act comprehensively across the agency in recognizing and considering more fully these changing climatic conditions,” Department of Transportation Deputy Director for Highways Ed Sniffen said a statement. Sniffen said the state “needs to be more resilient, adaptive, and engaged in climate change risks to our highway network.” Officials said rockfalls and landslides are a major concern, threatening 17% of roads, 32% of bridges, 15% of culverts, and all six of the state’s tunnels.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is facing unprecedented drought despite getting normal snow levels last winter, and water managers warn the state could be entering a multiyear drought. “Idaho is in the midst of a drought that is unprecedented in recent memory, mostly due to an exceptionally dry spring followed by a summer heat wave,” David Hoekema, hydrologist for the Idaho Department of Water Resources, wrote in a new analysis for the department, the Idaho Press reports. “Without a snowpack that is significantly greater than normal next winter, Idaho could be seeing several years with limited water supply.” Few saw this coming, as Idaho began the year with normal snowfall in the mountains, though temperatures were above normal every month but February. Then came a dry spring, followed by a blistering-hot summer. The state’s basins all experienced the hottest June and July on record, Hoekema said. “With storage being rapidly depleted across the state, concern is rising that we may be entering into a multiyear drought,” he said. Still, it’s not the driest year on record in Idaho. Hoekema said that came in 1977, which became known as “the year without snow.” Historically, Idaho’s drought years have followed winters with poor snowpack levels.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Fair begins Thursday, but among several new features this year will be an unwelcome one: COVID-19. With face mask and vaccination resistance simmering, the more transmissible delta coronavirus variant spreading, and a marked increase in cases of the disease that forced cancellation of last year’s fair, organizers of the 168-year-old tradition are emphasizing safety measures to thwart transmission of the persistent and potentially deadly virus. Six sites will offer free COVID-19 vaccinations during the fair’s run, through Aug. 22. But regardless of vaccination status, face coverings will be required indoors and at Grandstand performances, as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Agriculture Director Jerry Costello II said. And face masks will be encouraged when in a large crowd, such as at the kickoff Twilight Parade. A safe fair brings with it other more congenial attractions making debuts, including the Jetpack Flying Water Circus, in which acrobats perform 40 feet above a swimming pool, and the Dino-ROAR! exhibition, featuring live-action dinosaurs, including a growing T. Rex, strutting in an educational program. The World of Wonders is a “throwback to the old circus days with the sword swallowers, fire breathers and escape artists,” state fair manager Kevin Gordon said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State officials have lifted a moratorium on feeding birds in 76 counties as an investigation continues into how songbirds are dying. But people in Allen, Carroll, Clark, Floyd, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Johnson, Lake, Marion, Monroe, Morgan, Porter, St. Joseph, Tippecanoe and Whitley counties still should not feed birds, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources said Monday. The moratorium was recommended June 25 “to slow the spread of a still-undetermined illness that is killing birds across the state,” the DNR said in a release. “Based on the data, it appears that the bird illness is consistently affecting specific areas,” the DNR said. “There is no imminent threat to people, the population of specific bird species, or to the overall population of birds in Indiana.” Wildlife managers and veterinarians first received reports in late April and May of sick birds in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Washington, D.C. In addition to Indiana, other reports have come from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and Ohio. In Indiana, the sick songbirds were initially found in late May in southern Indiana’s Monroe County. The main visible symptoms are swollen eyes or crusty discharge around the eyes, as well as off-balance movements that may indicate neurological damage.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state has tossed out tens of thousands of expired COVID-19 vaccine doses and could toss out hundreds of thousands more if demand for the vaccine continues to lag, health officials said. Iowa Department of Public Health spokeswoman Sarah Ekstrand said Monday that the state has tossed more than 81,000 doses. “It’s so sad that we’re throwing away so many doses when we know the vaccine works,” said Rachel Reimer, chair of the Department of Public Health at Des Moines University, adding that millions of people in other countries are desperate to get the vaccine. “And we literally cannot give it away.” Federal officials have said states can’t return unused vaccines to the manufacturers or donate them to other states or countries, Ekstrand said. “We have exhausted all options prior to vaccine expiring,” she said in an email. The department warned last month that the state might have to discard about 217,000 doses by the end of August unless demand picked up. Health officials said they’ve seen a bump in demand for the vaccine recently, as coronavirus cases have surged over the summer. But demand is still far below what it was in April, when the shots first became available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: It appears the Evel Knievel Museum will be jumping out of the city. A Las Vegas newspaper reports the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, will move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Amanda Beach, the museum’s marketing director in Topeka, said Tuesday that the report was “a bit premature” but that the deal was “imminent.” The museum opened in Topeka in 2017. If the deal is finalized, the Topeka team would install and operate the museum in Las Vegas. The move is not going to happen immediately and could take a couple of years. “This museum deserves to be in a tourism destination, and I don’t think anyone would question that Las Vegas makes the most sense for the Evel Knievel Museum to be there with Evel’s history in that city,” Beach said. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports developer J Dapper said Monday that he would work with landlord Jonathan Kermani to move the museum.\n\nKentucky\n\nClermont: Bourbon producer Jim Beam has achieved a pandemic-era production milestone by filling 1 million barrels during the COVID-19 outbreak. Production at the James B. Beam Distilling Co. is accelerating in response to growing demand, and last week it celebrated filling its 17 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, the company said. The 1 million barrel production milestone during the coronavirus outbreak holds “special significance” because it was accomplished despite disruptions and new protocols to protect employees, the spirits industry giant said. “Throughout this pandemic, our incredible teams kept coming in to work every day, to make the bourbon that consumers around the world are going to enjoy in about four years,” said Freddie Noe, the eighth-generation Beam distiller. “They adjusted to new workplace protocols that kept them, their colleagues and our operations safe – and they did this while caring for loved ones at home.” Bourbon ages for years before reaching consumers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s top higher education board on Tuesday enacted the rules governing how college campuses must respond to and report sexual misconduct and harassment complaints, with training for school administrators scheduled for next week. The regulations adopted by the Board of Regents stem from new laws passed by the Legislature in response to a searing independent report that documented years of Louisiana State University’s mishandling of student allegations of rape, assault and abuse covered under federal Title IX laws. Lawmakers enacted several measures spelling out who is required to report “power-based violence” allegations and what steps must be followed for dealing with any claims. The Board of Regents rules detail how those requirements work for campuses, set reporting deadlines and issue training mandates – regulations that board members enacted more quickly than the law required. “We felt it was critical to have the new policy in place before our campuses reopen for the fall semester in the next few weeks. And while the law prescribed a January deadline for having these new policies in place, we have training scheduled for next week,” said board Chairman Blake David. “There’s no time to waste when it comes to protecting our students.”\n\nMaine\n\nMeddybemps: The state plans to transfer ownership of a culturally significant parcel of land back to the Passamaquoddy tribe. The land is a 3.2-acre waterfront parcel located in the Washington County town of Meddybemps. Members of the tribe refer to the land as N’tolonapemk, which means “our relatives’ place.” Rena Newell of Sipayik, the state representative for the Passamaquoddy tribe, led a ceremony commemorating the return of the land to the tribe earlier this month. Newell said the transfer of the land is a significant moment for the tribe. The land is located on Passamaquoddy ancestral lands and was used for travel by canoe for millennia. Democratic House Speaker Ryan Fecteau called the transfer of land the “beginning of the work to realize tribal sovereignty and right wrongs.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Members of the state’s congressional delegation are asking for more federal resources to fight crime in Baltimore. They made the request in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday, saying while Baltimore has high crime rates, federal law enforcement levels are “significantly smaller than those located in neighboring jurisdictions.” U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen signed the letter, along with Reps. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes and Kweisi Mfume. They did not cite specific figures regarding staffing levels but said Washington, D.C., has a “significantly larger” number of federal agents investigating violent crime. In addition to asking for a reevaluation of federal staffing resources, the Democratic officials asked specifically for 10 additional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents, 15 more U.S. Marshals, five new assistant U.S. attorneys, additional grants and other resources. The request follows a meeting last month among members of the delegation and Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison and Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan Lenzner.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Runners at this weekend’s Falmouth Road Race will be required to wear surgical masks at the starting line, although they will be allowed to remove them while on the 7-mile course, race organizers said. The starting-line masks are among several precautionary measures organizers are using to stem the potential spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus as the race resumes after a one-year hiatus because of the pandemic. “We’ve taken extra steps to keep people safe,” said Dr. John Jardine, the race’s medical program coordinator. On the course, runners are being asked to avoid running in packs and to maintain a 3-foot distance between individuals. Masks will also be required in most indoor areas, including buses that take runners to Woods Hole, as well as medical tents. Water station volunteers will wear gloves. There will also be no finish-line gathering. This year’s race, scheduled for Sunday, has 8,000 registered runners, down from the typical 12,800 participants.\n\nMichigan\n\nColumbus Township: A piece of St. Clair County history is searching for a new home. Residents may recognize an old schoolhouse at Gratiot Avenue and Palms Road sporting a new sign: “Preserve history by saving the Pink School House. Free to a good home.” The schoolhouse has served as the front office for Superior Heating & Cooling Inc. since 1995, when owner Pete Cervini purchased the building with business partner Tim Grace. “We were looking for some space ... this building was vacant,” Cervini said. “It looked like a nice location; the price was right.” He said the building had been vacant for a while, and locals were happy to see it being used, asking to come inside and look around. When Cervini acquired the abandoned schoolhouse, the desks, chalkboards and an old gravity furnace were still in the building. While the old wooden desks and chairs were donated, the chalkboards are still there, Cervini said. In 1997, the company had another structure built out back for storage and shop space. After more than 20 years spent working out of the schoolhouse, Cervini had another office built to connect with the shop out back. However, the new office and the schoolhouse are too close together. The township asked Cervini to either move the schoolhouse or remove it, he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A gun owners’ group sued the Minnesota State Fair and Ramsey County on Tuesday, demanding that permit holders be allowed to carry handguns on the fairgrounds during the Great Minnesota Get-Together. The lawsuit filed by the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus in Ramsey County District Court argues that the State Fair’s ban on weapons violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The plaintiffs also include a preacher and a group member who say they want to carry their guns for self-defense when they visit the fair. The lawsuit asks the court to order that Minnesotans who have valid carry permits be allowed to carry pistols at the fair and that the sheriff’s office, which will provide law enforcement at this year’s fair, be prohibited from enforcing the ban. Spokespeople for the State Fair and the sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit argues that the State Fair, run by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society, is subject to the same state laws that allow permit holders to bring their guns into the State Capitol and other public places. And it says those laws supersede local regulations. The Minnesota State Fair opens Aug. 26 and runs through Labor Day.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A swimming pool and splash pad near the capital city have been closed after the state health department said it found several cases of a bacterial infection associated with the facility. The Mississippi State Department of Health said Monday that it continues to investigate the E. coli infections found in connection with use of the swimming pool and splashpad at the Jellystone Park Camp Resort-Yogi on the Lake in Pelahatchie. An E. coli infection can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, fever and sometimes more severe symptoms that can be life-threatening, according to the health department. Infection symptoms usually develop within three to four days after exposure. The agency said it has tracked infections to July 30 and Aug. 1 but believes additional exposures could have happened through Monday, before the pool and splashpad were closed. It urged people who used either the pool or splashpad during that time to monitor for symptoms and speak to a doctor immediately if any appear. The health department said the camp’s management is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state turned 200 years old Tuesday, commemorating its birthday with art, music, speeches, free ice cream and – fittingly – the recognition of new citizens in a state that once served as the gateway for westward expansion in the United States. A bicentennial ceremony at the state Capitol marked the pinnacle of a year’s worth of events in every county intended to draw attention to Missouri’s history while also looking toward its future. At its founding, most of Missouri’s residents had immigrated from other states or countries because of the promise of rich, available farmland. But some were brought to the state as slaves, and some Native Americans were driven out of their homeland. Those who spoke at the bicentennial event acknowledged Missouri’s history contains both praiseworthy and regrettable moments. But overall, “we are a good people,” Missouri Chief Justice Paul Wilson said Tuesday, looking over a crowd of several hundred people spread across the Capitol lawn. “We’ve shone more often than we’ve blushed. We’ve been a force for light more often than we’ve been the cause of darkness.” Thirty-three people from 19 countries took the oath of U.S. citizenship inside the Capitol, where new Missouri-themed artwork was on display.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The city has an agreement to buy a 21-unit apartment building that provides affordable housing for people living with mental illness or disabilities, the city said Monday. The Western Montana Mental Health Center built the apartment building in 1998 with public funds, but restrictions on the building’s use based on that funding have expired. The center’s board decided earlier this year to move away from offering housing to clients. CEO Levi Anderson said officials couldn’t find someone to buy the building to continue to provide low-income housing, so they put it on the market for nearly $2.2 million. Missoula and another buyer put in offers, and the center initially accepted the other offer, drawing anger from Mayor John Engen. The other buyer backed out for undisclosed reasons, and the city is now working to purchase the building through the Missoula Redevelopment Agency. “One of the most effective ways to house folks is to ensure that they’re not homeless to begin with,” Engen said in a statement. “Our agreement with Western guarantees long-term, stable housing for residents who would otherwise be exceptionally vulnerable in Missoula’s tight real-estate market.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A coalition of advocacy groups and state senators announced a new ballot drive Monday to raise Nebraska’s minimum wage to $15 an hour, up from the current $9 an hour that voters approved through a similar ballot initiative in 2014. Raise the Wage Nebraska said the move would benefit communities across the state. If enough signatures are gathered, the issue will appear on the 2022 general election ballot. The announcement comes after a proposal in the Legislature to set the wage at $20 an hour by 2032 stalled this year. “Poverty is at the root of many of the issues we are trying to tackle in our state,” state Sen. Terrell McKinney, a co-sponsor of the ballot campaign, said in a statement. “One way to begin decreasing poverty is to raise the minimum wage and change the cycle of surviving the good life to living the good life.” The measure is likely to face opposition from business groups, although none actively campaigned against the effort that increased Nebraska’s minimum wage to $9 in 2016. Before the phased-in 2014 ballot measure went into effect, Nebraska’s rate matched the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If the $15-an-hour measure passes, Nebraska would have the highest minimum wage among its neighboring states, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A landlord argued with his live-in tenants over unpaid rent before opening fire with a handgun at a small house near downtown early Tuesday, killing two women and wounding a man who suffered nine gunshot wounds, police said. The suspect, a man in his late 70s, surrendered after a standoff with police who arrived about 12:30 a.m. to find one woman dead outside the pink, one-story home and the wounded man coming out the door, police Lt. Ray Spencer said. Police SWAT officers found the second woman dead inside the house, Spencer said. The names of the dead women and the wounded man, all in their 50s, were not immediately made public. The man was hospitalized in critical condition and was expected to survive, Spencer said. Police confiscated a 9 mm handgun, and the homeowner was being questioned. He was expected to be jailed pending a court appearance on murder and attempted murder charges, Spencer said. The suspect’s identity was not immediately released. “There was a dispute that started yesterday over money that was owed for rent,” Spencer said. “We don’t know the specifics, but information from witnesses is that it’s all over money not paid for their portion of the rent.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill intended to crack down on those who assault children could have unintentionally made it harder to prosecute those who harm adults, Gov. Chris Sununu said Tuesday in vetoing the legislation. Under current law, charges must be brought within six years of first- or second-degree assaults, regardless of the victim’s age. The Legislature passed a bill to expand the statute of limitations to allow for prosecution for assaults against children up until a victim turns 24, but prosecutors say the language could be interpreted as prohibiting prosecutions in cases in which victims are over age 24. Attorney General John Formella and all 10 county attorneys wrote to Sununu last week expressing concern about the bill, saying cases with adult victims over age 24 “simply would not be able to be charged or prosecuted.” Sununu said in his veto message that he supports the bill’s intent and encouraged the Legislature to rewrite it next year. “Occasionally, well-intentioned legislation can fall apart because of a few misplaced words or technical language that was left out,” he wrote. “Unfortunately House Bill 239 contains a fatal flaw that must prevent it from moving forward.” Sununu also vetoed two bills that would have eliminated the state police “gun line” and put the FBI solely in charge of background checks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: To protect inmates in the state’s only women’s prison from sexual abuse, the U.S. Justice Department and the state Department of Corrections reached an agreement to install an independent monitor, among other reforms, officials said Tuesday. The agreement, which must still be approved by a federal judge before taking effect, calls for the establishment of confidential methods for inmates to report sexual abuse, as well as protections against retaliation for reporting abuse. The accord also requires more transparency through public meetings with stakeholders, including one-time prisoners at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women. The Justice Department issued a report in April 2020 finding that state official running the prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from sexual abuse, despite being aware of systemic problems. Then came news that in January 2021 that guards at the prison conducted violent raids on inmates in which some were punched and pepper-sprayed, according to authorities and video released from officials’ cameras. The state attorney general had called the cell extractions a brutal attack, and 10 guards face criminal charges.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Customers are sounding the alarm over a proposed multibillion-dollar merger of the state’s largest electric utility provider with a U.S. subsidiary of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, citing a sordid track record of reliability and customer service. They voiced their concerns during a virtual hearing Monday as state regulators prepare to hear from attorneys and experts representing Public Service Co. of New Mexico, Connecticut-based Avangrid, and other groups that have intervened in a case that has the potential to change the way electricity is generated and distributed in the state. The companies have been running television, radio and newspaper ads in an effort to win more support. Some politicians, environmental groups and labor union bosses have signed on, but others say regulators need to consider Avangrid and Iberdrola’s histories when it comes to providing reliable service in other states and parts of Latin America where they operate. Critics also pointed to Avangrid’s efforts to rollback provisions of a rooftop solar program in Maine. “We feel past performance is a better indicator of future performance than ads and promises,” said Paul Gibson, co-founder of the statewide advocacy group Retake Our Democracy.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A year after depending on drive-in and virtual screenings, the New York Film Festival, one of the premier destinations of the fall festival circuit, will return to in-person premieres at Lincoln Center this September, with vaccination proof required for all attendees. Film at Lincoln Center, which presents the annual festival, announced the lineup to the 59th NYFF on Tuesday. It will include virtual events and some outdoor screenings but forgo virtual screenings. Organizers said that decision was “in response to distributor and filmmaker partners and in light of festivals returning and theaters reopening across the country.” Dennis Lim, the festival’s director of programming, called the lineup “a reminder of cinema’s world-making possibilities” that “help us make sense of our moment.” The festival will kick off with the previously announced world premiere of Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” with Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” which will first debut at Venice, is the festival’s centerpiece. Pedro Almodovar’s “Parallel Mothers” will close the festival a few weeks after it premieres at the Venice Film Festival opener.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Interest in COVID-19 vaccines has surged in the week since the governor announced that his administration would boost the financial incentive from $25 to $100 for unvaccinated residents who come in for their first shot this month. While a number of factors are contributing to people’s decision to get vaccinated, including the rising spread of the more contagious delta variant, state health officials are hopeful even more people will choose to get vaccinated now that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has decided to follow President Joe Biden’s advice to give out $100 rewards. “Many of our providers distributed all of their cards in a single day after we announced the shift to $100 last week,” said Catie Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Human Services. “One of our providers went from distributing 1,000 cards per week to 3,000 in two days.” Drivers who take people in for their first shot remain eligible for one $25 prepaid credit card, while those who get the shot can now receive four cards in $25 denominations. Armstrong said the department has worked to remove from its website the vaccination sites where providers have run out of cash cards, though she said supplies should soon be replenished.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has requested federal help for counties dealing with recent storms that caused more than $2 million in damage to roads and other infrastructure. The storms during the second week of June produced tornadoes and up to baseball-sized hail, caused flooding, and included damaging winds of up to 93 mph. Because North Dakota is experiencing one of the worst droughts on record, the torrential rain that caused flooding was only made worse because dried-out topsoil was nearly impermeable. Burgum is asking that the Federal Emergency Management Agency issue a major disaster declaration for eight counties: Burke, Divide, Emmons, Grant, Kidder, LaMoure, Sioux and Williams. If granted, a presidential declaration would unlock FEMA public assistance to help cities, counties and townships pay for the costs of repairing roads and other infrastructure. “These unrelenting storms caused extensive damage to homes and businesses, damaged roads and bridges, and snapped power poles and downed power lines, cutting off service to several communities,” Burgum said. The governor also on Monday issued an executive order mobilizing state resources to help local and tribal officials.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Leaders of Black faith organizations, labor groups, current and former judges, and social activists are highlighting two sentences handed down in Cuyahoga County Court last week as justification for changes to the state’s sentencing system. In one case, a Black woman received 18 months in prison for stealing $42,000 from a suburban school where she was a secretary. In another case, a white woman received probation after stealing nearly $250,000 from the village where she worked as a clerk, cleveland.com reports. “Are we satisfied with a system that would allow for two extremely different results like this?” said Ohio Supreme Court Justice Michael Donnelly, a proponent of a statewide sentencing database that’s currently under construction with a goal of more uniform sentences for defendants. Judges weighing a sentence could enter multiple factors into the database, such as the number of victims in a crime or whether restitution was paid, and then draft a sentence by comparing it to those given in similar cases statewide. Ten of 34 Cuyahoga County judges have agreed to participate in the Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission project, as have all judges in Summit County, home to Akron. The majority of state judges have yet to sign on.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Tens of thousands of students returned to class Monday, but Oklahoma City Public Schools leaders said parents of the youngest grade levels are still showing hesitancy to enroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer than 27,000 students arrived for the first day of school districtwide. Schools expect numbers to climb in the coming weeks, potentially to 30,000, administrators said. Losses have been heaviest among pre-K and kindergarten classes since the pandemic began. Pre-enrollment rates indicated another year of depressed early childhood numbers. Only 1,304 children were enrolled in pre-K and kindergarten on Friday in a district that typically registers 2,600, said Jamie Polk, assistant superintendent of elementary schools. Although pre-K is optional in Oklahoma, it’s crucial to establishing a foundation of vocabulary and literacy, Polk said. “We just don’t know right now what the outcome will be when students do not have that formal education because of the pandemic,” she said. “We would rather have them with us in order for us to at least guide them via in-person, brick-and-mortar (schooling) or virtually. It’s just too important.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A lawsuit filed in Oregon Appellate Court last week is challenging the efforts of staff within the Legislature to unionize. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Freedom Foundation – a group that combats public-sector unions in Oregon, Washington and California – is seeking judicial review of the state Employment Relations Board’s ruling that cleared the way for legislative staff to vote to unionize in late May. Jason Dudash, Oregon director of the Freedom Foundation, said he believes the idea of a union is “fundamentally incompatible” with the work of the Legislature. “Unionizing legislative assistants will compromise the integrity of the legislative branch and erode trust by the people toward their elected lawmakers,” Dudash said in a statement Friday. The group argues that the bargaining unit representing legislative assistants is in conflict with the state law dividing power among Oregon’s three branches of government. The argument is nearly identical to one made by the Oregon Legislature itself last December when it objected to unionization efforts organized by staffers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: About 25,000 employees of prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities have about a month to get vaccinated against COVID-19 or take weekly tests for the coronavirus, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday. Wolf said workers in those jobs – and all new hires at those facilities – have until Sept. 7 to get fully vaccinated. In addition to the Corrections Department, the requirement applies to state hospitals, veterans’ homes, community health centers, prisons, and homes for those with intellectual disabilities. The state Health Department said this week that 63.8% of adult state residents are fully vaccinated, although there were nearly 4,100 new cases over a recent three-day stretch. So far, more than 1.2 million Pennsylvanians have been infected with the coronavirus, and nearly 28,000 have died from it. The two-week moving average of cases has been on the rise in Pennsylvania, where daily vaccinations have recently averaged about 14,000 people. Starting Oct. 1, all state workers who prove they are fully vaccinated will also be given an extra day off of work as an incentive to increase the vaccination rate. Wolf has said he does not expect to require schoolchildren to wear masks as the academic year approaches.\n\nRhode Island\n\nScituate: Anyone who has ever wanted to know what it’s like to be a Rhode Island State Police trooper now has their chance. The agency is accepting applications through Sept. 17 for the 2021 Rhode Island State Police Citizens Academy. People can sign up at the agency’s website, but space is limited, the department said in a statement. The program includes briefings and hands-on experience in areas including training, officer safety, patrol operations and procedures, response to resistance, domestic violence investigations, victim assistance, and investigative techniques. Participants will also learn about the different divisions, including Professional Standards/Internal Affairs Unit, Community Diversity and Equity Unit, Patrol Bureau, Detective Bureau, Legal and other specialized units. The academy will be held every Monday evening from Sept. 27 through Nov. 1 at department headquarters and the training academy. Presenters include commander Col. James Manni and state Attorney General Peter Neronha. “The academy is an opportunity for us to strengthen our relationship with the people we serve by improving communication and sharing a deeper understanding of the challenges and demands we face every day,” Manni said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Court hearings are being held outdoors after flooding revealed mold inside the city’s municipal court building. The building that houses Greenville Municipal Court remains closed after broken water and sewage lines revealed mold damage. Tents have been set up for court hearings on the front lawn of the downtown building, and they’re expected to be used throughout the week. Repairs are still ongoing inside the court building, which was built in 1946. The building has terra cotta clay pipes for parts of its plumbing that became affected by underground roots, city spokeswoman Beth Brotherton said. That created a blockage and sewage backup.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Teachers, educators and other citizens charged with crafting new state social studies standards said Tuesday that Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration deleted many elements intended to bolster students’ understanding of Native American history and culture from their draft standards. Members of the working group – appointed by the Department of Education to review and update the standards – said they were caught by surprise Friday when the department released a document with significant changes. New standards are released every seven years. They said changes made to the draft they submitted in late July gave it a political edge they had tried to avoid, instead aligning with the Republican governor’s rhetoric on what she calls patriotic education. The working group’s draft recommended including Native American culture from Oceti Sakowin stories in kindergarten and studying tribal banking systems in high school, but the department cut many of those recommendations. “Here we are again; the Native population is not worthy of being taught,” said Sherry Johnson, the education director with the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and a member of the working group. “I feel it’s important for all students to learn. This is how you combat racism and you build resiliency.”\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival announced Tuesday that its festivalgoers will be required to show proof that they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of attending the event. The four-day festival in Manchester starts Sept. 2. It was delayed for more than a year due by the coronavirus pandemic. “The safety of our patrons and staff is our number one priority,” Bonnaroo officials said in statement said, adding that the last day to receive the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine and be fully protected is Aug. 19. Chicago’s Lollapalooza music festival announced a similar requirement earlier this year. Like Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo will require attendees to present their vaccination cards. If they don’t, individuals must have a copy of a negative virus test within 72 hours of entering the festival’s hub, known as “Centeroo.” Bonnaroo will offer rapid testing for $40 if patrons miss the 72-hour window or do not have their vaccination card. Unvaccinated attendees are asked to wear masks. Tennessee has seen 12,837 COVID-19 related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. Meanwhile, over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by nearly 163%.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott appealed for out-of-state help to fight the third wave of COVID-19 as two more of the state’s largest school districts announced mask mandates in defiance of the Republican governor. Abbott’s request Monday came as a county-owned hospital in Houston raised tents to accommodate its COVID-19 overflow. Private hospitals in the county already were requiring their staffs to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Meanwhile, the Dallas and Austin school districts announced Monday that they would require students and staff to wear face masks. The Houston district already announced a mask mandate for its students and staff later this week if its board approves. The highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus is fueling the wave. Abbott has directed the Texas Department of State Health Services to use staffing agencies to find additional medical staff from beyond the state’s borders as the delta wave begins to overwhelm present staffing resources. He also has sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Association to request that hospitals postpone all elective medical procedures voluntarily. Hospital officials in Houston said last week that area hospitals with beds had insufficient numbers of nurses to serve them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A 7-year-old boy died from burns he received after he and a friend played with matches, according to authorities. Salt Lake City police officials said the two boys were melting a fence with matches and an accelerant Saturday night, KSL-TV reports. The boy’s clothes caught fire, and a neighbor wrapped a blanket around him to extinguish the flames. Almost all of the boy’s body was severely burned. He was taken to Primary Children’s Hospital in critical condition and later died. The boy’s friend, a 9-year-old boy, was not injured.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state will require that government employees who work with vulnerable populations be vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. Scott said he changed his mind about requiring the vaccines for a portion of the state workforce because of how the highly transmissible delta strain of the coronavirus is responsible for most new cases in the state. “It’s shown how quickly it can spread,” Scott said of the delta variant during his regular Tuesday virus briefing. “We have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable, those under our care, and I think those in the veterans’ home, the psychiatric hospital, as well as the offenders in the correctional facilities, they are under our care.” Scott said there would be “some sort of an exit ramp” for those who don’t want to be vaccinated, perhaps regular coronavirus testing or something else that hasn’t been determined yet. Scott said he did not know about how many state employees the requirement would cover. He also said he did not expect to have to expand that requirement to other state employees.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A plan by police to install cameras that capture every passing license plate in neighborhoods where residents and visitors are mostly Black and brown is sparking concerns among critics who see cameras as an invasive way to surveil already overpoliced neighborhoods, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The Richmond Police Department plans to install readers in Southwood, where census tract data shows the area is 48% Hispanic and 38% Black; Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority properties, which are largely Black neighborhoods; and other locations. Police say the locations haven’t been finalized. The areas were determined using crime trends, input from officers and command staff, and site surveys throughout the city, the department said in an email responding to the newspaper’s questions. Last month, Housing Authority Public Safety Director Brian Swann told the authority’s property management committee that police would install three or four cameras, which could be moved as needed. The license place readers would help solve violent crime in the communities, Swann said, though he added that crime, which is up citywide, was down across authority properties.\n\nWashington\n\nKingston: A new community health center for the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe opened Monday, offering health and wellness services to tribal members. The Port Gamble S’Klallam Health Center is a 22,500-square-foot centralized space that is focused on a holistic approach to the health care of the tribe. All existing medical, dental and wellness services are now housed in the new building for the convenience of the patients. The health center has 10 exam rooms and 11 consultation rooms for medical services. In dentistry, there are six stations and a private operatory suite. Both departments have been fitted with new medical equipment. The original community clinic, located directly in front of the new health center, has been converted into a fitness center that will offer physical and massage therapy, acupuncture, X-ray imaging and a gym. Jolene Sullivan, PGST’s health services director, said she hopes the community will be drawn to utilize all the services offered as a form of preventative care. “I think we’re all excited – the community is even excited about offering those things and having them available here,” Sullivan said. The Port Gamble S’Klallam Health Center held its grand opening Friday, attended by Gov. Jay Inslee and his wife, Trudi.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBuckhannon: West Virginia Wesleyan College says it will charge a $750 fee to students who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 for the fall semester. The school in Buckhannon also said in its campus arrival guidance for the upcoming semester that students who come down with the coronavirus and can’t quarantine off campus will be charged $250 to do so on campus, WDTV-TV reports. The nonrefundable $750 fee will be charged to students who don’t submit proof of full vaccination or their first shot by Sept. 7, the college said on its website. “The fee is going to be used to cover the expenses that will come with increased testing and other resources that the college will have to utilize and deploy to keep every student safe,” Dean James Moore said. Unvaccinated students, faculty and staff are required to wear a mask indoors and maintain a social distance, the school said. Unvaccinated students will be required to take a weekly virus test.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Opioid overdoses in the state have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to a report the Department of Health Services released Tuesday. The analysis shows the rate of overdose incidents rose from about 7 per 100,000 people in January 2019 to about 13 per 100,000 people this past March. Overdoses spiked in May 2020 to about 15 per 100,000 people. Stress from the pandemic, a statewide stay-at-home order, increased access to drugs and social isolation may have led to more dangerous drug behaviors, the report said. The data shows overdoses rose sharply during the pandemic’s onset, then decreased and now appear to be rising again. DHS officials said they plan to use $10.4 million that Wisconsin won as part of a multistate settlement to launch prevention programs for Black and American Indian communities, create health teams that will travel to areas of the state experiencing opioid spikes, reimburse counties for the costs of treating addicts, and cover housing for people in recovery. The settlement, reached in February, resolved allegations that consulting firm McKinsey & Company contributed to the opioid crisis by advising opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma on how to maximize profits by urging physicians to prescribe more OxyContin to patients.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Some local Republican Party officials have announced they will no longer recognize U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney as a party member because of her vote to impeach Donald Trump. “In the immortal words of the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump …‘You’re Fired!’ ” read recent letters to Cheney from GOP officials in Park and Carbon counties. Wyoming has 23 mainly rural counties, and the officials in Park and Carbon counties voted unanimously over the past week in favor of the latest form of censure against Cheney. In February, the state GOP voted overwhelmingly to censure Cheney for her vote to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. In May, Republicans in Washington, D.C., voted to remove Cheney from her No. 3 House GOP leadership position after she maintained criticism of Trump for the riot and for his baseless assertions that voter fraud deprived him of reelection. The Wyoming votes are largely symbolic. The Republican Party can withdraw or withhold support from GOP officeholders and candidates in a variety of ways but can’t oust anybody from the party.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/28/prairie-power-beer-pig-bystander-honor-news-around-states/50782545/", "title": "Prairie power, beer pig: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A coastal environmental group filed suit Monday trying to block a decision by Alabama Power Co. to leave millions of tons of coal ash along a riverside in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, where opponents say a spill could devastate a huge ecosystem. The federal lawsuit by Mobile Baykeeper was filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which announced plans to sue the electrical utility in July. The group wants to force Alabama Power to give up what it contends is an illegal plan to permanently leave more than 21 million tons of coal ash in an unlined pit at Plant Barry, located north of Mobile along the Mobile River. Environmentalists argue the ash pond is polluting groundwater and could destroy a verdant, biologically diverse region should it be breached by heavy flooding, a hurricane or some other disaster. “Plant Barry is the only coal ash lagoon of a major utility left in a low-lying coastal area of the Southeast that is not already cleaned up or on track to be recycled or removed to safe storage, away from waterways,” Barry Brock, director of the law center’s Alabama office, said in a statement. Alabama Power declined to comment on the lawsuit. Plant Barry opened in 1965 about 25 miles north of Mobile. The company contends moving the material farther away from the plant site would pose a hazard in itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A U.S. Coast Guard ship on routine patrol in the Bering Sea came across a guided missile cruiser from China, officials said Monday. But it turned out the cruiser wasn’t alone as it sailed about 86 miles north of Alaska’s Kiska Island on Sept. 19. The patrol boat, known as a cutter called Kimball, later discovered there were two other Chinese naval ships and four Russian naval vessels, including a destroyer, all in single formation. The Honolulu-based Kimball, a 418-foot vessel, observed as the ships broke formation and dispersed. A C-130 Hercules provided air support for the Kimball from the Coast Guard station in Kodiak. “While the formation has operated in accordance with international rules and norms, we will meet presence with presence to ensure there are no disruptions to U.S. interests in the maritime environment around Alaska,” Rear Adm. Nathan Moore, Seventeenth Coast Guard District commander said. The Coast Guard said Operation Frontier Sentinel guidelines call for meeting “presence with presence” when strategic competitors operate in and around U.S. waters. The Kimball will continue to monitor the area. The Chinese and Russian formation came a month after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned about China’s interest in the Arctic and Russia’s military buildup there.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher system will likely go into effect after public school advocates failed to gather enough signatures to block the law, a conservative think tank that supports the expansion said Monday. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank in Phoenix, said Save Our Schools Arizona “submitted just 88,866 signatures, according to petition sheets made available by the Secretary of State’s office.” That’s “significantly short of the requisite 118,843 signatures needed to overturn the reform via ballot referendum.” Although Save Our Schools Arizona said it “will await accurate numbers” from the Secretary of State’s office regarding its challenge to the law, the head of the grassroots group acknowledged it’s probably well below the threshold. Monday’s developments appear to be a major victory for “school choice” advocates in Arizona and across the nation who argue that parents should be able to use public tax dollars to send their children to schools that best serve their needs. Voucher opponents say they drain money from long-underfunded public schools that serve the vast majority of children, sending public money to unaccountable private and religious schools and mainly benefiting the wealthy.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Deer season for archery is underway in western Arkansas, though drought may have affected the population and growth of deer this summer. A healthy population of deer and bear has been noted by those in the field during the opening days since the season began Saturday. Lack of vegetation can affect growth of deer during a drought. Young bucks may have smaller antlers, wildlife experts say, should the drought persist. That has not been the case in Arkansas this year. But the deer harvest this year in western Arkansas should be strong because the drought did not start until mid- to late June, said Ralph Meeker, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s statewide deer program coordinator. The does were able to produce enough milk for fawns that can adapt. The number of deer harvested could increase because visibility increases for hunters when drought causes foliage to die off, taking away the cover for the deer. But the deer so far are healthy, Meeker said. Antler growth has not been affected, he has observed. “Whitetail deer are a very adaptable species,” Meeker said. “We had a good growing season before the drought started in mid to late June. Fawn production was phenomenal.” The bear population – for which archery season is underway – has also reportedly increased this year in western Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Beyond what they learn academically in kindergarten, students learn everyday routines: how to take care of class materials and how to be kind to their peers, according to Golden Empire Elementary School kindergarten teacher Carla Randazzo. And nearly two-thirds of students at the Sacramento school are English learners. “Those kids just start out having to climb uphill,” she said. “They need a lot of support to be successful.” Randazzo always thought it was “peculiar” that kindergarten is not mandatory in the state. For now, though, California won’t join 20 other states with mandatory kindergarten. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed legislation Sunday night that would have required children to attend kindergarten – whether through home-schooling or public or private school – before entering first grade at a public school. As he has with other recent legislative vetoes, Newsom cited the costs associated with providing mandatory kindergarten, about $268 million annually, which he said was not accounted for in the California budget. Newsom had supported similar legislation in the past. Proponents of mandatory kindergarten say it could help close the academic opportunity gap for low-income students and students of color, as well as help children develop important social skills before the first grade. Kindergarten enrollment in California dropped nearly 12% in the 2020-21 academic year compared to the previous year, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A bystander who intervened during the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia has been recognized as the only one who “did the right thing.” Reidesel Mendoza had stopped his car to confront the police officers arresting 73-year-old Karen Garner on June 26, 2020, because “the way they were handling that situation was not the right way,” he said in an interview Sept. 17, after receiving a citizenship award for his actions that day. Garner was accused of leaving Walmart without paying for $13.88 worth of merchandise, but staff stopped her and retrieved the items before she left. Garner was walking home when Officer Austin Hopp stopped her, soon forcing Garner to the ground and trying to arrest her. Mendoza saw how Hopp and two other officers were treating Garner and decided he needed to intervene. “Do you have to use that much aggression?” Mendoza could be heard saying in Hopp’s body camera footage. Hopp told him: “Get out of here; this is not your business ... this is what happens when you fight the police.” Mendoza continued to speak up. The award was presented in part by the Community Trust Commission, formed by the Loveland City Council to aid in rebuilding trust with the community and its police department. Interim Loveland Police Chief Eric Stewart applauded Mendoza’s courage in stepping up that day and said the public plays a key role in successful policing. “We certainly didn’t do a great job that day,” Stewart said. “I’m sorry we let you down that day.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Ian Hockley testified Tuesday that he was ridiculed online as a “party boy” and an actor after posting a video of the memorial service for his 6-year-old son, who was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Hockley is the latest family member of the 26 victims of the shooting to testify at the defamation trial of Alex Jones, in which a jury is deciding how much the conspiracy theorist must pay for spreading the lie that the shooting was a hoax. Hockley, who lost his autistic son, Dylan, in the shooting, testified that he became the target of conspiracy theorists because he smiled during what he found as an uplifting memorial service. “That is what that video started to attract is people saying this must be fake,” he said. “ ‘He’s an actor. He’s smiling. Oh, you’re out of character’ – all of those things started to appear until we took our video down.” Earlier in the trial, other victims’ relatives gave often emotional testimony describing how they endured death threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media by people calling the shooting a hoax. Some moved to avoid the abuse. The jury of six will determine how much in damages Jones and Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, should pay relatives of five children and three adults killed at the school for saying the shooting didn’t happen and inflicting emotional distress. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also is a plaintiff.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man was killed when he was pinned beneath a truck, police said. Officers were called to Beehler Court in the Wilmington area Sunday for a report of a person hit by a vehicle, New Castle County Police said in a news release. When officers arrived, they found a 46-year-old man pinned beneath a Ford F-350 pickup truck, police said. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate the man, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and police said he was pronounced dead on the scene. The initial investigation revealed that the man got out of the truck while it was still in gear, and he was hit by the truck, then became pinned beneath it, police said. His body was turned over to the Delaware Division of Forensic Sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden paid tribute Friday to Jacqueline Kennedy, a predecessor 60 years ago, for her pivotal role in preventing the teardown of historic buildings on iconic Lafayette Square near the White House. Biden helped the White House Historical Association, an organization that Kennedy helped spearhead, unveil a medallion of the former first lady, designed by American artist Chas Fagan, in front of the association’s office on the square. The wife of President John F. Kennedy is widely credited with ushering in an emphasis on historic preservation at the White House during her 1,036 days as first lady. Lafayette Square, just north of the White House, over the years has become a gathering place for protesters, from suffragists in the early 20th century to Vietnam demonstrators in the 1960s to Americans speaking out for policing reform in 2020. In quieter daily times, it is a city oasis for tourists and for office workers on lunch breaks. The bas relief of Kennedy sits in a new garden at the front of the association’s office, known as Decatur House. It includes one of her best-known quotations: “The White House belongs to the American people.” Jill Biden said Kennedy worked to save the park and surrounding historic townhouses “because we all deserve to experience our rich history, the full, complex and beautiful story of who we are.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz began their rebuttal of the defense case Tuesday by showing the jury swastikas he drew on a gun magazine and his boots, his online racism and misogyny, and his online searches for child pornography. Prosecutors are trying to show that Cruz’s murder of 17 people at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School four years ago was driven by antisocial personality disorder – commonly known as being a sociopath – and not fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as the defense contends. Cruz, 24, pleaded guilty last October to the Feb. 14, 2018, murders – the trial is only to decide whether he is sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole. Detective Nick Masters, an online investigator, then testified about racist and sexist searches and comments Cruz made starting about eight months before the shootings. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer only allowed prosecutors to present a fraction of the searches and comments Cruz made, saying more would be excessively prejudicial. Jurors were told Cruz wrote that “the Nazi party will rise again.” He made searches and comments using a racial slur directed against Black people. He wrote that he punched his widowed mother and called her a slur used against women. He wrote that “women are less important than a dog.” He also made comments extolling animal abuse, saying he had killed 12 cats and writing: “I am glad when animals die. It makes me happy.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State regulators began hearings Tuesday on Georgia Power Co.’s request to raise rates by 12% over the next three years, setting up clashes over how much profit the utility should earn, how much solar panel owners should be paid and how rates should be structured. The five elected members of the Public Service Commission are scheduled to decide in December on the company’s request to collect a cumulative $2.8 billion more from its 2.3 million customers beginning in January. Changes are likely before any vote. The company says it needs more money to improve the grid, retire old coal plants, acquire electricity from new sources and upgrade customer-facing computer systems. A residential customer who uses 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month pays Georgia Power an average of $128 a month now, the company has said. Under the plan, that would rise by $14.32 a month in 2023, reaching a total of $16.29 more over the three-year period. That’s nearly $200 a year more by 2025. However, electricity bills are likely to go up even more. Commissioners have already approved plans for the company to increase rates by $3.78 a month when the first of two new nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle starts generating electricity, likely early next year. A bigger increase could follow the second new reactor coming online, possibly in 2024.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges he kidnapped and sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl and forced her to smoke meth. Duncan Mahi, 52, also requested a trial by jury. Judge Wendy M. DeWeese maintained bail for Mahi at $2 million and set his trial date for Feb. 7. According to an indictment filed Wednesday, Duncan forced the girl to tie up her boyfriend at a Anaehoomalu Beach in Waikoloa, put a knife to her throat and kidnapped her. He’s charged with 11 counts, including kidnapping, terroristic threatening, robbery, sexual assault and methamphetamine trafficking. If found guilty, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was convicted twice for two separate 2018 cases of terroristic threatening. Police issued an Maile Amber Alert, similar to the Amber Alert for missing children in other states, shortly after the girl’s kidnapping on Sept. 16. Police said the girl managed to get free one day later after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat, and people recognized her from the alert.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Universities across the state are warning staffers not to refer students to abortion providers, and at least one public university is barring employees from telling students how to obtain emergency contraception or birth control as well. It’s the latest restriction in a state that already holds some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. “This is going to have a very broad impact,” said Mike Satz, an attorney and former faculty member and interim dean at the University of Idaho’s College of Law. “It’s going to have a very strong chilling effect on free speech, and it’s going to scare people. I’m afraid it’s going to scare people from going to school here or sending their kids to school at Idaho institutions.” The prohibition against referring students to abortion providers or “promoting” abortion in any way comes from the “No Public Funds for Abortion Act,” passed by Idaho’s Republican-led Legislature in 2021. Boise State University, like the University of Idaho, told faculty members in a newsletter earlier this month that they could face felony charges for violating the law. Idaho State University did not respond to messages asking if it had issued similar guidance. The law also bars staffers and school-based health clinics from dispensing or telling students where to obtain emergency contraception, such as the Plan B pill, except for in cases of rape.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday that the state’s relatively low jobless rate will help him keep his promise to pay off coronavirus-era debt in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund by year’s end. The Democrat announced he will transfer $450 million from the account set aside to pay jobless benefits toward the debt that ballooned to $4.5 billion during business closures forced by COVID-19. That decreases the remaining balance of the federal loan to $1.8 billion, which Pritzker pledged will be eliminated by the new year. Illinois joined dozens of other states in borrowing money to pay unemployment claims, which in Illinois surged in spring 2020 to levels not seen since 1982. “With the COVID-19 pandemic came a disaster of a different kind,” Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “All across the United States, to make sure eligible individuals could get access to unemployment benefits, extraordinary measures were taken by state unemployment trust funds because nearly none … were funded enough to cover that kind of an emergency.” The General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, and Pritzker agreed last spring to use $2.7 billion in federal pandemic relief funds to more than halve the debt. Republicans argued for paying the entire balance with federal money while it was available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Satanic Temple is suing the state on claims a near-total abortion ban violates the rights of its Hoosier members who want abortions after their birth control failed. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by the Massachusetts-based religious association says it brought the lawsuit on behalf of anonymous women from Indiana who say they became pregnant by accident despite using contraceptives. Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are listed as defendants. The new law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks post-fertilization, when pregnancy poses a risk to the life or long-term health of the mother, or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Enforcement of the law was put on hold last week by a Monroe County judge who found that it may violate the Indiana Constitution. Rokita has already appealed the judge’s decision. The Satanic Temple has more than 11,300 members in Indiana, according to its lawsuit. The group “venerates, but does not worship,” the allegorical Satan as featured in the 17th-century epic poem “Paradise Lost” by John Milton. Members follow a set of tenets including the belief that a person’s body is subject to their will and their will alone, the lawsuit says, and that beliefs should “conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Cattle producer Bryan Sievers thinks the black-eyed Susans, purple coneflowers and native grasses in his eastern Iowa prairie can help warm homes and tackle water pollution, erosion and other pressing environmental problems in the state. Thanks to a five-year, $80 million federal grant, Sievers will work with Missouri business Roeslein Alternative Energy, Iowa State University and a dozen other groups to test whether U.S. farmers can make money turning prairies and manure into renewable fuel. Sievers and his partners plan to mix harvested prairie, cover crops and conservation grassland with cattle manure in an anaerobic digester to make renewable natural gas that will go into a pipeline that feeds homes and businesses or be compressed to power trucks and other vehicles. The project is one of 70 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently awarded $2.8 billion, a total the federal agency nearly tripled after receiving about 450 requests. The projects seek to create new carbon markets that pay farmers for work to reduce the environmental impact of commodities like corn, soybeans, beef and pork. Sievers and his partners expect their project will help pave the way for more on-farm digesters that can reduce odor from cattle, pig and other livestock operations; cut harmful methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; and encourage farmers to plant prairies, conservation reserve grasses and annual cover crops on marginal farmland, as well as buffers along rivers, lakes and streams.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison for his role in a hoax phone call that led police to shoot and kill an innocent man in 2017. Shane Gaskill was sentenced after pleading guilty in May to wire fraud, KSN reports. He was originally placed on probation but faced renewed prosecution after violating the terms of his probation. Prosecutors said Gaskill got into an argument in December 2017 with Ohio gamer Casey Viner over a $1.50 bet. Using an old Wichita address Gaskill had given him, Viner persuaded Tyler Barris in Los Angeles to call Wichita police and say a kidnapping and shooting had happened at the address, prosecutors said. It’s called “swatting,” a form of retaliation in which someone makes a false report to police to send first responders, including SWAT teams, to someone’s address. Andrew Finch, 28, who lived at the address, was shot and killed by police after he opened the front door to see what was going on outside. Barris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts of making fake emergency calls and threats around the country, including the one that led to Finch’s death. Viner served 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman who shoplifted about $80 worth of items from a Walmart self-checkout station should not face a felony that carries five to 10 years in prison – a punishment that Attorney General Daniel Cameron defended. All seven justices instead agreed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had said it was “inherently unfair to convict somebody of a class C felony for theft of goods worth $80,” and the high court sent the case back to Pulaski Circuit Court, where a jury had initially found Chasity Shirley guilty of “unlawful access to a computer.” Shirley, 34, will now likely receive a directed verdict, which would see her felony conviction dismissed in court. While shopping in 2018 at a Walmart in Somerset, Shirley pulled what retailers call a “switcheroo” by switching the bar codes from a toothbrush holder with those from a more expensive children’s rug and slipcover before checking herself out of the store. A loss-control associate caught her, and the cost difference between the item she paid for and the two items she tried to take was $80.80. She also allegedly “pushed and elbowed” a loss prevention manager as she exited the store but was later found not guilty of a fourth-degree assault charge at trial, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A social services nonprofit long called the Kingsley House renamed itself Tuesday, dropping the name of a Victorian clergyman who is perhaps best remembered as the author of a children’s fantasy novel but held profoundly racist views. For 126 years it was Kingsley House, named both for author and social reformer Charles Kingsley and for the founder’s son Kingsley Warner, who died as a toddler. Now the nonprofit will be called Clover. Officials knew Charles Kingsley had been a chaplain to Queen Victoria, tutor to the boy who became King George V, and had written about 20 books. “And he was quote-unquote a social reformer who helped create the settlement house movement,” said Keith Liederman, CEO of Clover, shortly before Tuesday’s announcement. The Rev. Beverly Warner of New Orleans’ Trinity Episcopal Church founded Kingsley House in 1896 as a settlement house, an inner-city institution dedicated to fighting poverty. The organization’s programs now help children in need, families and community. Its prominence made it a stop in Democrat John Edwards’ unsuccessful campaign for president in 2007. Its community outreach was why former Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush visited there in 2006 to announce $9.7 million in grants to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Congressional candidates in a hotly contested race snipped at each other Tuesday about a contribution from the leader of a conservation group that has discouraged consumers from buying lobster. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is defending his seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District against Republican former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and independent candidate Tiffany Bond. Poliquin’s campaign on Tuesday called on Golden to return a contribution of $667 from Julie Packard, the executive director of Seafood Watch. The group based at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that Packard helped found added American and Canadian lobster to its “red list” of seafood species to avoid this summer because of the risk fishing gear poses to endangered whales. Poliquin’s camp said that listing has caused economic hardship for fishermen in Maine, where most of the nation’s domestic lobster comes to the docks. “Seafood Watch’s warning to consumers to avoid Maine lobster, on top of forty-year high inflation and fuel prices, have gouged Maine lobstermen’s paychecks,” said Roy Matthews, a Poliquin spokesperson. Golden’s campaign said he has no intention to return the money and cited Golden’s opposition to new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whale protection regulations as evidence that he has the fishing industry’s interests at heart.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A judge granted an emergency petition Friday filed by the Maryland State Board of Elections to enable the counting of mail-in ballots earlier than they were during the state’s July primary. Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Bonifant granted the petition, which will allow local elections officials across the state to begin canvassing mail-in ballots on Oct. 1. Bonifant wrote that with so many mail-in ballots, local boards of election would not be able to verify the vote count within 10 days of the general election as required. “There is no doubt that the increased number of mail-in ballots will have an enormous affect on the process of this election,” Bonifant wrote in his ruling. “Mandatory deadlines will be missed if the Court takes no action.” The state elections board said the ruling provides election officials with additional time to canvass and tabulate mail-in ballots to ensure that all critical election-related deadlines established by law are met. “It also enables elections officials to return to a well-established process of canvassing mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, which was allowed in the 2020 General Election,” the board said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A Harwich pig that had long been overshadowed by a diva sibling has risen to celebrity status and beer label glory. A stirring portrait of Bartholomew, a 200-pound half-Julianna, half-mini pig, now graces the cans of a new offering from the Provincetown Brewing Co. The high hog honor has not affected Bart one bit. “He’s kind of like an old man in a sport coat with sneakers on,” owner Emma Bankman said. “He doesn’t care what anyone thinks.” “Bartholobrew,” billed as “a classic wheat ale with sweet, caramelly notes,” is the frothy result of a summer-long pet label contest to benefit Provincetown’s Carrie A. Seaman Animal Shelter. Sherry Brec, CASAS board president, said there were more than 65 animal entries, and the donate-to-vote system generated more than $17,000 for the no-kill facility that places dogs and cats with folks on the Outer Cape. Meanwhile, in Harwich, Bartholomew has finally eclipsed the renown of his domineering half-sister Matilda. According to Bankman, Matilda has long been the boss hog in the house and often shuts the door on Bart, leaving him outside. And Matilda even tried to nose in on Bart’s bowl of celebratory Bartholobrew, a sudsy incursion that was nipped in the bud by an alert Bankman.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: General Motors is stepping back a bit on a return-to-work policy after a backlash from salaried employees. CEO Mary Barra sent out a note to the salaried workforce Tuesday offering an apology of sorts for the timing of putting out a new policy late in the day Friday saying employees would have to return to working in the office three days a week. She said in the update that GM’s plan still will include a more regular in-person presence, but it will not implement any changes to its return-to-the-office policy this year as the company continues to listen to worker feedback. The plan still will ask employees to work in-office three days each week. “The initial letter was a notification, and the purpose of the update is to provide clarification and additional details,” GM spokeswoman Maria Raynal said Tuesday. “The timing has shifted slightly; however, the overall plan has not changed.” In Tuesday’s note sent to employees, Barra wrote: “We want to take the opportunity to address some of the questions, concerns, and misconceptions that we’ve heard. We acknowledge that the timing of the message, late on a Friday afternoon, was unfortunate. It was also unintentional.” GM will communicate more information on its plan next month, Barra said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republicans attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz on Monday after a judge took the rare step of disputing the administration’s claim that the judge prevented the state from cutting off payments to Feeding Our Future, which is the target of a $250 million federal fraud case. The GOP candidates for governor, attorney general and state auditor – Scott Jensen, Jim Schultz and Ryan Wilson – said Walz and other top Democrats should have done more to stop the alleged fraud before it became what federal prosecutors last week called the largest pandemic-related fraud in the country. But the warring political sides disagree on how far Ramsey County District Judge John Guthmann went toward compelling the Minnesota Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future. A court statement issued late Friday said the judge “never issued an order” for the state to resume payments, but the department produced a hearing transcript showing the judge threatened to hold one attorney in contempt if the state failed to restore the flow of funds. The Republican candidates largely accepted the judge’s version of events. Jensen called for an independent investigation to report back before he and Walz hold their next debate Oct. 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The federal government wants to work with officials in the city to reach a legal agreement that ensures Jackson can sustain its water system in the future, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said Monday. Federal attorneys also sent a letter to city officials Monday threatening legal action if Jackson does not agree to negotiations related to its water system. Regan returned to Mississippi’s capital city Monday to meet with Jackson officials about the city’s troubled water system. At the meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and U.S. Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim, Regan said the federal government would work with the city to “deliver long overdue relief for Jackson residents.” “The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades. After years of neglect, Jackson’s water system finally reached a breaking point this summer, leaving tens of thousands of people without any running water for weeks,” Regan said. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.” In a Monday letter sent to city officials and obtained by the news station WLBT-TV, Kim and attorneys for DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section said they were “prepared to file an action” against the city under the Safe Drinking Water Act but hoped the matter could be resolved through an “enforceable agreement.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: As abuse allegations mount against a Christian boarding school, the way “troubled” children are often whisked away to facilities far from home is under fire. Within what’s known as the secure transport industry, it’s called “gooning.” Brawny men show up under the cover of darkness and force a teenager into a vehicle, taking them against their will to a boarding school, foster home or treatment center. They might be restrained with handcuffs or zip ties. They could be blindfolded or hooded. Criminal charges are rare because the little-known industry is virtually unregulated. In Missouri alone, more than 100 Christian boarding schools promise hope for wayward teens. The former doctor at Agape Boarding School, in Stockton, which serves about 60 teenage boys, was charged last year with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children, and five staff members are charged with abuse. In nearby Humansville, Circle of Hope, a Christian boarding school for girls, closed amid an investigation in 2020. The husband-and-wife co-founders were charged with 99 abuse counts last year, including sexual abuse. The allegations of wrongdoing at Agape and Circle of Hope led state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Democrat, to sponsor a measure signed into law last year that requires more rigorous oversight in Missouri. Now, Ingle said she’ll seek stricter regulations on companies transporting the kids against their will.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities said Tuesday that they were investigating the shooting of a 6-month-old dog by a woman who skinned the animal and posted pictures of herself with the pelt, apparently believing she had killed a young wolf. The animal was among more than a dozen dogs that local residents reported abandoned last week on national forest land in northwestern Montana near Kalispell, according to the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office. The hunter who shot one of the dogs posted images of herself smiling on social media in front of the animal’s head and hide, which were taken by the sheriff’s office and turned over to a state wildlife biologist, said Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon. The biologist determined the remains belonged to a domestic dog about 6 months old, Lemon said. Officials were investigating if the woman was properly licensed to hunt wolves, he said. The sheriff’s office is investigating both the shooting of the dog and the abandonment of the other dogs but declined Tuesday to release any further information. Lemon said accurately identifying animals before they are shot is a core tenet of hunting. “The vast majority of hunters are very deliberate about when they pull the trigger that the animal in their sights is the animal they are licensed to hunt,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: With Memorial Stadium on the cusp of its 100th anniversary, the University of Nebraska athletic department on Thursday set the stage for a massive renovation that will make the venue more fan-friendly for decades to come. University leaders also announced a new multimedia rights deal that would bring in more than $300 million over 15 years and said that alcohol would be sold at men’s and women’s basketball games at Pinnacle Bank Arena starting this season. The athletic department must get approval from the university Board of Regents, which is expected to approve the plans. The next board meeting is Friday. Nebraska is scheduled to open a $160 million football facility next year, and the Big Ten’s billion-dollar-a-year media rights deal announced this summer will bring unprecedented windfalls to league members. The announcements came less than two weeks after Nebraska began its search for a new football coach following the firing of Scott Frost. Athletic director Trev Alberts said discussions about stadium upgrades and the rights deal have been going on for months, and the timing is coincidental. The Cornhuskers have played in Memorial Stadium since 1923, and incremental improvements have been made over the years, including luxury suites in 1999 and an expansion to more than 85,000 seats in 2013.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A dolphin habitat at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip has been temporarily closed after the third mammal death at the attraction in five months. Officials at the Mirage Secret Garden and Habitat said an 11-year-old bottlenose dolphin named K2 died Saturday. The cause of death remains unclear, but officials told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the mammal had been receiving treatment for a respiratory illness. They say Maverick, a 19-year-old bottlenose dolphin, died Sept. 2 following treatment for a lung infection, while 13-year-old Bella died in April after undergoing treatment for gastroenteritis. According to the international organization Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums’ website, a bottlenose dolphin’s life expectancy is about 28 to 29 years. Mirage interim President Franz Kallao said officials were working closely with veterinary and pathology experts to determine the cause of death for K2, who was born at the Secret Garden. “We are also working with additional outside veterinary, water quality, behavioral, animal welfare, and environmental experts to help us conduct a thorough review and inspection of both the animals and the facility,” Kallao said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: A local woman who found herself with an unexpected inheritance and the desire to “do the most good” with the money is helping to make housing for domestic abuse survivors possible. She received more than half a million dollars following the sale of real estate her late uncle’s family business owned. Knowing her family was financially comfortable and living within their means, she did something unexpected: She became an angel investor with a $500,000 investment into Dover Housing Authority-owned property. This income assures the future of the Haven at the Falls project to house domestic abuse survivors, said Ryan Crosby, executive director of the authority. The investment will serve as seed funding to build the affordable housing units. The proposed six-unit apartment development is planned in the Dover Housing Authority’s Whittier Falls neighborhood. The new project was born out of a partnership between the Dover Housing Authority and Haven, a domestic and sexual violence prevention agency. “Our angel investor is a lot like me – frustrated with how little affordable housing there is and how little there is we can do about it,” Crosby said. “This investment allows us to both make a direct, measurable impact in that fight. We both share the belief that housing is a human right.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After months of calls to eliminate a state-mandated expensive teacher licensing test blamed for worsening the teacher shortage, Gov. Phil Murphy did away with it – sort of. The Murphy administration said the educative Teacher Performance Assessment would no longer be required in New Jersey, but it must be replaced by a similar test to be used to certify graduates. Murphy issued a conditional veto Thursday to legislation that shifts the burden of certifying teachers from the state’s shoulders to the colleges that train them. Starting in spring 2024, colleges and universities will be required to use their own tests as a final step to certify graduates before they may join the workforce. The conditional veto was welcomed by many of the state’s education-related groups, including the state superintendents’ association, teachers’ unions and school principals’ associations. Some said Murphy waited too long to make a decision about the test. The New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, welcomed the move to remove the edTPA but indicated in its statement that the decision could have come earlier and that it continues to delay teacher candidates who are otherwise ready to start working.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are reconsidering how they evaluate complaints of sexual misconduct against colleagues, amid outrage about the handling of a complaint against an influential senator. A panel of leading lawmakers met Monday to discuss possible changes to ground rules for harassment investigations at the Legislature. “It has become clear that our anti-harassment policy is not working,” said Democratic state Rep. Daymon Ely of Corrales, co-chairman of a legislative ethics committee. “This is intended to start a discussion.” Harassment complaints against lawmakers are often assigned for an initial investigation to a panel of four legislators, which may deadlock on a 2-2 vote. Ely proposed the changes that would assign an outside expert to break any tie vote, with public notice of the outcome. Ely outlined proposals that would remove secrecy provisions that currently prevent people who complain of harassment by legislators from publicly discussing any investigation that has been dismissed without a finding of probable cause. “How do we fix that so that we have closure for those people?” said Democratic Sen. George Muñoz, of Gallup. “It can’t come out in a tie. There has to be closure for both sides.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State investigators have substantiated more than 1,600 instances of corporal punishment in New York schools over the past five years, The Times Union in Albany reports. A substantial number of the complaints were in New York City public schools, according to the newspaper. Other incidents included a substitute teacher in Watertown who was fired and arrested for grabbing a student by the throat and forcing him against a wall and a teaching assistant in Syracuse who was transferred and retrained for spanking a nonverbal student. Corporal punishment is generally banned and can be classified as child abuse. In all, the state Education Department documented nearly 18,000 complaints of corporal punishment in public and charter schools from 2016 through 2021, according to the Times Union. The newspaper said it found that school districts have underreported cases of corporal punishment to the federal government and that state Education Department records are not readily available to the public.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Four people pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanors for their roles in absentee ballot fraud in rural North Carolina during the 2016 and 2018 elections. The convictions stemmed from an investigation that in part resulted in a do-over congressional election. Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway accepted the plea agreements, which resulted in no active prison or jail time, in Wake County court. Cases against six other defendants remained pending, with hearings scheduled through the end of next month, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said. All 10 defendants, according to indictments handed up in 2019, had a common involvement with Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., a longtime political operative in rural Bladen County. Dowless also was indicted on more than a dozen state charges, with his case scheduled last year to go to trial last month. He rejected a plea agreement and looked forward to his day in court, according to a friend. But he died in April after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Freeman said at the time that the prosecution of the other cases would continue. Dowless worked in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris, who appeared to have received the most votes in the general election for the 9th District seat in south-central North Carolina. But allegations against Dowless surfaced, and testimony and other information revealed at a State Board of Elections hearing described him running an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A prison guard was fired over the suicide of a man who was serving life sentences for killing four people. Sgt. Deandre Adams violated corrections policy in failing to adequately check on Chad Isaak, according to a termination letter from the warden at North Dakota State Penitentiary. Adams was fired Thursday. Warden James Sayler noted that Adams had received two previous written reprimands, for failing to report that he had left a missing inmate in a recreational area and for not intervening when two prisoners were potentially exchanging contraband, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Your credibility, professionalism, and the trust I had in you as a sergeant are irreparably damaged,” Sayler wrote. “This level of trust, which is expected of every team member, is something I no longer have in you, due to your misconduct.” Isaak, 48, died July 31. An investigative report from the state Highway Patrol released last month found that Adams said he failed to adequately check on Isaak twice. It also said Isaak had covered his cell with cardboard. Adams knew inmates were not allowed to cover their cell windows but allowed it as a “courtesy in case they were naked in their cells,” the report said. “He stated they could enforce it but that they would just get more window coverings.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has officially signed off on its biggest package of incentives tied to job creation – potentially totaling as much as $650 million over 30 years for Intel for its $20 billion investment in Licking County. The Ohio Tax Credit Authority on Monday approved the incentive package, one of six projects the panel approved. As is the case with most projects that come before the authority, there was little discussion about the Intel project before the four members approved it. The $650 million approved Monday is part of a total incentive package from Ohio to Intel that is expected to top $2 billion. Unlike the other state incentives for Intel, the one approved by the authority is based on how many jobs it creates. The incentive begins in 2024; Intel has said in anticipates production of semiconductors to begin in 2025. Intel announced in January its plan to create 3,000 jobs as part of its $20 billion investment in New Albany, the biggest single economic development project in state history. Those jobs will have an annual payroll of $405 million, according to Intel. Intel has said it expects to start recruiting this fall from college campus as it anticipates ramping up hiring in advance of the opening of the two plants.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 Tuesday to deny clemency for a man sentenced to die for killing his 9-month-old daughter in 2002, moving him a step closer to his scheduled lethal injection next month. Attorneys for Benjamin Cole, 57, did not dispute that Cole killed Brianna Cole by forcibly bending the infant backward, breaking her spine and tearing her aorta, but they argued that he both is severely mentally ill and has a growing lesion on his brain that has continued to worsen while he has been in prison. Cole has refused medical attention and ignored his personal hygiene, hoarding food and living in a darkened cell with little to no communication with staff or fellow prisoners, his attorneys told the panel. “His condition has continued to decline over the course of this year,” Cole’s attorney Katrina Conrad-Legler said. The lesion on Cole’s brain, which is separate from his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has grown in size in recent years and affects the part of his brain that deals with problem-solving, movement and social interaction, Conrad-Legler said. Cole declined to speak to the panel. Attorneys for the state and members of the victim’s family told the board that Cole’s symptoms of mental illness are exaggerated and that the brutal nature of his daughter’s killing merits his execution.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two ships that have been abandoned in the Columbia River for years are being removed, and the U.S. Coast Guard is working with state agencies to clean up the fuel and oil that leaked from the vessels. The ships – a Navy tug called the Sakarissa and a Coast Guard cutter called the Alert – first arrived in Portland in 2006 and were brought near Hayden Island in hopes that they could be turned into a museum. But the funding for that project dried up, and they have been abandoned for more than a decade.Both of the ships sunk two years ago. Bill Ryan with the Oregon Department of State Lands said it’s not yet clear why the Alert sunk, but the Sakarissa foundered after someone salvaging metal cut through a pipe, causing it to flood. The Coast Guard raised the 100-foot Sakarissa from the river last week and towed it to a repair service to remove the remaining oil waste from the ship. Metro Council, a regional government agency that serves three counties in northwest Oregon, is spending $2 million to have the ships removed, and the Coast Guard is spending more than $1 million to clean up. The state estimates that there are more than 300 vessels abandoned around Oregon. Removing them all would cost an estimated $40 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney signed an executive order Tuesday banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. The order is the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits – something made difficult by Pennsylvania’s preemption law that bars municipalities from enacting or enforcing their own stricter gun regulations. Attorneys for the city said the executive order is the city managing its facilities as a property owner, making it different from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. The ceremonial signing also comes the day after Kenney spoke at the funeral for Tiffany Fletcher, a 41-year-old mother of three, who was struck and killed by crossfire earlier this month outside of the city recreation center where she worked. A 14-year-old, who was firing at another group of teens, has since been charged in Fletcher’s shooting death. “I watched (parks and recreation workers) yesterday line up on Lehigh Avenue like police officers burying one of their own. … I saw what I usually see when a police officer or firefighter dies in the line of duty. They were all out there lined up like they were on the front line, and they are,” Kenney said, fighting back his emotions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBarrington: The owner of the historic Belton Court mansion has applied to demolish the deteriorating buildings on the 37-acre property. While the demolition permit has not been granted, there is little Barrington can do to prevent issuing the demolition permit once all the requirements are met, including such items as a plan to dispose of asbestos. Barrington Town Manager Phil Hervey said the mansion, once occupied by the Zion Bible College, was the centerpiece of the town’s 2016 master plan, as well as zoning rules passed specifically for the property that would allow it to become age-restricted housing. He is trying to set up a meeting with the project’s managers to discuss the demolition, but no date has been set. “We cannot prevent the teardown,” Hervey said. “If it meets the technical requirements, I don’t see any way to not issue it at a certain point.” The property has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. It was once an 800-acre estate, the country house of Frederick Peck, designed by the Providence architecture firm Martin & Hall. The property is owned by a Chinese investor and holdings company who bought it atpublic auction in 2011 for $3.85 million after town officials backed out of a plan to purchase it from the Zion Bible Institute for $5.2 million. Barrington College occupied the campus in the 1950s until it was bought in 1985 by the Zion Bible Institute, which vacated the property in 2007.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservative lawmakers voted Tuesday not to make changes to the state’s abortion laws after this summer’s U.S. Supreme Court decision, meaning rules on abortion likely will not become more restrictive. South Carolina was for decades at the forefront of passing more restrictive abortion laws that challenged Roe v. Wade, before the landmark case was overturned this summer. But the state that helped lead the nation through requiring ultrasounds, parental consent and 24-hour waiting periods before abortions is at an impasse during a special session. The Senate could only muster enough votes to tweak South Carolina’s current six-week ban – which isn’t even in effect at the moment because of a state Supreme Court challenge. The House started its session Tuesday by rejecting a proposal by Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter to have the right to abortion placed before voters in a constitutional amendment. “Why are you afraid to let the people decide?” Cobb-Hunter asked. “Are you afraid you are going to be proven wrong? I think that’s it.” The rejection of the Senate’s version allows a group of three lawmakers from each chamber to work on a compromise between the Senate bill and the House version, which banned almost all abortions with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or that threaten the life of the mother up to 12 weeks after conception.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: For the first time this year, anthrax, a serious bacterial disease, has been found in a herd of livestock in western South Dakota. State Veterinarian Dr. Beth Thompson confirmed the presence of the disease in a press release from the South Dakota Animal Industry Board on Tuesday. The disease was found in several deceased cows that belonged to a herd of 160 unvaccinated cattle in Meade County. South Dakota State University’s animal disease laboratory confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend. Anthrax is a pervasive disease that can devastate herds of livestock in a short amount of time, “and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak,” Thompson said in the release. Cattle that catch anthrax may sudden perish without any visible symptoms. Russ Daly, state public health veterinarian with SDSU, said the general public is not at risk of infection, but farmers need to avoid making direct skin contact with carcasses containing anthrax. Drought, floods and winds can spread anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Spores can also persist indefinitely in contaminated soil and may vegetate in grazeland, which could further spread the infection among South Dakota’s cattle.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s textbook commission may need additional staff and its own attorney to deal with the aftermath of a new, controversial Tennessee law requiring schools to catalog and publicize a list of all available library and classroom materials. Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission chair Linda Cash told a legislative subcommittee on Tuesday the law has added a lot of work “to people who already have a full load.” Cash suggested the commission should have an independent attorney who can answer commission questions, as the commission is currently seeking legal answers from the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office. “The way that we’re designed currently, it’s hard to get an opinion,” Cash said. The commission faces a Dec. 1 deadline to issue statewide guidance on the library materials law, which the General Assembly passed this year in response to pushback from conservatives alleging students were being exposed to “inappropriate” school materials. The commission must provide schools’ guidance on determining what is age-appropriate, which is not settled in state law, in addition to establishing an appeals process for local decisions on contested materials.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ran out of his house and jumped into a truck driven by his wife, a state senator, to avoid being served a subpoena to testify Tuesday in an abortion access case, according to court documents. A process server wrote in an affidavit that he was attempting to deliver the federal court subpoena Monday at Paxton’s home and ultimately had to leave the document on the ground. He said the Republican avoided him for more than an hour from inside his house, then dashed toward the truck, and the couple drove off. Paxton, who is facing a variety of legal troubles as he seeks to win a third term in November, said he avoided the server out of safety concerns and said the news media should be ashamed for reporting on what happened. “It’s clear that the media wants to drum up another controversy involving my work as Attorney General, so they’re attacking me for having the audacity to avoid a stranger lingering outside my home and showing concern about the safety and well-being of my family,” Paxton wrote on Twitter on Monday night. On Tuesday, a judge hearing the lawsuit by nonprofit groups that want to help Texans pay for abortions out of state granted Paxton’s request to quash the subpoena.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: State wildlife officers are launching a new drone team to help prevent vandalism and provide law enforcement on public lands. Five Division of Wildlife Resources officers completed various licensing and training requirements with the Federal Aviation Administration to become certified law enforcement drone operators and staff the first Unmanned Aerial Systems team. “Using drones will help us more effectively solve wildlife crimes, and having trained law enforcement drone pilots will also allow us to assist other law enforcement agencies with search-and-rescue efforts or any other investigations,” DWR Captain Wade Hovinga said. The specialized drone officers function similarly to a K-9 officer team, called in to help with situations like search-and-rescue operations, searching for evidence of illegally taken wildlife, assisting biologists with wildlife surveys and investigating hunting-related shooting incidents. “Utah conservation officers are public servants, and these new tools will help us better serve the public, whether we’re solving poaching crimes or locating lost hunters,” Hovinga said. DWR officers patrol Utah’s mountains, lakes and unpopulated areas, often on foot or on off-road vehicles or even on horseback, investigating wildlife-related violations.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: A student at a military college who sued top Pentagon officials after he was deemed unfit for service because he tested positive for HIV has settled his lawsuit and plans to pursue his dream of becoming an Army officer, his lawyers said Tuesday. “I am incredibly grateful to be back on track to obtain a contract with the ROTC and then commission as an officer,” Eddie Diaz, a student at Norwich University, said in a statement released by Lawyers for Civil Rights. “I just want an opportunity to serve my country, and I believe that should be available to all eligible Americans.” The plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Burlington in May was listed as John Doe, but Diaz is now using his real name publicly. Diaz, 21, of Revere, Massachusetts, said in the complaint that he tested positive for HIV in October 2020 during his sophomore year at Norwich, the nation’s oldest private military college. He was deemed unfit for service and dropped from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and the Vermont National Guard in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law despite being “healthy, asymptomatic and on a treatment regimen that renders his viral load undetectable,” according to the suit. Military officials never asked him how he manages his HIV or spoke to his treating physician, and he was never examined by a military doctor, the suit said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society is creating a database with the information it has uncovered about enslaved people in the area so descendants can make connections. The goal is to allow descendants’ voices to guide the process for creating some kind of memorial for the site, The Daily Progress reports. Charlottesville native Diane Brown Townes knew some of her family history from records kept in an old tattered family Bible passed down for generations, and she knew she had ancestors who were enslaved in the region. But until recently, she had no idea some of her people may be buried in unmarked graves in a city park she’d spent lots of time in over the years or that she’s been living next door to relatives without knowing it. The Charlottesville officials believe there are at least 43 enslaved people buried at Pen Park in unmarked graves. The graves are adjacent to a cemetery belonging to the Gilmer family, which owned a tobacco plantation on the land where the city-owned park and golf course are today. The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society started researching the probable identities of the people buried in the park last year. Members have been able to identify and connect with several area residents likely to have ancestors buried in the park. “For me, it’s finally being able to understand your feeling, a sense of being. I really never felt connected to history. I was always taught dates from a more white, patriarchal perspective,” Townes said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Navy have started efforts to recover the wreckage of a floatplane that crashed in the Puget Sound earlier this month, killing all 10 people on board. A barge that’s been equipped to conduct the recovery entered the shipping channel Monday, KING-5 News reports. It was expected to drop anchors near the suspected wreckage location before a team arrived at the barge Tuesday. The U.S. Navy will use a remotely operated vehicle Deep Drone 8,000, a barge and a crane in recovery efforts. The remotely operated vehicle will collect smaller pieces of wreckage into baskets for the crane to lift, the NTSB said. Some items from the plane have already been recovered, including foam fragments, a seat cushion, a seat belt, dispatch paperwork, flooring structure remnants and some personal items belonging to the victims, according to the NTSB. The plane was traveling from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island to the Seattle suburb of Renton when it crashed Sept. 4. Only one body was found, identified as Gabby Hanna, of Seattle. Officials say determining the probable cause of the crash could take 12 to 24 months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A protester who was forcefully removed from the House of Delegates gallery after allegedly disrupting debate on a bill to ban abortion earlier this month was arrested more than a week after she and others rallied against the ban at the state Capitol. Lindsey Jacobs, a 38-year-old lawyer from Morgantown, was arrested Friday and charged with three misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, willful disruption of governmental processes, and disorderly conduct against “the peace and dignity of the state,” according to a copy of the arrest warrant. Jacobs, who runs advocacy programs for a nonprofit legal services organization, was removed from the House chamber’s gallery Sept. 13 while listening to lawmakers discuss legislation that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with few exceptions. Republican Del. Margitta Mazzocchi said people who want to protect against pregnancy can buy emergency contraceptives – known as “Plan B” pills – over the counter. “Not if you’re poor,” Jacobs shouted down at lawmakers, followed by shouts from others sitting in the gallery. Jacobs said she became frustrated listening to Mazzocchi’s speech because she felt like the lawmaker was overlooking that the pills cost between $40 and $50, an amount she said is “cost-prohibitive for a lot of people.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All records from the closed Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in the state are being uploaded to a website “for all to see,” an attorney told a judge Tuesday. The investigation was led by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who was fired in August by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. He fired Gableman just days after Vos won his primary over an opponent whom Gableman and ex-President Donald Trump endorsed. But the office Gableman led still exists after he was fired. American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, has filed four open records lawsuits against Gableman, Vos and the office seeking records created during the investigation. On Tuesday, during a hearing over a lawsuit American Oversight filed seeking to stop the deletion of records, attorney James Bopp said that all electronic and paper records from the office have been turned over to the Assembly chief clerk’s office. The files are being uploaded to a website that will soon be available “for all to see,” said Bopp, who represents the office, which he said has no employees. Hundreds of pages of documents have already been made public as the result of other American Oversight lawsuits. Bopp said the data yet-to-be made public that’s being processed now includes text messages on cellphones used in the course of the investigation.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon plans to propose spending $25 million in federal pandemic relief on affordable housing projects, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The governor’s office plans to submit its proposal to a legislative committee for a grant program aimed at funding “shovel-ready” projects with the American Rescue Plan Act money, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}]}

Songsmith Drive in Bear, may start selling tickets by the end of July, Weir told The News Journal/Delaware Online.\n\nWhile drive-in movie-style pop ups have been trending in Delaware and elsewhere during the pandemic, Weir would love to see his project become the state's only permanent drive-in theater.\n\nThe twin-screen drive-in theater, he said, will be the first ever in Bear. The venue will feature first-run movies.\n\n“If it’s new, more than likely we’ll show it,” said Weir, formerly of Stanton, who relocated to Fair Hill, Maryland, last year.\n\nMore:What would summer be without Old Pro and other mini golf spots in Delaware, Ocean City?\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matthew Meyer is already revved up for the new business.\n\n“[In] the immortal words of Clint Eastwood’s ‘Dirty Harry,’ this news ‘made my day,’ '' Meyer said. “Loosely paraphrasing another iconic movie line, I have no question that ‘When they build it, we will come.’ ”\n\nA kernel of inspiration\n\nThe motivation for the Bear Drive-In started from a kernel of an idea last fall when The Grand in Wilmington, where Weir works his day job, introduced their \"Drive-In Cinema'' series at Bellevue State Park, featuring a theme of movie musicals.\n\nThe series left such an impression on Weir, the technical director for The Grand, that he decided to see if he could recreate that magic in the parking lot of the old Avon factory in Newark.\n\nAfter reaching out to Reybold Venture Group, owners of the Avon factory, Reybold instead offered him an opportunity to use their property behind Lowe’s, which sits on about five or six acres, Weir said.\n\nThe Delaware native is in the process of building his twin movie screens from cargo shipping containers that will showcase films that come from digital movie projectors.\n\nWeir is taking an unconventional route by assembling his screens from containers because “it's quick and easy, it's affordable and convenient.”\n\nDelaware's drive-in history in reverse\n\nIt's been a dozen years since Delaware's drive-in movie era came to a close when Felton's Diamond State Drive-In on Route 13 showed its final double feature, \"Bolt\" and \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa.\"\n\nBy that time, the theater was an oddity, the last one standing after running from 1949 to 1986 before starting up again in 1995 for a final 13 year run.\n\nFlash-forward to 2020 — an age of high-back recliners in multiplexes with IMAX screens and unlimited comfort in home theaters — and everyone thought drive-ins were not only gone, but they were gone for good.\n\nThen a global pandemic hit.\n\nIn addition to The Grand, which returned by popular demand with its “Drive-In Cinema” in the spring, other drive-in experiences that got revved up in the First State during the pandemic included showings last summer of the original 1996 version of “Space Jam,” at the Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington; plus a showing of Sylvester Stallone’s classic “Rocky” at Lefty's Alley & Eats in Lewes.\n\nOver the last year, drive-in theaters around the country popped up in a welcomed revival.

Si Woo Kim, the tournament’s defending champion, also will be in the field, along with 2021 PGA Tour winner and Ryder Cup player Tony Finau. Finau has played in the tournament that last two years. Ryder Cup teammate Scott Scheffler also has committed early to the event.\n\n\"We've got a lot of great things in store as we welcome back our traditional three-day pro-am along with spectators to enjoy the event,\" tournament executive director Pat McCabe said. \"With that, health and safety will be a top priority for all of us.\"\n\nSpectators will be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter any of the golf courses used in the tournament.\n\nBesides the return of galleries, the tournament also will see the participation of 156 amateurs playing the first three days beside the pros in a 54-hole pro-am. Officials thought the pro-am could be played in 2021 under county and state safety protocols, but they believed it was not a good situation to bring the 156 amateurs and their caddies to the desert in a pandemic. It was the first time in the tournament’s 62-year history that amateurs did not play in the event with the tour pros.\n\nLa Quinta Country Club also was dropped from the 2021 tournament as officials decided to operate out of just the PGA West clubhouse while playing the Stadium and Nicklaus Tournament courses. La Quinta is back in the rotation this year alongside the two PGA West courses.\n\nThe tournament’s concert series also was a casualty of the pandemic last January, but the music will return after Friday and Saturday’s rounds next month. Pop/rock group Maroon 5 will perform after play Friday, with country star Brad Paisley playing on Saturday on the PGA West driving range.\n\nFinau, joining the news conference by phone from Las Vegas, said he's excited for a chance to again play in The America Express, where he finished fourth last year at the start of a strong year that saw him in contention in so many tournaments from January through December.\n\n\"Having guys like Maroon 5 there, concerts, I love music,\" Finau said. \"A tournament is a lot of things that go into a golf tournament, and what makes it special is kind of what happens during the week. To have concerts like that, to meet the great people in the pro-am, it has a field that's different than most of the other events we have, so I get to meet people that I admire and maybe looked up to in music or the entertainment industry. I have those opportunities during this event.

Former mall space is increasing being turned into mixed-use space with housing, entertainment and retail.\n\nThe Macy's moved out of Neshaminy in 2017, and the parcel was sold off by the mall the next year, but has sat bordered up and undeveloped since.\n\nMacy's no moreNeshaminy Mall’s closed Macy’s is sold\n\n\"It's gonna give it a big shot in the arm\" Chowdhury said of his plan for the over 200,000-square-foot former at the mall, which like so many other aging mega-retail centers, has fallen on hard times.\n\nThe developer plans a gym with outdoor space, a 9-hole golf course, 20 pickle ball courts, Vegas-style swimming pool and restaurant, among other features. Fusion is a unique combination of traditional weightlifting fitness center with luxury appointments that he said is a “lifter’s paradise.”\n\nChowdhury, 34, said he is finalizing the lease, and eventually will purchase the vacant department store.\n\nThe economics are on Chowdhury's side, he said.\n\nWith online shopping making it largely unnecessary for consumers to make purchases at legacy brick and mortar chain stores like Macy's, big box spaces are available cheap to be repurposed by enterprising self-starters.\n\n\"I believe if you can find problems in the world, and you can create a solution, you can make a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nBig box retail stores sit empty, and landlords are eager to make a deal. That's what happened with Choudhury's gym at 179 Lincoln Highway in Fairless Hills, the site of another shuttered retailer, Mealey's Furniture Outlet.\n\n\"The reason we chose (the Fairless Hills) location is because it was big enough (75,000 square feet), no one wanted it, we were able to get it dirt cheap, and we had enough runway to be able to raise the capital because we have almost two years of free rent to sell investors,\" he said.\n\nChowdhury said the paperwork for the lease and eventual purchase of the Macy's property from SANT Properties of Huntington Valley, which purchased the building in 2020, is almost complete.. A call to SANT was not immediately returned on Monday.\n\nBensalem Mayor Joseph DiGirolamo said he's impressed with how Choudhury has recreated the ordinary gym experience.\n\n\"He has a barber shop in it,\" he said. \"It could be the spark that the mall needs.\"\n\nChowdhury said he wants Fusion to be high-end, but affordable. A monthly membership to his Fairless Hill shop is $69, with no initiation fees or contract.\n\nHe said the Macy's location will open within nine months to a year.\n\nJD Mullane can be reached at 215-949-5745 or at jmullane@couriertimes.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2015/06/04/vw-volkswagen-golf-electric-review-ev-egolf/28322657/", "title": "Review: Electric 2015 Volkswagen e-Golf", "text": "Mark Phelan\n\nDetroit Free Press Auto Critic\n\nEPA%3A 83-mile range on a charge\n\nPrices start at %2433%2C450\n\nPoor audio for hands free phone calls\n\nThe ★★★ 2015 Volkswagen e-Golf is a stealth electric car, an alternate-energy wolf in the sheep's clothing of an unassuming compact hatchback.\n\nDespite boasting near-silent operation, a useful range of 83 miles on a charge, the e-Golf rolls alon virtually unnoticed thanks to exterior styling that does little to telegraph its advanced powertrain.\n\nThe e-Golf competes with other compact and smaller electric cars like the BMW i3, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Nissan Leaf, and electric versions of the Chevrolet Spark Fiat 500, Ford Focus, Kia Soul EV and Mercedes B-class. The Honda Fit EV would be a competitor, but Honda has not introduced an electric version of the new Fit that went on sale last year.\n\nExtended-range electric cars like the BMWi 3 extended, Cadillac ELR and Chevrolet Volt don't compete directly with those cars because their on-board generators give them much longer ranges.\n\nIn the auto industry, cars like the e-Golf, which have big batteries but lack the ability to make more electricity, are often called BEVs, for battery-electric vehicles.\n\nUnlike the spacey looking i3, most BEVs look a lot like the conventional car they're based on. The e-Golf makes very successful use of VW's new compact car architecture, offering ride, handling and accommodations that are nearly indistinguishable from the conventional Golf.\n\nPrices for the e-Golf start at $33,450. The base model is quite well equipped, coming with navigation, Bluetooth audio and phone compatibility, voice recognition, a backup camera and heated front seats. I tested an SEL Premium model that added features including cruise control, LED headlights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch wheels and faux leather upholstery. It stickered at $35,445. All prices exclude destination charges.\n\nThe e-Golf's price is at the high end among its most direct competitors, cars like the Focus, Leaf and Soul. EVs like the Spark, 500 and i-MiEV are so much smaller than the Golf that they're competitors only in the sense that they all run on battery power.\n\nLike most BEVs, the e-Golf has an electric motor and a single-speed transmission. The motor generates 115 hp and 199 pound-feet of torque. The torque is available from a standstill, delivering the smooth, confident acceleration that's a hallmark of electric vehicles.\n\nThe EPA rated the e-Golf's range on a charge at 83 miles. That's roughly in the middle of its class, beating the Focus, trailing the Leaf and Soul and effectively tying most of the others. It takes about four hours to fully charge the e-Golf with a 240v outlet. It would take about 20 hours to charge the car fully from a standard 120v outlet, but anybody who's considering an electric car should also plan on having a 240v charger installed.\n\nDriving the e-Golf feels a lot like driving a conventional car. The controls are all the same. The electric motor's power is sufficient for everyday driving. The car's top speed is electronically limited to 87 m.p.h. in its default normal operating mode. The driver can select Eco or Eco+ modes to increase the car's range somewhat.\n\nThe Golf's steering is responsive. The car's comfortable ride and good handling are consistent with conventionally powered Golfs, even though the 701-pound battery means those cars are 368 pounds lighter.\n\nThe e-Golf's interior is roomy, practical and comfortable. Attractive, padded materials cover most surfaces, with the exception of some subtle pieces of trim. The seats are covered in VW's V-Tex fake leather, which looks and feels fine. The controls are simple and easy to use, with a combination of conventional dials and buttons, voice recognition and a touch screen. It all works well, although the spoken commands for some tasks — setting a destination for the nav, for instance — require more steps than the best competitors.\n\nThe sound quality of hands-free phone calls was consistently poor. Everyone I called complained about it. Road and wind noise were very noticeable. Like other Golfs, the car does not have a USB port.\n\nThe passenger compartment is only slightly smaller than the base Golf, and the luggage compartment is slightly larger, according to EPA figures. Both are very accommodating. The seats are comfortable, and the Golf's practical exterior design — high roof and plenty of glass — provides good visibility.\n\nSharing many of the virtues that make the base Golf one of the world's best-selling cars, the e-Golf is a worthwhile addition to the growing fleet of electric vehicles.\n\nContact Mark Phelan: mmphelan@freepress.com or 313-222-6731.

Sign up here.\n\nBut June 16 has more than its share of coincidences.\n\nOakland Hills Country Club outside Detroit has hosted the U.S. Open on six different occasions. Three of those times, the tournament ended on June 16.\n\nIn 1951, Ben Hogan called it \"the greatest test of golf I have ever played and the toughest course\" when he shot a final-round 67 (one of only two sub-par rounds in the entire tournament) to Clayton Heafner by two shots.\n\nIn 1985, Andy North won his second U.S. Open title with a one-shot victory over Dave Barr, TC Chen and Denis Watson.\n\nAnd in 1996, Steve Jones won his only major, besting Tom Lehman and Davis Love III by a stroke.\n\n(Incidentally, Oak Hill Country Club in suburban Rochester, N.Y., has hosted the U.S. Open three times -- and twice had the final round on June 16 -- with Cary Middlecoff winning in 1956 and Lee Trevino taking the title in 1968.)\n\nJust for fun, here are the five best golfers to never win a U.S. Open title:\n\n5.

But, for the second year in a row, GoPro put this trust in the hands of its community.\n\n\"I mounted the camera to the front of my (snowboarding) helmet so that the angle could capture the front of my board and what was ahead of me,\" Gryczan said. \"Once I edited the video and sent it in, I just sat back and waited, knowing I had done everything I could.\n\n\"The day the winners were revealed, I crossed my fingers, but didn't get my hopes up too high before the 9 a.m. release time.\"\n\nGryczan was at work at his Plymouth office when an avalanche of congratulatory emails started flooding his inbox and happy emoji-themed messages lit up his cell phone.\n\n\"I thought it was kind of cool that mine was the only snowboarding highlight on the video,\" Gryczan said.\n\nDid the judges select the best clip of his entry to put into the final product?\n\n\"I feel they did,\" said Gryczan. \"In fact, I can remember the run (down the hill) like it was yesterday, and the part they chose was when I was going down a lot of fresh snow with some tight trees on either side of me. I think it kind of nails what they were trying to get out of the contest.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Gryczan said he plans to invest at least a portion of his winnings into more videotaping equipment.\n\nHooked on video\n\nIn addition to using GoPro, the Grandville native enjoys producing captivating videos with a drone he uses during vacations and work-related trips.\n\n\"For instance, when I was in San Francisco, I got some pretty cool footage of the Golden Gate Bridge,\" he said. \"And I put together a video that I put together from the drone footage of Belle Isle.\"\n\nGryczan's IndyCar focus is on making the Chevrolet-sponsored cars run as fast as possible. He travels to all of the IndyCar events and actually assists in calibrating the engines during the races.\n\n\"I love my job,\" he said. \"When I invite my friends and family to the races, I try to make sure they experience some of the glamorous side of the sport.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Gryczan revealed, he doesn't get to sit in the cockpit of the cars he works on — at least while they're moving.\n\n\"When I attended Michigan State, I was in a program in which we got to operate these mini-race cars that got up to about 80 or 90 (miles per hour),\" he said. \"After doing that, I can only imagine what it would be like to drive one going over 200.\"\n\nContact reporter Ed Wright at eawright@hometownlife.com or 517-375-1113.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/06/04/pryors-new-born-raised-fest-announces-post-pandemic-lineup/7553836002/", "title": "Pryor's new Born & Raised fest announces post-pandemic lineup ...", "text": "PRYOR — The Born & Raised Music Festival, a new outlaw, Texas and Red Dirt country music and camping event in Pryor, has announced the lineup and details for its 2021 inaugural experience.\n\nThe fall fest will feature more than 30 acts, including headlining sets from ZZ Top and Cody Jinks, plus performances from Blackberry Smoke, Lucinda Williams, Randy Rogers Band, Parker McCollum, Robert Earl Keen, Pat Green, Jack Ingram and more.\n\nThe event is set for Sept. 18-19 with a special pre-festival Honky Tonk Friday Sept. 17 at the Pryor Creek Music Festival Grounds, the long-standing home of Rocklahoma.\n\nThe inaugural Born & Raised Music Festival was initially scheduled for June 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore:deadCenter festival to show Questlove, Foo Fighters rock docs and more Oklahoma music news\n\nIn addition to The Friday Night Honky Tonk, the 2021 Born & Raised fest will feature The BBQ Ranch curated by legendary pitmaster Wayne Mueller, owner/pitmaster of Central Texas’ famed Louie Mueller Barbecue.

A few of them even inspire locals to leave town for a bit, simply because they don’t want to deal with the extra traffic.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the top 12 major events in the Reno-Sparks area by date.\n\nReno River Festival\n\nReno’s river festival is relatively a young pup compared to the other events in this list. Despite starting just 15 years ago, however, it has amassed a large following, now attracting 42,000 people downtown. In addition to its whitewater and kayaking events, the festival features a Reno River Roll event for cyclists and a Craft Beer Village. It’s also associated with one of downtown Reno’s iconic attractions, the Truckee River. (Mid-May)\n\nSite: https://renoriverfestival.com/\n\nReno Rodeo\n\nDid you know that John Wayne attended the Reno Rodeo Parade in 1949? First held in 1919, the Reno Rodeo has history that stretches out for almost a century in the Biggest Little City. Featuring traditional rodeo events such as bull riding and steer wrestling as well as kid-friendly attractions like mutton busting, the event attracts more than 140,000 attendees, according to event organizers. It also offers the fourth richest prize pool in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association tour. (Mid-June)\n\nSite: https://www.renorodeo.com/\n\nArtown\n\nBack in 1996 before Midtown made Reno’s downtown a cool place to visit, members of the art, business and civic community joined forces in holding an art festival to help bring folks back to the Biggest Little City’s core. After attracting 30,000 attendees that first year, Artown has grown into an event that attracts about 300,000 people each year, according to event organizers. The festival is a celebration of all things artistic, including events that cater to the visual arts, music, dance, theater, film and literature. It also lasts for an entire month. No kidding. (All of July)\n\nSite: https://renoisartown.com/\n\nLake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival\n\nIf the notion of trading a kingdom for a horse makes you nod with approval, then you won’t need much convincing about the merits of this event. First started in 1972, this celebration of The Bard’s work started with eight performances by the New Shakespeare Company. Since then, the event has turned into one of Lake Tahoe’s iconic events, attracting 30,000 attendees each year to watch live performances seven nights a week from early July to late August. The fact that it’s held at Tahoe’s Sand Harbor is icing on this medieval cake. (Early July to late August)\n\nSite: http://laketahoeshakespeare.com/\n\nAmerican Century Championship celebrity golf\n\nWith beautiful Tahoe views, a $600,000 purse and the opportunity to raise funds for charity, there’s certainly plenty of reason for this event to be a draw. The biggest reason for its popularity, however, is the opportunity to check out its celebrity roster. That includes checking the unique mechanics of perennial participant Charles Barkley's one-of-a-kind golf swing or finding out whether retired NBA player Dell Curry or son Steph Curry will end up jumping into Lake Tahoe after losing a bet. (Mid-July)\n\nSite: http://americancenturychampionship.com/\n\nHot August Nights\n\nThree decades ago, organizers decided to hold a classic car show to fill an empty spot in Reno’s events calendar. Today, this celebration of classic cars and rock and roll is one of the big boys when it comes to happenings in the Biggest Little City. The event brings in about 6,000 classic vehicles, much to the chagrin of residents who just want to make their daily commute through town. Then again, if you’re going to be stuck in traffic on South Virginia Street, you might as well be stuck among '56 Chevys. (Early to mid-August)\n\nSite: https://hotaugustnights.net/\n\nBurning Man\n\nEvery year in late August, tens of thousands of people — just under 70,000 in 2017 — flock to the Black Rock desert 140 miles north of Reno and brave sand, sun and the elements in order to imbibe in this counterculture festival. It could easily have more but attendance is capped, leading to a mad dash for tickets. A celebration of art, self-reliance and community, Burning Man attracts a wide swath of people from free-spirited fellows to big celebrities and company executives. Has it become oversized and overrated? That depends on who you ask. I’ve interviewed folks, for example, who cried when asked what the Burning man experience was like for them. Literally. It also brings a slew of people to Reno on their way to Black Rock, with the Reno-Tahoe International Airport describing Burning Man as its Super Bowl and Mardi Gras rolled into one. Of all events associated with Reno, Burning Man definitely has the most mind share, not just nationally but on a global level as well. (Late August to September)\n\nSite: https://burningman.org/\n\nBest in the West Nugget Rib Cook-off\n\nThe end of summer typically represents a sad time for some. For the city of Sparks, however, it means serving up some great barbecue. About 240,000 pounds of it, according to organizers of the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-off. That’s a far cry from its humble beginnings in 1989, when the inaugural event had nine booths and 30,000 visitors. Today, the event, which has been featured on Food TV and the Cooking Channel, attracts a whopping 500,000 people. Granted, that includes repeat visitors as it counts people who visit multiple times. It also includes plenty of locals, which makes running into acquaintances an annual tradition for residents. (Late August to September)\n\nSite: https://nuggetribcookoff.com/\n\nGreat Reno Balloon Race\n\nAs the heat of summer slowly gives way to the chilly air of fall, thousands of spectators wake up before dawn and head to Rancho San Rafael Park in Reno to watch balloons come to life around them. First started with 20 balloons in 1982, the event now attracts as many as 100 balloons per year and 120,000 spectators. Arrive early to find a good spot and catch the pre-dawn glow show. Just make sure to bundle up.\n\nSite: https://renoballoon.com/\n\nReno Air Races\n\nThe National Championship Air Races event is entering its 55th year in 2018, making it one of the stalwarts of the Reno event calendar. It’s also one of the most exhilarating, featuring an assortment of planes blazing through the skies above Reno-Stead airport. A major accident in 2011 adversely impacted the air races, which continues to deal with its aftereffects. The Reno Air Races, however, soldiers on, adding new events such as drone racing to its stable of prop planes and jets. (Mid-September)\n\nSite: http://airrace.org/\n\nStreet Vibrations\n\nReno-Tahoe turns to hog heaven in late September as motorcycle enthusiasts fill its streets and highways. Started in the early 1990s by Harley-Davidson enthusiasts, the event attracts 50,000 riders each year. Those riders get a lot of mileage, too. In addition to Reno-Sparks, popular stops for participants include Virginia City, Lake Tahoe and Carson City. The event also features a poker run and scavenger hunt as well as music and, of course, plenty of motorcycle vendors. (Late September)\n\nSite: http://roadshowsreno.com/sv_fall.php\n\nEldorado Great Italian Festival\n\nFor nearly four decades, folks have been going downtown in the fall to stomp grapes, drink wine and sample a bevy of Italian dishes at this festival’s many food booths. The Great Italian Festival Sauce Cook-off is also known for attracting Italian families from the West Coast to prove their sauce is the best, with some rivalries going on for generations. Add some Italian music and it’s like having a small slice of Bel Paese.

This bakery isn't your traditional brick-and-mortar operation. It's a brick-and-mortar house peeking out from behind well-manicured shrubbery, blanketed by the leafy shade of two tall sycamore trees near Skiles Nature Park.\n\nA home-based artisan bakery suits Andy Anderson just fine.\n\nRead more here.\n\nA giant rocking chair makes this New Bethel home 'heaven on the front porch'\n\nOnce, a pair of women drove up Steve and Louise Deckard’s driveway to inquire if their house was a gift shop. Although some might say it “looks like a Cracker Barrel,” Louise joked, this place she’s lived in for almost 40 years is a treasure to her.\n\nShe didn’t always feel this way. Louise swore that when she and Steve first moved into their house in 1984, it was an “nasty-looking little dump.” But the Deckards wanted to stay in New Bethel, where Steve’s family roots were already planted.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNorthside comic book store proves some things are immortal\n\nThe Greeks have Zeus. The Romans, Jupiter.\n\nWe have Superman.\n\n“Superheroes,” Tim Reynolds said, “are Americans’ mythology.” They’re legends passed down from one generation of loyal followers to the next.

Waterman building, now housing The Auto Center, has storied history in Five Points\n\nEntering The Auto Center in the Five Points neighborhood, your eyes may be drawn to a colorful rooster greeting you on your way in the door.

To Gretchen Szostak, he was Otis, the leader of a trio of cats called the OGs.\n\nOtis slinked up the porch looking for food and attention. At Szostak’s house, where four giant dogs bound up to the door, he found both. On Szostak’s porch sat an elaborate two-story wooden house, with five openings leading to beds of straw and blankets for stray cats and an occasional raccoon to lay on.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAt Lynhurst Baptist's Wednesday night meals, 'All Are Welcome!'\n\nThere could be many reasons cars line up in the parking lot at Lynhurst Baptist Church on Wednesday nights for a free meal. Maybe the driver is exhausted and needing a break. Maybe they don't want to do the dishes. Maybe they can't afford food.\n\nRegardless, Ben Wakefield, senior pastor, said if there's food in stock, they won't go empty-handed. As the blue font on the church's website says, \"All Are Welcome!\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n2 Amigos Mexican grocery keeps it in the family\n\nConchas caught the boy’s eye, and he didn’t want just one.\n\nThe shelves at Tienda Mexicana 2 Amigos held everything from Mexican chips and candies to prayer candles, but alas, not the sweet breads in bulk. The boy wanted a box, so his mother tracked down Joaquin Zarza.\n\nZarza, an owner and manager at 2 Amigos, tried his best – a stroll up and down the aisles, a trip to the back – with no luck. He sent the boy and his mother on their way with apologies and well wishes: a small gesture that, to Zarza, makes a big difference.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTucked in a Carson Heights garage are Harleys and riders driven by purpose\n\nA handful of shiny Harley-Davidson Road Kings sit tucked inside an unmarked green and white garage off Shelby Street beneath a U.S. flag swaying in the breeze.\n\nIn place of the iconic Harley emblem is another winged logo labeled “Indianapolis Funeral Escort Service.”\n\nGary Harriman, 71, starts his morning tending to the bikes, which roar in and out of the garage multiple times a day.

A squadron of ceiling fans tries, in vain, to battle mid-June humidity.\n\nUFR Martial Arts instructor Ulises F.

Two cottages, bright blue and muted mauve, sit side by side.\n\nBut the houses' defining accessory is a tunnel connecting the two dwellings like hands clasped and connected. It's a unique feature even in a neighborhood full of historic homes.\n\nHelen Small, who currently lives in one of the homes, said the story goes back decades.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn Martindale-Brightwood, an alternative to a junkyard awaits car lovers\n\nTheir hands are caked in grime as they wrench at the car. Their toolbox sits nearby. They’ve spent hours at the yard, but for regulars at the Pull-A-Part in Martindale-Brightwood, the end result is worth it.\n\nEvery day, customers take their pick of car parts among the sea of automobiles — however obscure. The only catch: They need to remove the pieces themselves. Two dollars is all one needs to get into the yard. For those who find what they want, they’ll pay a reasonable price versus what they’d pay for a new part.\n\nPrindell Young said that’s part of the appeal. But mostly, he enjoys the do-it-yourself spirit.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTha Corn Man fires up Mexican street corn in Fall Creek Place food truck\n\nShrouded in charcoal smoke in a Dollar General lot, Timmy Campbell is trying to start his generator.\n\nThe Houston native is, to his loyal customers in Fall Creek Place, just Tha Corn Man. “Hey Corn Man!” they’d call out. His food truck’s front plate reads: Corny. He calls his 10-year-old daughter “the Corn Cob Kid.”\n\nThe love for elotes sprung from his Texas childhood, when Mexican street corn was abundant at food trucks. Then came the Gary of his teens, when Campbell would wake up to the corn man’s bell ringing down the street.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHe'd fish in the Amazon if he could, but this Crossfield pond has something more unique\n\nThe pond is still, and green. The grass around it has been tamed by mowers. It's guarded by tract homes on one side and a 2-way road on the other. No towering forests, or White River-like currents.\n\nBut the fishing is decent, and that’s enough. Soon, when the weather warms, the young fishers of Crossfield will bike out here with their poles and toss lines into the water.\n\n“It’s run by the kids around here,” Matthew Danz, 19, says, as he watches his bobber – a dot asleep on the surface. Waiting for it to talk to him.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIndy's Irish Ink, where art meets pain therapy\n\nHannah McKenry has a good feeling about turning 27. It's a year for change.\n\n\"It's a pandemic thing — I completely lost my mid-20s. It feels like I jumped from my early to my late,\" she said. \"And I feel really ready to change my life.\"\n\nShe decided to mark that milestone with a tattoo, specifically a birthday cake featured on an album by American dream pop duo Beach House.\n\nAs it works out, her tattoo artist and friend, Kay Robertson, was free at Irish Ink Tattoo and Piercing in the Perry Meridian neighborhood of Indianapolis' south side. Even as other tattoo shops opened and closed, the tattoo parlor on Meridian Street stuck around.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSkate park in Stout Field fills niche in city's skateboarding community\n\nTucked inside an unassuming warehouse in Stout Field, you'll find the city's only indoor skate park.\n\nQ Skatepark, 1727 Stout Field East Drive, provides a weatherproof haven for first-time skateboarders and experienced riders alike. The cavernous space with its graffitied walls has even hosted skateboarding icon Tony Hawk and rapper Lil Wayne.\n\nBryan and Shane Apolskis opened the park in 2016. The same warehouse also serves as headquarters for their event management business, Sequence, which puts on the city's St. Patrick's Day parade.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNora restaurant offers slice of Burmese history, and cuisine\n\nStep into Htaw Metta on a busy weekend afternoon and you might hear five different languages in the cozy Nora restaurant; patrons chatter in Burmese, Karen, Thai, or English and in the kitchen, Mon, another Burmese language.\n\nThe language mélange reflects both the eatery’s cuisine ‒ a mix of sushi, Thai, and Burmese offerings ‒ and the owner’s life story.\n\nBorn in then-Burma, now Myanmar, near the Thai border, Htira Rammahtaw belongs to the Mon people, one of Myanmor’s many ethnic groups.

But for the sharp squeak of tennis shoes, the occasional tweet of a coach's whistle and faint shouts from boys playing basketball, all was peaceful and quiet.\n\nRead more here.\n\nBuddhist temple and sculpture garden call Indianapolis east side community home\n\nIt's tucked away so that most passersby wouldn't even know it's there. But on South Franklin Road in Indianapolis' Raymond Park neighborhood, hidden behind a house, is a Buddhist temple and sculpture garden.\n\nThe Phap An Temple made the eastside community home a few years ago. When they bought the football-field-sized lot, it was overgrown and full of brush, said Deborah Nguyen, a Temple member. But members worked to clear it out and turn it into something special.\n\nRead more here.\n\nLantern Hills church combines outreach and nature to serve its community\n\nA church located on about 3.3 acres of mostly woodsy land in Lantern Hills is an oasis of hope and help for its congregation and east-side neighbors.\n\nThe Church of the Nativity-Episcopal goes beyond traditional worship to be a community resource. On the second Saturday of each month, for instance, volunteers distribute free pet food to families in need ― a ministry started during the pandemic. And when unexpected life events arise, members step up to cook and deliver hot meals.\n\nRead more here.\n\n'Little winks from the universe' have shaped this bar in Twin Aire\n\nFinding used furniture in one’s preferred color palette might seem trifling. But not to Nicole Oesch ― not if you know the history of Kismetic, a bar and brewery she and husband Ryan own in Twin Aire.\n\nKismetic opened for business in April 2022.

The Southsider Voice likely has the hardest working staff of 70 and 80-somethings in the business.\n\n“I pinch myself every day to be 78 and still active,” said Editor Al Stilley. “It’s rewarding when readers say picking up the paper is like meeting an old friend.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nA blue star flag in Pheasant Run displays a proud father's patriotism\n\nYou can see the creases on the blue star flag that hangs above Dewain Divelbliss’s home in the Pheasant Run neighborhood on the southside.\n\nThat’s because Divelbliss, 58, doesn’t go too long without replacing the flag once it starts getting worn down, out of respect for his daughter who is currently deployed in Kosovo.\n\nIt was hard, he said, dropping her off at basic training camp.\n\n“You know, when you’re a father, you always swore that you would protect your kids,” Divelbliss said. “But I realized when driving home that day, and when she raised her hand and took her oath, she was now going to protect me.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe landscape in Drexel Gardens has changed. For one resident, a comforting constant remains\n\n“I just like roosters,” smiled Debra Hancock in a poultry-themed purple hoodie. They've been a familiar presence to her since childhood.\n\nWhen little, she traveled every summer to her grandmother’s house in Arkansas. There chickens roamed freely, and her family pitched in helping to prepare them for mealtimes.

Gradowski\n\nSand traps, water, divots and hazards of all kinds are usually what golfers are used to facing. The best play through those obstacles and still find themselves at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nAt the University of Detroit Mercy however, one golfer was given a challenge that you can't practice for, but with the determination and the strength shown by her mother, she was able to excel both on and off the course, and now the two of them are just acing every hole that they encounter.\n\nIt was just another trip to the doctor for Carol Thompson, mother of then-sophomore Sarah Thompson, a Canton resident and graduate of Plymouth High School, where she starred in girls golf.\n\nBut the early September day was nothing ordinary as the Thompson family was rocked with the news that would change their life. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was just pure coincidence, but Sarah just happened to be with her mom at the initial testing.\n\n\"I went with her to the yearly mammogram visit and you normally don't get the results back for a few days,\" said Sarah. \"I went with her just to go with her, not really thinking anything about it. It was just a normal visit for the exam and something she has done for so many years now.\"\n\nAfter the routine mammogram, Carol was told that she needed to go back to see the doctor, and that is where the journey began.\n\n\"When they called saying they needed her to go back, I knew I had to be there because they normally don't tell you to come back if everything is fine,\" said Sarah. \"I went to the follow-up appointment and I was there when they told us she had breast cancer.\"\n\n\"When you get news like this, everything just seems so surreal,\" said Carol. \"You are just shocked, but we had to take the news head on and deal with it from that point.\"\n\nThe mother and daughter arrived home and with help from the entire family, the Thompson's got together and did the only thing they could do – get ready to tee off on their next challenge.\n\n\"At first, you are just shocked. You don't know what to expect and I don't think my mom really knew either. The first day was just about absorbing it and taking it all in and then after that came all the planning. It got hectic, chaotic, stressful, and emotional, everything that you would think about would come with news like that,\" added Sarah.\n\nWhat to do\n\nThe 2014 fall golf season was just about to begin and for Sarah Thompson and Titans, they came into the year as back-to-back defending Horizon League champions. Thompson was the HL Freshman of the Year in 2013-2014 as the red, white and blue stormed back from eight shots down to shock Oakland and claim its second-straight title.\n\nNow as the 2014-15 season started, Thompson was counted on to assume a much larger role on the team, both on and off the course due to the graduation of a few seniors, but the news had her doubting if she could continue to play golf and help her team.\n\n\"It was something I needed to get over. There were times I talked to coach Ryan (Terri Anthony-Ryan) and thought that maybe I shouldn't go to a tournament because mentally, I didn't think I would be there, but she would always calm me down and bring me back to earth a bit,\" said Sarah. \"My mom would then tell me that, you can't miss a tournament because of me, that is not a good excuse, but it was definitely hard looking over and not seeing her.\"\n\nThe Titans' fall schedule consisted of four tournaments, three of which would have been easy drives within a few hours for Carol to make. Sarah would now have to walk without her mother behind her for those events, but with her mom fighting the battle, so was Sarah. She claimed runner-up at the Loyola Fall Invitational and was fourth at the Dayton Fall Invite, all while ending the non-traditional season leading the team in scoring average.\n\n\"A lot had to do with the fight that my mom was putting up,\" said Sarah. \"She was fighting so hard to beat this, and her passion and emotion for that carried over to me and my golf game and school work. I was able to pick up on her aggressive attitude and relate that to my life. It helped me so much and motivated me every single day.\"\n\n\"I think like any parent would have done, I told her that I didn't want to be the cause of her missing out on anything,\" said Carol. \"If it was a golf tournament, school function or just a social event, I told her that she could not miss any of them due to my condition.\"\n\nThe fall came to an end with Sarah posting three top-20 performances and two top-10 efforts, and the long winter break was about to kick in for the Detroit golf team.\n\nBattle for life\n\nCarol Thompson had already started chemotherapy during the fall season, which prevented her from attending any of the fall events. She was also hospitalized a few times during her bout.\n\nThe battle against breast cancer is always a fight for survival. Just look at some of the facts from the National Breast Cancer Foundation:\n\n•One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.\n\n•Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women.\n\n•Each year it is estimated that over 220,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 40,000 will die.\n\nWith that said, the NBCF also lists that death rates from breast cancer have been declining since 1990, in part to screening and early detection, increased awareness, and continually improving treatment options. For the Thompson's, the early detection meant an early start for the fight.\n\n\"Breast Cancer Awareness is every day, not just one month,\" said Sarah. \"The good thing about it is that it does get all the information out there and reminds people to go and get checked out. You can fight this and beat it, but the earlier you catch anything wrong, the better the chances are. It can happen to anybody, so we need to stay on top of things and always make sure to go to those yearly appointments.\"\n\n\"I remember telling Sarah and her teammates that this news was like hitting a shot out of bounds or in the woods. You just have to pick yourself up. It is not a shot that you want, but you have to deal with it and just figure out how you can score,\" added Carol.\n\nIn it together\n\nThe fight and support extended well beyond the Thompson family. Ask any student-athlete and they will tell you that their team, teammates and coaching staff are all just another part of their family. Any winning team will tell you that they are as close to their team as they are to their own relatives and that closeness helps separate the regular teams from championship squads.\n\nSarah had that family in her corner right from the start. From her head coach to her teammates, athletic and school administration and that all help foster an atmosphere of continued success.\n\n\"Coach Ryan's philosophy is family, school and then golf, and she always says that so she was a huge help in all of this,\" Sarah said. \"My teammates were great, my roommates were great, all of the professors here at Detroit were understanding of what I was going through, and I couldn't ask for a better support system from all of them and my family.\"\n\n\"Coach Ryan would call me all the time, and I would get texts and Facebook messages from the team on a daily basis,\" said Carol. \"They made things a lot easier on me, and I know Sarah was well-taken care off.\"\n\nBack on the course\n\nSpring is the season of life. It's the season when the weather begins to get warmer, flowers start to bloom, and the leaves start to grow. In Division I golf, spring is the championship season and as the weather started to turn, the Titans were right back on the golf course getting ready to make another run at a title.\n\nDetroit would play in four spring events before the Horizon League Championship, but when the Titans made their annual trip to Florida, Carol was still not in any condition to visit the Sunshine State to see her daughter Sarah and the rest of the team.\n\n\"I would text coach Ryan and coach Lammers all the time to see how the team was doing,\" said Carol. \"They always kept me updated so for me, that constant communication made it just a little easier to get through everything since I could not be there.\"\n\nCarol was determined to make it back to the course to see Sarah and the team play and that appearance was at the IPFW Spring Classic in early April. Carol was able to come down for one round and see her daughter play again.\n\n\"She tried to make every event that she could, but she couldn't travel to any in the fall because of the chemotherapy. She really couldn't, and I didn't want her to come and then have her get even sicker with her immune system down. She finally came to our IPFW tournament in the spring. It was only for one day, but that was enough for me,\" Sarah said.\n\nSarah ended the regular season among the Horizon League leaders in scoring average and was named All-Horizon League, but she didn't know the surprise she was getting when the conference championship came around.\n\n\"I honestly didn't think she was going to be able to come to the Horizon League Championship, and I didn't want to give my hopes up, but when she did, something happened. It just gave me a spark, and I played with even more confidence out there,\" added Sarah.\n\nThompson was in the top 10 all weekend long and would end up tying for third with a career-best 232. With her mother on her mind all season long, she would end up ranking fifth in the HL with a career-best 78.43 average. She was in the top 20 eight times with four top-10 finishes. In the classroom, she was a member of the Detroit Athletic Director's Honor Roll and the Horizon League Fall and Spring Academic Honor Rolls.\n\n\"She always told me that I am doing what I have to do to get better, so I need you to just focus on your goals,\" Sarah said. \"Sometimes, she would say, 'I am doing what I have to do to see you play in the spring so go out there, continue to work hard and make it worth me watching when I finally get back out there' and she would say that with a smile to fire me up. It worked.\"\n\n\"I really don't know how she was able to do everything she did with this on her mind,\" said Carol. \"I am so impressed with my daughter. My mom was diagnosed with cancer when I was in college and I fell apart, so I am so proud that she was able to stay focused.\"\n\nAll the way back\n\nWith Carol getting better every day, the summer was one of joy and jubilation for the Thompson family. While the day in April was a great celebration to see her mom finally able to make it back out to a tournament, perhaps no day could match July 6 at a Taylormade Adidas Midwest Collegiate Series amateur event.\n\nIt was on that day that Carol caddied for her daughter, and Sarah would go on to win the event, firing a 1-under 70 in the first round and ending the competition with a 148 score and a two-stroke victory.\n\n\"She was able to stay as strong and positive as possible, and I still don't know to this day how she was able to do that. All of this just makes you appreciate what you have. Your friends, family, the ability to play a sport you love and to go to school for it, it makes you cherish everything,\" added Sarah.\n\nMeanwhile, Carol had her last chemotherapy in early Septemeber and one last minor surgery recently. She is now a survivor, a true fighter and a winner for everything she did during her year-long battle, and there may be no easier example of her relentless strength than seeing what her daughter accomplished during this time.\n\nP.J.

The scale and layout of the land capture how it was used and subdivided by generations of Quaker families, he says.\n\n“Exploring Beaver Valley is a great way to contextualize the park and show why people settled here,” McKinley says. “It’s a place frozen in time.”\n\nHere's how he recommends visitors go exploring.\n\nFounding the New World\n\n• Ryves Holt House is Delaware’s oldest house. It dates back to 1665, just 34 years after the first European settlement of Delaware, a Dutch commercial effort called Zwaanendael that only lasted a year. The Dutch returned in 1658 to settle, creating Lewes.\n\n“The Dutch and Swedes often get little mention in American history and the story of the country’s mixing pot,” said Michael DiPaolo, executive director of the Lewes Historical Society, which uses the Ryves Holt House as its visitor center. “But once they hear about it, they’re intrigued by it.”\n\n• Fort Christina is where the Swedes first landed in 1638, and only the boulders that gave the name to the site (The Rocks) remain from so long ago. Visitors will get a deeper and more fulfilling perspective on New Sweden at the adjacent Kalmar Nyckel Foundation (a museum and a re-creation of a tall ship used four times by Swedish and Finnish settlers) and Old Swedes Church, built in 1698-99 a short walk away. The Christina Cultural Trail Pass for all three is $8. The church’s roots go back to 1640, when the first services led by a priest of the Church of Sweden were held at Fort Christina.\n\nMore:Kalmar Nyckel becomes official Tall Ship of Delaware\n\n• New Castle was founded in 1651, and its strategic location drew shifting control by the Dutch, Swedes and British. The New Castle Court House was built in 1732 on the foundation of a 1680s court, and the site served as Delaware’s first court and state capitol. “Three Forts, One Community,” an exhibit in the museum, covers the European power play and Native Americans. “The three Delaware counties grew to resent Pennsylvania’s Quaker-led assembly and in 1704 established their own legislature in New Castle,” according to to the park’s new brochure.\n\n• William Penn founded Dover in 1683, right after he landed in the New World. He called for three squares: Meetinghouse Square (for the Quakers like him), Church Square (the first Presbyterian church was built in 1708) and Courthouse Square, which became The Green and was laid out in 1717.\n\n• In the early 18th century, first- and second-generation Quaker immigrants established farms and mills along the Beaver and Brandywine creeks. Swaths are still farmed (Ramsey’s Farm offers school field trips and a fall fun for all, with details at www.ramseysfarm.com), but modern technology means you’ll only see remnants of the mills.\n\nBecoming America\n\n• John Dickinson was nicknamed the penman of the revolution because of his passionate writing, starting with 12 letters in 1767-68 that “were an appeal to reason to avert or postpone a break with England,” the National Park Service says. “From infancy, I was taught to love humanity and liberty,” he wrote in the first letter, anonymously credited to “a farmer in Pennsylvania.” “Our goal is to bring his story to life and show that the words he penned 250 years ago are still full of meaning today,” said Gloria Henry, supervisor of the plantation.\n\n• At the New Castle Court House on June 15, 1776, the Assembly of the Three Lower Counties declared independence from Pennsylvania and England and decided to call the colony the Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex Upon Delaware. Separation Day is celebrated with a festival in mid-June. The Declaration of Independence was first read in Delaware from the building balcony on July 14, 1776. Museum staffers conduct two indoor building tours for the general public, one a basic tour and another on the Underground Railroad and key trials there.\n\n• Wartime fears led Delaware to move its capital from New Castle to Dover in 1777. At the Golden Fleece, a now-demolished tavern on Dover’s Green, 30 men voted on Dec. 7, 1787 to ratify the new U.S. Constitution, making Delaware the first state. That vote is celebrated as Delaware Day. The tavern also hosted the 1790 discussion of the Bill of Rights. The Old State House on the Green housed Delaware’s legislature from its 1791 construction to the 1933 move to Legislative Hall.\n\n• The Lewes Historical Society in April started hosting tavern talks at the Ryves Holt House, which DiPaolo called “interactive debates” about the pressing issues of 1777. These programs get their title from the house (once a tavern), historical context (Colonial taverns served as meeting places) and ambiance (beer for the modern sessions). The house was also a witness, he said, to nearby riots over how delegates were elected to that Constitutional meeting at the Golden Fleece, and that argument pitting western vs. eastern Sussex eventually led to moving the county seat to Georgetown.\n\nLewes was a key access point for vessels trading to and from Philadelphia (America’s capital from 1790 to 1800), and the subject of a blockade and bombardment in April 1813, as part of the War of 1812. A memorable reminder is the historical society’s maritime museum, called the Cannonball House for the cannonball stuck in its side. The society programs multiple historic structures, including the Lewes History Museum, not quite a mile away, at 101 Adams Ave.\n\n• Soldiers, primarily British and Hessians, were quartered near Old Swedes Church during the Revolutionary War, said Rebecca Wilson, executive director of the Old Swedes Foundation. Records also show them demanding religious services in the church.\n\nDelaware’s natural side\n\n• With the rolling hills, mossy stone walls, serene woods, meandering waterways and a patchwork of farmland, the 1,100 acres that form Beaver Valley are the most picturesque part of the park. The best spots to start exploring are from the Smith Bridge or Thompsons Bridge parking areas, which also offer picnic tables, fishing and canoe/tubing access. Eighteen miles of trails for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding crisscross the park and connect to Brandywine Creek State Park to the south.\n\n“The park is extremely biodiverse,” McKinley said, with bald eagles and great herons among its signature species. Citizen scientists in 2016 documented 116 species in Beaver Valley. An app called iNaturalist helps visitors identify new species and add to the total.\n\n“It’s the next best thing to having a ranger at your shoulder,” he said.\n\nCloverleaf Stables offers horseback rides from its Beaver Valley Road stables. A reservation-only one-hour ride is $50, and longer rides allow time to take horses swimming or explore more of the 2,000 acres in the federal park and adjacent green space. Details: http://cloverleaf-stables.com, 484-841-6230.\n\nWilderness Canoe Trips offers $23 unguided tubing trips in warmer weather from Smith Bridge to Thompson Bridge. The Brandywine is “a very slow, meandering river,” it says on www.wildernesscanoetrips.com, averaging 2 to 3 feet deep. The 1.5-mile trip takes two hours.\n\nThe Wilmington Trail Club often organizes hikes in the park. Details: www.wilmingtontrailclub.org.\n\nThose fishing, except children and seniors, need state fishing licenses and must follow state rules. Catch-and-release is recommended, and if fish are eaten, the state recommends consumption limits.\n\n“Brandywine Creek proper (non-tidal) has the largest population of smallmouth bass in the state, and also contains largemouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed, crappie, channel catfish, muskellunge, tiger muskellunge, white sucker, yellow perch, common carp,” the state says. “Species in Beaver Run are typically smaller fish — smallmouth, largemouth, rock bass, bluegill, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed, catfish, white suckers, yellow perch, common carp.” Beaver Run, in the northern edge of Beaver Valley, is also stocked with trout.\n\nStream Stewards, a program coordinated by the Nature Conservancy, involves citizen scientists to track the health of the waterways in Beaver Valley — source of all of Wilmington’s water. Details: www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/delaware/events/delaware-stream-stewards-citizen-science.xml.\n\nA few families enjoy the valley all the time by renting a house there. The most spectacular recent listing was an 18th-century stone colonial with a five-car garage and pond on 2 acres.\n\nDelaware’s only cave, which inspired the cave in “Dead Poets Society,” is on Beaver Dam Road.\n\n• From Fort Christina, anglers are most likely to encounter white sucker, channel catfish, bluegill, largemouth bass, crappie, pumpkinseed, redbreast sunfish, common carp and yellow perch.\n\n• “The Green is a really cool microcosm of trees,” said Sarah Zimmerman, superintendent of First State Heritage Park, noting it includes elm, sycamore, dawn redwood, juniper, maple, locust, holly and Kentucky coffee. It looks nice now, but that’s a Victorian creation. Old newspapers ran complaints about broken fences, scraggly grass and feeding pigs (but cows were OK). The Green hosts Dover Days (starting in 2018), summer concerts, a Shakespeare play and an 18th-century market fair.\n\n• John Dickinson cared about preservation, said Gloria Henry, site manager of the John Dickinson Plantation. He told his slaves (he released them by 1786) and tenants (he had a lot, since he owned 5,000 acres, although the plantation is down to 18) they couldn’t cut down healthy live trees.\n\nMake a Splash, an annual festival, teaches hundreds of schoolchildren about water resources at the plantation and the St. Jones Reserve.\n\nMore:Frog Hollow, a Wilmington Garden Club tour staple, gets new owners\n\nBiking the route\n\nA devoted cyclist could hit all the sites, but it’s about 100 miles, longer to avoid busy roads.\n\nIt’s much more realistic to bike the between Dover’s Green and the John Dickinson Plantation. A less-trafficked route takes 9 miles along Del. 8/South Little Creek Road and Del. 9/Bayside Drive.\n\nThe four New Castle County sites are doable by bike, especially after the Jack Markell Trail opens in June, after a decade of advocacy. The 8-mile trail runs south from the Wilmington Riverfront, tied to a 1.5-mile trail running to the New Castle Court House. From the Wilmington Riverfront, city streets reach Fort Christina and Old Swedes Church and then north to the Brandywine.\n\nThe Northern Delaware Greenway then gives bicyclists a decent ride (watch out for the bumps and the steep grade in Alapocas Run State Park), and it’s back to roadways until a dedicated trail pops up in Brandywine Creek State Park, leading directly into another dedicated trail in Beaver Valley.\n\nOn delawaregreenways.org, Delaware Greenways colors in trail ideas that would cover the entire length of the Brandywine, from the Pennsylvania line to its juncture with the Christina.\n\nAll about architecture\n\n• The area around the New Castle Court House is second in the country in number and authenticity of its Colonial and Federal structures. The courthouse is in Georgian style, and a window on the floor allows visitors to peek into the 1680s foundation. Some interesting elements in the museum, according to site supervisor Cindy Snyder, include a chair for the Assembly speaker, used since Colonial days; and ironclad doors installed in an 1845 renovation in an attempt to make some rooms fireproof.\n\nInteresting elements that used to exist nearby include a 44-cell jail that began the county prison system, a separate debtors prison and a whipping post (whipping was legal in Delaware until 1952) with a pillory on a platform on the top.\n\nThe adjacent Sheriff’s House, planned to become the park visitor center, is an 1858 Victorian brownstone. Three walking tours run by the museum explore the area, focusing on the Green, veterans and nearby buildings.\n\n• Old Swedes Church has the oldest known pulpit in the U.S., with a canopy projecting the speaker’s voice. The pews, 1899 reproductions, could be closed to keep out drafts and are raised so the doors would not catch on the uneven brick floor. Even so, “worshippers often brought heated rocks or pans of hot coals into their pews to keep themselves warm,” the church says. Through the 1700s, Swedish custom called for men on the right and women on the left.\n\nThe congregation outgrew Old Swedes, building Trinity Chapel at Fifth and King streets in 1830 and moving again in 1882 to Adams Street. Along the way, members restored Old Swedes. One unusual element they left is graffiti — mostly just initials and dates but also a drawing of the church.\n\nThe Hendrickson House was moved from Pennsylvania to the grounds in 1958. Although some date it to before 1690, Wilson said the latest research places its construction to 1720 to 1736. It was likely built for new widow Catherine Hendrickson and is “a large home for a wealthy family,” Wilson said.\n\n• John Dickinson’s father built the main house in 1739-40, and it stayed in the family until 1933, becoming a museum in 1956. It’s an early Georgian mansion (restored after an 1804 fire), illustrating “telescope type of planning, in which a series of smaller wings are added to the main house at later dates,” the National Park Service says.\n\nMultiple outbuildings have been reconstructed: granary, feed barn, double corn crib, stable, smokehouse and slave/tenant house (a log cabin with a dirt floor).\n\nThe plantation only has a few items owned by John Dickinson, Henry said, including his travel inkwell, a razor he planned to give as a gift, a teapot, some plates and some books.\n\n• First State Heritage Park includes several buildings on The Green. One is the John Bell House, probably built as a simple workshop in the 1740s, used for multiple purposes over the decades, including a post office, and now as the park visitor center. “It’s just a humble building, but visitors are intrigued that it’s been there the whole time,” Zimmerman said. It’s a rare example of Chesapeake vernacular style — rare because most such wooden buildings have not lasted the centuries.\n\nAnother interesting building on The Green is the Old State House, built in 1791 in Georgian style. Notable details include the gilt sunflower ceiling sham and the dual stairways up to the legislative chambers. And the Kent County Courthouse, built in 1874 in Second Empire style, is open for First Saturday programs, in which varied sites in the park explore the same theme once a month.\n\nAll the other buildings on The Green are private residences or offices, Zimmerman said, highlighting the Parke-Ridgely House, which was built in the 1730s in the hall and parlor style and renovated over the centuries in styles reflecting the changing look of the area. The Green is also a microcosm of architectural styles, including Second Empire and Italianate.\n\nArchitectural tours of Dover’s Green are offered on some Saturdays, on by appointment for groups.\n\n• The stone farmhouses dotting Beaver Valley are “similar in size, materials, layouts and ornamentation to those forbearers in England and Ireland,” the park says. As technology and the economics of farming changed, structures like bank barns and springhouses were abandoned. At least eight structures from the 18th century remain on the property, preserved as a private park starting in 1906 by Quaker industrialist William Poole Bancroft.\n\n• The Ryves Holt House (named for Delaware’s first chief justice, also speaker of the House and a sheriff) is in Delaware Valley Dutch vernacular style. It’s one of 14 Lewes Historical Society buildings of varied styles, including an 1898 bank used as the museum store; the Cannonball House from about 1760, with its War of 1812 cannonball; the 1884 Life-Saving Station, which the society says is “best known for its heroic surfmen’s actions during the great blizzard of 1888”; and the society museum.\n\nThe nine buildings in the society’s Shipcarpenter Street complex include a plank house from about 1690; a house from about 1720; a house from about 1740, which the society says “reflects the hard and simple life of southern Delaware’s 18th century farmers”; a Federal-style house from about 1789; a blacksmith shop from about 1790; a clapboard Sussex County farmhouse from about 1800; a country store from about 1800; a doctor’s office from 1840, the only example of Greek Revival architecture in Lewes; and a one-room school from 1898. The 1720 house is the only one on its original foundation. Period furnishings make the past come alive in all of them.\n\n“Delaware’s natural resources were historically valued for serving human needs,” the park brochure says. “Today, thanks to Bancroft and many others, they are valued for just being themselves.”\n\nMore:State's history of lobotomies preserved at Georgetown mental institution\n\nMore:Expedia likes Dover as state's 'Best Place to Escape'\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nFirst State National Historical Park consists of seven sites.

In addition to that, there will be applications for grants we will give to nonprofit, Sussex County based charitable organizations who will justify their need for this funding.\"\n\nBeebe Healthcare was also named as a charitable recipient by Festival of Cheer.\n\nThe event took over most of the Lewes Ferry Terminal complex and part of nearby Cape Henlopen State Park from its official opening on Nov. 19 and was open through New Year's Day.\n\nFestival of Cheer officers said they hoped to see maybe 30,000 visitors over the six weeks of the event and raise about $50,000 with the help of a few corporate sponsors.\n\nAt a wrap party and appreciation event for partners, sponsors and volunteers on Jan. 12, event producer John Briccotto announced that over 47,000 visitors from 26 states attended the event, raising $150,000.\n\nPart of the funds have already been distributed, with $40,000 going to the Cape Henlopen Educational Foundation and Delaware State Parks. Another $65,000 has been set aside to provide grants for other charities devoted to health, education, culture or environmental causes.\n\n\"Shortly we will announce our Winter WonderFEST grant award program,\" said Josh Grapski, Festival of Cheer treasurer. \"Any Sussex County organization will have an opportunity to apply for support for their work in any of these four areas of community service.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Bakery started from cancer wakeup call, now expanding\n\nPartnering with Festival of Cheer to organize the event were Delaware State Parks, the Cape May-Lewes Ferry Authority, residential developer Schell Brothers and La Vida Hospitality Group, owners of Nage; Big Chill Surf Cantina; the Taco Reho food truck and Crooked Hammock Brewery.\n\nAlthough many of the 65 corporate sponsors donated money, others donated time, resources, manpower or other services-in-kind. The festival required at least 20 volunteers per night to run it. They got 30 nearly every one of the 29 nights that WinterFEST was open.\n\nEd and Jan O'Brien, of Lewes, brought their grandchildren to the festival in early December.\n\nThey were trying out the I-rink — a skating rink that used synthetic ice.\n\n\"It was a little less slippery than actual ice,\" said granddaughter Alia Justiniani.\n\n\"This is a really nice event,\" O'Brien said in a previous interview. \"The kids had a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe \"Light Spectacular,\" a 2-mile drive-through holiday light show, opened Nov. 19.

Year after year, the impact of Winter WonderFEST can do more and more for Lewes,\" said Lewes Chamber of Commerce president Betsy Reamer.\n\nOfficially announced on Aug. 30, the festival was promoted by a kick-off party at Crooked Hammock on Sept. 22, attended by 200 people. The Light Spectacular was previewed on Nov. 18 during a 5K fun run and walk through the drive-through course called \"Dashing through the Show,\" attended by 2,000 people.\n\nBriccotto said that they already had 30,000 visitors by Dec. 17, when the festival was still only open weekends, and $45,000 of this year's receipts has been earmarked for next year's festival.\n\n\"2016 was just the beginning. We counted on the people of Delaware and they showed up from everywhere, everyone from locals throughout Sussex County and all over the state and all around the country,\" Briccotto said at the Jan. 12 party. \"We're committed to making Winter WonderFEST even bigger and brighter for 2017.\"\n\nThis year's plans include expanding the Light Spectacular, adding a second rink with real ice, and an enclosed outdoor food and drink vendor.

"Along the sandy coast of Cape Henlopen State Park there is a historical monument that will take visitors back to the World War II era this Saturday.\n\nThe Fort Miles Historical Association’s annual Delaware Goes to War will recreate the surrender of German U-boat 858 in May 1945 – the first foreign surrender on American soil since the War of 1812 – while also highlighting what life was like when Fort Miles was buzzing with activity.\n\nThe day of living history will also feature tours of the museum, which served as a key coastal defense from World War II through the early 1970s, and will recognize several military veterans at the museum’s Wall of Honor, which includes more than 400 names.\n\n“It has turned into the best thing that we do,” said Fort Miles Historical Association President and co-founder Gary Wray.\n\nDotti Wiker, who oversees the Wall of Honor along with her husband, George, said eight veterans who served in several different wars will be honored this weekend.\n\n“Their history needs to be told,” she said. “Although they don’t feel that they’re anything special, they are.”\n\nThe Delaware Goes to War Open House will focus on the World War II victory in Europe, declared on May 8, 1945, and includes an artillery firing demonstration, a look at garrison life at Fort Miles, music, speakers, films and a re-enactment of the surrender of German U-Boat 858.\n\nBoy Scouts from Milford will help run the mess hall, while others will flesh out a living history of the U-boat surrender.\n\n“These kids are all hyped up because it’s living history,” Wray said. “It’s just a wonderful day.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nDelaware Goes to War\n\nWhen: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday, April 28, with events scheduled every 30 minutes\n\nWhere: Fort Miles Historical Area

inland", "text": "The state is moving more than 80,000 items retrieved from a shipwreck out of a small trailer on top of a dune in Cape Henlopen State Park to a more protected facility in Dover.\n\n\"The facility has served its purpose well but we are at the point now that storing a collection here on the sand dunes might not be the best idea,\" state curator of archeology Paul Nasca said. \"A saltwater atmosphere is not good for curation.\"\n\nThe trailer served as an archeology laboratory to study the shipwreck bits that started being found on Lewes Beach decades ago, kicked up by dredging.\n\nMembers of Delaware's Historical and Cultural Affairs office have long joked that a coastal storm would one day scatter artifacts along Rehoboth Beach.\n\nUnlucky 'Buoy 13' stranded on Woodland Beach and visitors love it\n\nIt's one reason Nasca and others anxiously followed Hurricane Florence as it made its way up the East Coast last week.\n\nMore than 75 percent of the historical artifacts from the shipwreck have now been moved to Dover while a new building is being constructed, but some pieces remain in the lab.\n\nCape Henlopen has been the laboratory's home for 14 years, but the artifacts began showing up in the 1980s.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day in 1984, Nasca said phone calls started coming in from people who found old stoneware, pieces of glass jars, pewter tableware and metal objects on Lewes Beach.\n\nHe said it's not unusual for people to find objects on Delaware beaches, but the rate at which they were being found was unusual.\n\n\"A local volunteer who worked for Historical and Cultural Affairs and had an archeological background was having Thanksgiving dinner at her father's house and went to take a look,\" he said. \"A phone call quickly came back saying we needed to get down there.\"\n\nHurricane Florence: Bowers Fire Co. prepares for coastal flooding\n\nNasca said beach dredging had disturbed the shipwreck and artifacts were carried by the waves to the beach.\n\nThe Roosevelt Inlet Shipwreck project has undergone various phases — including controlled beach collection and underwater archeology — and continues today.\n\n\"This is a part of the identity of who we are as a state,\" Nasca said. \"This is a tangible record of the past and a uniquely Lewes story.\"\n\nFaye Stocum, an archeologist for the Delaware Historical and Cultural Affairs, said the identity of the ship, which went down at the mouth of the Delaware Bay, has been a mystery.\n\nIt was first identified as the Severn, an English vessel that sank in about 1780.\n\nBut after years of research, she believes the artifacts come from the Dutch vessel Maria Johanna.\n\nReport: Underwater archeological investigation of the Roosevelt Inlet Shipwreck\n\nThat vessel traded between Holland and Philadelphia, she said. In the winter of 1779, it was stuck in ice at the mouth of the Delaware Bay and was eventually crushed and sank.\n\nNasca said the items that people have found on the beach over the years make him certain of the vessel's origin.\n\nPeople found adult and children's toys on the vessel, as well as window glass coming from Europe. Also found were pipe stems and many thick stoneware jugs that carried gin.\n\n\"Tobacco was big then, so we have recovered a lot of pipes,\" Nasca said. \"And a lot of the bottles we found contained spirits for folks in Philadelphia.\"\n\nThe 18th-century bling found on the wreck and on the beach mostly consisted of silver and pewter shoe buckles, which were fashionable then.\n\nThe last artifacts to be moved are those that have been in wet storage for decades, Nasca said.\n\nThose items, many of which are fused together, have been undergoing a process to rid them of saltwater so they can be dried and preserved.\n\nThe state's goal is to get everything out of water before the final move.\n\nMuch of the ship's cargo remains at the site in the water, Nasca said. Maritime and federal laws prohibit diving on the shipwreck, so it has remained untouched.\n\nThere is no marker. The state of Delaware decided long ago to keep the exact location under wraps to deter those who might be tempted to dive there.\n\n\"You never want to take it all,\" Nasca said. \"You sample it and leave the rest to be preserved unless it is going to be completely destroyed.\"\n\nPeople still find artifacts on the beach, he said. Some are on display at the Zwaanendael Museum in Lewes.\n\n\"Delaware continues to change and this is a snapshot of that change,\" Nasca said. \"Having our shared cultural heritage is very valuable and worthy of preservation.\"\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

Or would you like a Beluga to kiss you?\n\nIf you shouted, \"Yes, please,\" to both, then plan to visit Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut.\n\nMaybe you or your kids have a soft spot for Beluga whales, thanks to the children's song \"Baby Beluga\" by Raffi. Here's your chance to sing that song to a real, live Beluga. The Belugas who live at Mystic Aquarium are not babies, though a crowd favorite is the adolescent Juno, who is 16. But they all have those sweet, friendly, babyish faces.\n\nThe Beluga pool is one of the first things you'll see as you walk through the front gate.

The zoo is known for its historic architecture, which includes the country home of William Penn's grandson, and for its 42-acre Victorian garden, with animal sculptures and tree-lined walks.\n\nAbout 1,300 animals live at the Philadelphia Zoo, including endangered species such as Amur leopards and Western Lowland gorillas.\n\nIn 2018, the Philadelphia Zoo opened Penguin Point and Water Is Life, new exhibits that feature giant otters, red pandas and Humboldt penguins.\n\nWatch: Zoo key returns to Philly Zoo along with new dining options and LEGO installation\n\nSpecial Programs: \"Rock 'n' Roar\" brings lives bands to the zoo to perform children's music concerts at 10 a.m. Upcoming shows are July 27 and Aug. 3. \"Boo At The Zoo\" is a festival within the zoo every October, featuring several weekends of Halloween and autumnal fun.\n\nNearby Eats: Plan to stay at the zoo for your entire visit so that you don't miss anything.

Six Flags Great Adventure\n\nAmid all the roller-coasters and thrill rides, Safari Off-Road Adventure ride is a must-see attraction at the theme park, and the only way you'll get close to the animals who live there.\n\nThe ride lasts about 45 minutes, plus time spent at Camp Aventura, where the small animals live.\n\nOnce you're on the safari truck, you'll take a ride through the 350-acre preserve, with occasional off-road detours to splash through ponds, climb hills or venture over rugged terrain.

Many have interpretive signs along the trails so you can learn more about the site's lore or soak up nuggets of information while on a stroll.\n\nFor more routes, go to Delaware Greenways, which lists trails in all of Delaware's three counties. Another good site is All Trails, which can be found at alltrails.com\n\nThis free Sussex County coastal walking and biking trail starting in Lewes not only has great views but also has an interesting history. Junction & Breakwater Trail was named after a Pennsylvania Railroad line that ran between Lewes and Rehoboth in the mid-1800s. It delivered passengers to the Atlantic Coast resort areas but was abandoned in the 1970s. It was made into a trail in 2003.\n\nYou can start the trail at Gills Neck Road in Lewes, and it's about a 7-mile hike to Rehoboth. At the end of the trail in Rehoboth, you can wet your whistle at the Revolution Craft Brewing Co. (on a hot day, we liked the Sussex County Mule, a blonde ale with 5% ABV) or maybe even get a vegan carrot hotdog from the Silly Rabbit food cart that operates there occasionally.\n\nThe sites along the flat trail, a mix of crushed stone and asphalt trail, include native plants; wildlife; and the Salt Marsh, a coastal wetland that helps improve the water quality of bays and oceans. An 80-foot-long railroad bridge originally built in 1913 crosses Holland Glade stream.\n\nThe Lewes Library Trailhead, 111 Adams Ave., has bathrooms, water fountains, an informational kiosk, a bike station and plenty of parking. Parking also can be found about a quarter-mile from the trail's start on Gills Neck Road. There also are several places to rent bikes in Lewes if you prefer wheels instead of walking.\n\nWinterthur Museum founder Henry Francis du Pont's first love was gardening, and it certainly shows in the 1,000 acres of rolling hills, streams, meadows and forests of his former estate off Route 52 (Kennett Pike), between Greenville and Centreville.\n\nFirst things first: You need to pay admission ($20 to 22) or have a Winterthur membership ($30 to $1,000) to walk the 10 miles of roads and 25 miles of paths and walking trails. The trails are between a half-mile to almost 2 miles long. You'll need to wear an admission tag or display a membership card.\n\nBring your best friend:Dog-friendly places to take your best friend in Delaware\n\nYou can request a garden map at the Visitor Center or download a PDF of the Winterthur Estate Map. The map shows roads and paved paths as well as the locations of restrooms and emergency call boxes on the estate.\n\nTicketed guests can walk between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Members can walk daily from dawn to dusk. Keep your dog at home. No pets are allowed on the property.\n\nStill, many visitors say it's well worth the price because du Pont experimented with thousands of plants and he refined the color combinations that are the essence of the Winterthur Garden. Almost any time of the year, there is something new to see.\n\nAlthough Winterthur is a key part of Delaware’s history, there are no signs outside touting that the 175-room du Pont mansion, built in 1837, has the most significant collection of American decorative arts in the world. It has pieces dating back to 1640.\n\nHowever, there are trail markers on the grounds and interpretive signs along the walking paths in the 60-acre historic garden area; that content is focused primarily on Winterthur, du Pont and plant specifics.\n\nThe garden design preserves the look created by du Pont and his close friend and landscape architect Marian Coffin.\n\nPicnics are allowed and you can bring outside food and drink to the garden.\n\nHistoric New Castle is certainly the place to marinate yourself in what it was like to be in the First State back in the day.\n\nThe town, also known as Old New Castle, originally was named Fort Casimir when it was founded in 1651. Just 10 minutes south of downtown Wilmington, it is one of the most important Colonial/Federal villages in America — second only to Williamsburg, Virginia, in the number and authenticity of its historic structures.\n\nThe free, open-to-the-public 3.7-mile paved walking, hiking and biking trail in Battery Park, at the end of Delaware Street, runs along the Delaware River and offers views of waterfowl, ships and the Delaware Memorial Bridge.\n\nIn the summer, it's not unusual to see the Kalmar Nyckel, a replica of the 1638 tall ship that brought the settlers who founded little Fort Christina, later the city of Wilmington, at the public dock at 1 Delaware St. The tall ship frequently sails the Delaware River and will return to the Copeland Maritime Center campus at the Wilmington Riverfront shipyard in September.\n\nYou'll probably share the trail path with gaggles of geese (watch where you step!), and there's a nice mix of shade and sun. Picnic tables are located in some grassy areas, and benches are planted along the pathway for people watching. Views include rocky beaches and various jetties.\n\nAfter a hike, take a stroll on the cobblestone streets of the Colonial town and enjoy beverages and snacks at one of several restaurants including Jessop's Tavern, Nora Lee's and Zollies Jazz Cucina.\n\nTrail update:'Camp Fright' no more? Spooky 100-year-old Mill Creek-area site will get a new look\n\nFridays and Saturdays in October, the New Castle Historical Society hosts ghost-walking tours through the town. Visitors can stroll New Castle’s streets and alleyways and hear tales of hauntings, Victorian death and funeral customs, and crime and punishment that span the town's almost 370-year history. Tours begin at 7, 7:30 and 8:30 each night. Visit newcastlehistory.org for more information.\n\nThe 72-acre, New Castle County-owned park at 4651 Washington Street Extension in Penny Hill has a picnic grove, gardens, urban wildlife habitat, a pet-friendly parkland and paved trails linking to the Northern Delaware Greenway. It's free and open daily from dawn to dusk.\n\nOne of the park's best features is the 1.2-mile loop trail asphalt path that takes amblers by Rockwood Mansion, a retirement estate started in 1851 and completed in 1854 by wealthy Wilmington merchant baker Joseph Shipley while he was living in the village of Allerton, near Liverpool, England.\n\nShipley, a descendant of prominent Quakers, wanted the Victorian Gothic Revival mansion to be similar to Wyncote, his country estate in England. The gardens were designed to reflect his love of English architecture and landscape design. Shipley, a bachelor with no children, shared Rockwood with his unmarried sisters, Sarah and Hannah.\n\nMarkers on the property point out interesting details such as the house's conservatory, which had a hot-water heating system installed under the floor to keep Shipley's plants thriving in the winter. In the summer, all the plants were taken out to the garden.\n\nShipley died in 1867. After the death of the last sister, Hannah Shipley, in 1891, a great-nephew, Edward Bringhurst Jr., took over the estate. He and his family moved into Rockwood the next year and extensively redecorated the interior.\n\nAnother marker near the trail tells the story behind \"Edward's Playhouse.\" The ruin, near the walking path, was the surviving part of a farmhouse that had stood on the site when Shipley first purchased the land. In the 1890s, the Bringhurst family altered the structure and turned it into a playhouse for their youngest child, Edward, who died at the relatively young age of 55.\n\nVarious Bringhurst family members lived at Rockwood until 1972 when the estate, on the National Register of Historic Places, was donated to New Castle County.\n\nOf course, every old spooky-looking mansion has a ghost tale or two, including Rockwood. The house is said to be haunted by ghosts named Mary and Eddie, and in 2016 the mansion was featured on the SyFy TV show \"Ghost Hunters.\"\n\nThe museum is taking advantage of its spirits and will hold paranormal walking tours from 8 to 10 p.m. beginning Sept. 10. The Rockwood Paranormal Experience Team will lead visitors, 14 and older, through Rockwood’s gardens, fields and architecture using \"state-of-the-art' ghost-hunting equipment.\n\nThe cost is $35 for county residents and $45 for non-residents. Visit newcastlede.gov/431/Rockwood-Park-Museum\n\nOn several nights in October, Rockwood also will host 90-minute \"ghost story\" walks through the gardens that will be led by a character holding a lamplight known as a “Revisionist,” a person that can \"speak with the unliving.\" A cash bar and \"spooky\" concoctions will be available after each walk.\n\nIn 1935, Pamela and Lammot du Pont Copeland purchased more than 126 acres of land near the village of Mount Cuba near Hockessin where they built a Colonial-Revival style house and began planning formal gardens. In 1949, they brought in landscaper Marian Coffin to plan the formal gardens. She also worked with Henry Francis du Pont at Winterthur. The couple, like du Pont, were life-long gardeners. Lammot Copeland was a former president and chairman of the DuPont Co.\n\nThe Copelands envisioned the elegant gardens they cultivated on their estate would someday inspire a community of conservation.\n\nFlower power:Longwood Gardens travel guide: What you need to know if you go\n\nAfter the Copelands' deaths, Mt. Cuba eventually was opened to the public and began charging general admission in 2013. In 2018, Mt. Cuba Center's 582 acres merged with the 501 acres of the adjoining Red Clay Reservation. Mt. Cuba is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMt. Cuba Center at 3120 Barley Mill Road in Hockessin has more than 2 miles of trails throughout its more than 1,000 acres.\n\nThere are four short trails, each less than a mile, that can be visited now through Nov. 20. You will need to purchase a general garden admission ticket ($8 to $15) or have a membership ($84 to $182) to walk the trails.\n\nOnly service animals are permitted on the property. Not all the terrain is even. Golf cart transportation to select locations throughout the garden is available upon request, so are wheelchairs, walking sticks and a walker.\n\nThe scenic trails throughout Mt. Cuba Center’ are maintained in their more natural state and take on a “wilder” aesthetic, as opposed to the carefully curated gardens. You'll see native tree plantings and various species of plants and birds. New this year is the shaded \"Understory Trail\" that goes through a forest full of native hardwoods, across a stream, through a black walnut grove, by a pond as well as a low-lying meadow full of native wildflowers.\n\nMt. Cuba's garden and trails are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday. Tickets may be purchased in advance online or on-site at the Ticketing Office.\n\nIt's not exactly a secret, but The Laurels Preserve, a stunning, limited-use 700-plus acre preserve near Unionville, Pennsylvania, (not that far from the Delaware state line) is the kind of place that you have to know to know.\n\nThe Laurels Preserve has existing trails, roads and paths and it is open to members of the Brandywine Conservancy & Museum of Art every day from dawn to dusk. Visitors should carry their Brandywine membership cards. Membership ranges from $40 to $100.\n\nThe entrance to the Laurels is 100 yards off of Route 82 on Apple Grove Road, 4 miles west of Unionville, Pennsylvania. It feels exclusive because it has parking for only 10 cars about a quarter mile from the main gate.\n\nDogs are allowed, but they must be kept on a leash. If there are no open parking spots, the Brandywine Conservancy, which manages the land, asks that visitors not park on the grounds and return when a spot is available.\n\nNative Americans once fished the streams that are now called Buck and Doe runs, according to the conservancy. Millworkers harnessed the water for gristmills and a steel rolling mill during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For decades in the 20th century, the King Ranch grazed cattle in lush pastures adjacent to the streams.\n\nThe Conservancy created the Laurels Preserve, named for on-site mountain laurel trees, from 771 acres of donated land. The site has almost 500 acres of hardwood forest including mature red, black, white and chestnut oaks, tulip poplar, beech, white ash and hickory species.\n\nIt is also considered an important bird area by Audubon Pennsylvania, and about 160 species have been observed nesting in or migrating through the Laurels. It also has a variety of wildlife, including beavers and wild turkeys.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}]}
