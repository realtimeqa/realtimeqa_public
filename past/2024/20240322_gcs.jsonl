But with the bill’s passage by the House, the legislation could have better chances with the new balance of power in the Senate and support from the Biden administration.\n\n“There has been momentum that's been building,” said Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., who is among the legislation’s leading supporters.\n\nThe bill would make permanent a temporary ban on new mining in the region that the Obama administration put in place in 2012. The potential for that moratorium to be lifted, and the Trump administration’s recent efforts to boost uranium mining, make clear that without a ban, the Grand Canyon region would be vulnerable to new mining projects, Grijalva said.\n\n“That is a clear and imminent danger to the watershed, to the water source, the Colorado River and to the environment around the Grand Canyon,” Grijalva said. “And that's crystallized a lot of the opposition.”\n\nThe bill is strongly supported by tribes and environmental groups, who say prohibiting new mining claims on public lands surrounding Grand Canyon National Park would safeguard the drinking water of tribal communities and protect the Colorado River watershed.\n\n“It’s really a life and death situation for us,” said Matthew Putesoy, vice chair of the Havasupai Tribe. “We’re all depending on this water for our survival.”\n\nHe and other tribal leaders are concerned that mining in nearby areas could contaminate the groundwater aquifer, which supplies their drinking water and flows from springs that they consider sacred. If the aquifer were to be contaminated with uranium, Putesoy said, the Havasupai fear “it will seep right downriver and contaminate the village, and flow down further into the Colorado River.”\n\nUranium mines:Environmentalists fear more mining near Grand Canyon may be impending\n\nThe bill, called the Grand Canyon Protection Act, was passed as part of a package of legislation aimed at protecting wilderness and public lands. Other provisions include protecting nearly 1.5 million acres of public lands as wilderness and designating more than 1,000 miles of rivers as part of the nation’s Wild and Scenic Rivers. Supporters say those would be significant steps toward President Biden’s goal of conserving at least 30 percent of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030 to help address the climate crisis.\n\nThe House vote on the bill, with 227 in favor and 200 opposed, fell largely along party lines, with all but one Democrat supporting the measure and the vast majority of Republicans in opposition.\n\nRep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., noted that Grand Canyon National Park receives 6 million visitors a year and is the state’s symbol and the cornerstone of its tourism industry.\n\n“Though it’s special to all, it’s sacred to the Indigenous communities who call it home and who know better than anyone how critical it is to protect. It’s simple: This is no place for uranium mining,” Stanton said. “We can’t risk the health of the communities that rely on this land and water or the delicate ecosystems it contains.”\n\nArizona’s senators, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly, have introduced similar legislation in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans who spoke against the legislation included Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, who said there are no plans for mining in the Grand Canyon itself.\n\n“Proponents of the bill would have you believe that this is happening right near the Colorado River. In fact, there are already buffer zones in place. It’s called the Grand Canyon National Park,” Westerman said. “The only saving this bill will do is saving Chinese and Russian uranium mining jobs.”\n\nHe and other Republicans voiced concerns that the bill would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign sources of uranium and would prevent mining operations that would create jobs.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., called the bill “an open attack on Northern Arizona mining and the hard-working people of my district.”\n\nAs Grijalva encouraged members of Congress to support the bill, he pointed out that the Grand Canyon region contains less than 1% of known U.S. uranium reserves.\n\n“I think people have come to the realization that for less than one percent of domestic stock that would be found in and around the Grand Canyon relative to uranium, that it's not worth the risk,” Grijalva said.\n\nTribes have played a central role in pushing for the uranium mining ban. Leaders of the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe applauded the passage of the bill, as did the Hualapai Tribe and the Colorado River Indian Tribes. The legislation was also endorsed by the National Congress of American Indians, among other groups.\n\n“The backbone of this fight has been the Indigenous community in this country,” Grijalva said.\n\nHe pointed out that uranium mining decades ago left a toxic legacy on Navajo lands that has persisted to this day. Uranium mining on the Navajo Nation in the 1940s and 1950s littered the land with an estimated 1,200 mine sites, along with piles of hazardous waste.\n\nThe Havasupai Tribe has for years opposed a nearby uranium mine, the Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly called Canyon Mine, in the area of Red Butte. The mine, which wouldn’t be affected by the legislation, isn’t operating and hasn’t produced uranium since it was established in the 1980s. The tribe’s leaders say the mine is located on part of their ancestral lands, and they've voiced fears that the mine could contaminate the aquifer.\n\n“Red Butte is our birthplace,” Putesoy said. He said if mining were to “pierce the Earth there, we say they’re piercing the abdomen of our Mother Earth.”\n\n“If they mine there, they’re going to sever our umbilical cord, which ties us to the universe,\" Putesoy said. \"And that’ll have a devastating effect.”\n\nThere are about 600 existing uranium mining claims in the area covered by the legislation.\n\nThe conservation group Grand Canyon Trust said the House vote represents a key step for those who have fought for years to protect the watershed from the effects of uranium mining.\n\n“For decades, the Havasupai Tribe has led the charge to protect their homelands and their sole source of water from the inherent, deadly threats of uranium mining, which exposes otherwise stable deposits of uranium to oxygen and water, creating a risk that contamination finds its way into the human environment,” said Amber Reimondo, energy director of the Grand Canyon Trust.\n\nShe said if the legislation fails to become law and the area’s groundwater isn’t protected, “the lives and livelihoods of many will remain in the balance.”\n\nReach reporter Ian James at ian.james@arizonarepublic.com.

Its name comes from the Havasupai words baaj nwaavjo for “where Indigenous peoples roam,” and the Hopi words i’tah kukveny for “our ancestral footprints.”\n\nThe meeting brought together Republican members of the state's Senate and House committees on Natural Resources, Energy and Water and the House Committee on Land, Agriculture and Rural Affairs, who characterized the proposed monument as a federal land grab.\n\nMany officials mentioned the fact that more than 80% of the land in Arizona is already federally controlled and the new national monument would further decrease the already limited amount of private land in the state and in turn adversely impact Mohave County.\n\nThe lawmakers also expressed great concern about the national security impact from limiting our nation's uranium supply, which they said is vital for a clean energy future.\n\n\"Mining is self-sufficiency,\" Rep. Cory McGarr, R-Marana, said.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the environment, this doesn't have anything to do with cultural lands or anything like that,\" he said. \"Those are excuses that they're using to make sure we are beholden to other nations.\"\n\nThe elected officials also listened to more than two hours of public comment from a large mix of elected officials, residents, ranchers and business owners who almost exclusively opposed the creation of the monument.\n\nThe proposed move would create the state's 19th national monument encompassing 1.1 million acres including an area in the Kaibab National Forest to the south of the canyon, as well as two areas to the northwest along the Mohave-Coconino County line, and to the northeast adjacent to the Kaibab forest.\n\nWhile tribal and environmental advocates have long pushed for these protections, many leaders in the northwest part of the state argue that the move is an overreach by the federal government that encroaches on private ownership in the area and could harm industries like cattle ranching.\n\nMore on the monument:Biden to designate a new national monument on sacred tribal lands near the Grand Canyon\n\nMore than half of the land included in the proposed protections would be in Coconino County, which has supported the effort, but Mohave County Supervisor Travis Lingenfelter said 445,000 acres of it would be in his district west of the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau, most of which is rangeland.\n\nMultiple ranchers who attended the meeting spoke out against the monument including Mike Gannuscio, president of the Arizona Cattle Growers' Association. A representative from the Arizona Farm Bureau also spoke in opposition.\n\nThe federal government said no private land will be taken for the monument. However, during the meeting, rancher Chris Heaton presented maps that showed the proposed land monument would include property that his family has owned and worked on since before Arizona was a state.\n\n\"This is personal,\" Heaton said. \"They're coming after our ranches, our livelihoods, our jobs, our homes.\"\n\nHeaton said he was never contacted by anyone about the proposed monument in relation to his land.\n\n\"This is un-American,\" he said. \"We do not come after people's jobs and private property in this country.\"\n\nOfficials also took issue with the fact that while the U.S. Department of the Interior held a public comment session in Coconino County, they did not do the same in Mohave County.\n\n\"The fact that everybody was left out of this process is something that is extremely, extremely disappointing and concerning,\" Rep. Leo Biasiucci said.\n\n\"This is not how government works. Its about transparency, its about bringing everyone to the table and doing what's best for the community, period,\" he said.\n\nThere were only a select few residents who spoke in support of the new monument, citing the fear of uranium contamination in the water supply for nearby tribes, many of whom have been dealing with the adverse side effects of uranium mining for decades.\n\n\"This whole thing is just basically about letting the tribes have something back that they deserve,\" said Jack Ehrhardt, a resident who spent 13 years as the Planning and Economic Development Director for the Hualapai tribe.\n\nIt is unclear if any further action will be taken by state or local officials now that they've formally opposed the new national monument.\n\nRepublic reporter Brandon Loomis contributed to this article.\n\nReach the reporter at LLatch@gannett.com.\n\nThe Republic’s coverage of northern Arizona is funded, in part, with a grant from Report for America.

For over a decade, gold miners have been battling with the state government and conservationists in the Sierra Nevada Mountains concerned that modern-day mining practices damage the environment and should be scrutinized and regulated.\n\nSuction dredge mining, a practice in which individuals use vacuum-like devices to extract minerals from the bottom of waterways, has been restricted by a series of new laws passed in the California State Legislature. Earlier this year, miners’ rights groups were optimistic that a bill authored by Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula, would narrow the scope of the restrictions and allow them to apply for permits to return to rivers and streams with their suction dredge equipment once again.\n\nThe bill stalled before it reached a vote on the Senate floor, and now both its supporters and opponents are regrouping as the State Water Board prepares to introduce a permitting structure that could authorize suction dredging in California.\n\nNearly two centuries after 300,000 people rushed to California to search for gold, miners continue to make a living by selling the mineral, which goes for over $1,200 an ounce. Prospectors own about 40,000 federal claims to the minerals below public lands in California, a vestige of a gold-rush era policy that let people purchase property rights to the mineral deposits below ground.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK NEWS ALERTS: Message us here to get started\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMiners’ groups like the California-based American Miners’ Rights Association and the Western Mining Alliance, along with the Rural County Representatives of California, say California legislators have infringed upon their rights to mine for gold — a practice as old as the state itself. Environmentalist groups like the Sierra Fund and the Center for Biological Diversity say suction dredging contaminates California rivers and endangers plant and animal life living in them.\n\nBoth the state legislature and the courts have weighed in the potential environmental hazards of suction dredging. Since 2005, the State Senate and Assembly have passed eight bills amending the laws governing the practice — the Water Code and the Fish and Game Code, and the groups both in favor and against the practice have sued the state over the two codes nine times.\n\nSuction dredge miners use a device that dredges, or digs up, anywhere between several inches to several feet of the riverbed, then vacuum the loosened minerals into a “sluice box,” where valuable gold flakes and nuggets are sifted from unearthed bedrock.\n\nAlthough the practice is more common in Northern California, the Santa Ana River, which runs through parts of Southern California including Riverside and San Bernardino County, is a hotspot for miners as well.\n\nDredged gold is often mixed together, or amalgamated, with liquid mercury. To isolate the gold, the miners typically heat the compound until the mercury vaporizes, leaving behind pure gold.\n\nMore:Political outsiders want to split California in three, but local leaders are skeptical\n\nMore: Gold in the Castle Mountains\n\nMore:How the Colorado River's future could hinge on a little-known California election\n\nMiners and conservationists agree mercury threatens the environment but disagree over whether suction dredging stirs up the mercury and releases it into the water stream, or mitigates the dangers it poses by removing it from rivers, lakes, and streams altogether.\n\nIn the most recent environmental impact studies, scientists have presented evidence that the mercury unearthed by suction dredging escapes the miners’ machines, disperses into the water stream and leaves behind hazardous particles. The elemental mercury attaches itself to particles in the water, gets absorbed by bacteria that is then eaten by bugs that are then eaten by fish, which are then fished for human consumption.\n\nShannon Poe founded the American Miners’ Rights Association (AMRA) in 2012 hoping to educate the mining community about different mining practices and inform people of their rights and the debate happening in the state legislature.\n\nMiners like Poe are adamant that mercury methylation — the initial stage of the process — can only occur in warm waters and is not a problem in the mineral-rich cold-water environments where miners use suction dredge machinery. They worry government-funded research has predetermined biases, accuse legislators of misinterpreting the studies to match their agenda and cite studies of their own that suggest mineral extraction is beneficial to the environment.\n\n“Suction dredging cleans the environment,” Poe said. “It removes 98 percent of the mercury with the modern dredges that we use. It removes all the trash, the lead weights, the fish hooks.”\n\nPoe believes Democratic politicians and activists whose lives are drastically different than the lives of small-scale miners don’t understand the complexities of practices like suction dredging and oppose it on principle alone. “There’s people who just don’t want [suction dredge mining] to happen for ideological reasons,” he said.\n\nAMRA’s materials regularly refer the fact that Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), a leading voice against suction dredging, is from Hollywood, in an effort to highlight the cultural differences that separate politicians from the state’s urban enclaves from the marginalized rural communities many gold miners come from.\n\n“I don’t think Ben Allen had ever seen a suction dredge,” Poe said.\n\nIzzy Martin, the CEO of The Sierra Fund, an environmental group based in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, said the miners, not the legislators, were disregarding the latest research about mercury methylation. “It’s been very hard for the suction dredge miners to wrap their heads around this shift in understanding how mercury works. They talk about lead weights and fishing hooks. And, yes, lead weights and fishing hooks are a problem but they don’t dissolve into the water.”\n\nThis year, the miners found a sympathetic audience in Sen. Jeff Stone, an Inland Empire Republican who regularly clashes with Sacramento’s Democratic majority and, in his campaigns, promises to reduce taxes and shrink the size of government. After hearing miners’ rights groups make their case that government overreach infringed upon their way of life, Stone introduced SB 1222 to amend both the Fish and Game Code and the Water Code.\n\nBy proposing the bill, Stone asked his Senate colleagues to revisit SB 637, the 2015 bill authored by Allen that changed the laws governing suction-dredging in California by amending both the state’s Fish and Game Code and Water Code.\n\nIn passing SB 637, the legislature ruled that Water Board could prohibit the practice in certain areas and implement waste discharge requirements as part of a permitting process, which has neither been devised nor implemented yet, to the chagrin of the miners. Without a permitting process, nobody can suction dredge in California, even though lawmakers have yet to formally ban it.\n\nThe miners’ rights groups object to the way legislators changed the definition of suction dredging when they passed SB 637, which banned “the use of a mechanized or motorized system for removing or assisting in the removal of, or the processing of, material from the bed, bank, or channel of a river, stream, or lake in order to recover minerals.”\n\nThey claim the unclear language limits the use of more equipment than suction dredges alone, and say the sweeping restrictions are particularly unfair because they don’t correspond with the 2012 Environmental Impact Report cited in the bill, which only covered suction dredge machines.\n\nPoe, the miners’ rights founder, has fielded complaints from miners who have clashed with law enforcement over whether their use of motorized equipment for techniques other than suction dredging is limited by the Fish and Game Code amendments introduced by SB 637. He has also helped organize legal defense for miners who claim law enforcement officers patrolling national parks and other public lands throughout California are taking advantage of the law’s unclear language to interpret it overzealously.\n\nIn practice, the current law makes more than suction dredging illegal, Poe said.\n\n“It’s up to the interpretation by the law enforcement officers in the Department of Fish and Wildlife whether a sluice box is a suction dredge, or a truck is a suction dredge,” he said, naming two motorized machines miners use from the time they leave their homes to the time they extract gold from waterways.\n\nStone and the miners hoped SB 1222 would remedy these problems. Its proposed amendments to the Fish and Game Code included changing the definition of suction dredging to “the use of any equipment that removes minerals and water in conjunction to process and recover minerals” and narrowing its limitations on motorized equipment to any machine that “transports mineral-bearing material through a suction or nozzle.”\n\nIn a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water, Martin, The Sierra Fund’s CEO, warned legislators that, “The passage of SB 1222 would relax the protections laid out under SB 637 … thereby allowing certain types of mining practices (such as high banking) that threaten water quality.”\n\nShe acknowledges suction dredge mining remains a source of income and a way of life for many Californians but said the miners were clinging to the practice despite recent research on mercury methylation.\n\n“They’ve been caught in a shift in understanding how very, very dangerous mercury is,” she said.\n\nThe State Senate’s April decision to delay voting on SB 1222 granted neither side victory and left the fate of suction dredge mining in California unsettled until the State Water Board implements the suction dredge permitting structure SB 637 mandated.\n\nBut even though SB 1222 did not pass in the Senate, Poe still believes it was a success because it compelled Sen. Allen’s office and the Water Board to take action.\n\nSince, he has continued to organize his fellow miners and has regrouped to focus on the Water Board, which he says expects to introduce their permitting structure in Spring 2019. He feels optimistic that the Water Board, rather than the State Legislature, will lift California’s de facto ban on suction dredge mining and, by issuing permits, will help the mining community avoid conflict with law enforcement on public lands.\n\n“They had a one-year mandate to actually get this permitting process done. It’s been 2.5 years,” Poe said of the Senate and Water Board. “Because we shed light upon the vague language of SB 637 by bringing forward 1222, it’s kicked them in the behind and now they’re actually responding.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/fsu-news/2023/04/03/florida-state-officially-bans-tiktok-wechat-other-apps-from-its-campus/70077152007/", "title": "Florida State officially bans TikTok, WeChat other apps from its ...", "text": "Florida State University announced that social media apps such as TikTok have been immediately banned from campus, following a Florida Board of Governors statewide emergency regulation.\n\nFSU sent out a message to students, faculty and staff Monday afternoon to notify the campus community of all the social media platforms, websites and technologies that are blocked from being accessed on university devices or while using FSU’s Wi-Fi — TikTok, Tencent QQ, WeChat, Vkontakte, Kaspersky and Fizz.\n\nThe policy is in compliance with an emergency regulation adopted by the State University System Board of Governors on March 29.

The regulation states that landowners can register property on any land that is not officially demarcated as indigenous territory. But there are swaths of territory that are in the middle of the lengthy process to get officially demarcated as indigenous land, where private landowner have been able to lay claim.\n\n“The Normative Instruction 09, in essence, intends to provide legitimacy and allow the issuance of property titles for invaders of indigenous lands,” said the CIMI report.\n\nData shows that under Jair Bolsonaro's presidency, destruction of the world's largest rainforest has deepened. Paulo Lopes/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nBolsonaro has long argued that he is working to protect Brazil’s natural resources. In May, he signed an environmental protection decree to raise fines for illegal logging, fishing, burning, hunting, and deforestation. And during his presidency, Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) – a government agency that oversees policies related to indigenous communities – invested $16 million in surveillance of indigenous lands to combat illegal activities there.\n\nHowever, Bolsonaro has also called to develop indigenous lands, and said that the natural resources they contain should be put to use for the economic welfare of the country and indigenous groups.\n\nAccording to CIMI report, this set of actions – speech, norms and intention of modifying the constitution through a series of bills – gave invaders confidence to advance their illegal actions onto indigenous lands.\n\n“Illegal mining sites (garimpos) have now developed extensive infrastructure, invaders increased the deforestation of forest areas to open pastures and plant monocultures, and hunters, fishermen and loggers intensified their incursions into the territories,” the report added.\n\n“The indigenous cannot continue to be poor over a rich land,” Bolsonaro said in April 2019, estimating that their protected lands have “trillions of reais underground.”\n\nData from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) shows that under his presidency, destruction of the world’s largest rainforest has deepened, setting a new record in deforestation of the Amazon in the first half of 2022.\n\nAccording to data from INPE satellites, 3,750 square kilometers (1,448 square miles) were deforested between January 1 and June 24 – the largest area since 2016, when the institute began this type of monitoring.\n\nIn a response to CNN, the Environmental Ministry pointed to INPE data that shows deforestation on indigenous lands fell by 26.8% between 2019 and 2021. While accurate, these numbers ignore data from 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office. INPE data shows that between 2018 and 2019, deforestation in these same territories had nearly doubled.\n\nAccording to the CIMI report, the indigenous communities in Brazil most affected by illegal activity on protected lands were the Yanomami, Munduruku, Pataxó, Muras, Uru-eu-wau-waus, Karipuna, Chiquitanos, and Kadiwéus peoples.\n\n“We are not fighting over someone else’s property.

The new management zones are as follows:\n\nZone 1:\n\nAll portions of Benton, Marshall, Pontotoc, Tippah, and Union counties\n\nZone 2:\n\nAll portions of Panola County south of MS 315.\n\nZone 3:\n\nAll portions of Leflore County north of US 82\n\nAll portions of Tallahatchie County south of MS 32\n\nZone 4:\n\nAll portions of Warren County north of I-20 and west of US 61.\n\nAll portions of Sharkey and Issaquena counties west of US 61 and south of MS 14 and MS 16, excluding lands west of the Mississippi River main channel.\n\nThe new management zones include land surrounding locations where CWD-positive deer have been identified and restrictions within them remain the same in an effort to slow the spread of the disease which is fatal to cervids such as white-tailed deer and elk.\n\nHe was born in Mississippi:World mourns death of Mississippi alligator, WWII survivor rumored to have belonged to Hitler\n\nFact check:What you've heard about fish and game regulations may be wrong\n\nRestrictions and supplemental feeding\n\nSupplemental feeding, salt licks and mineral licks remain banned in the four management zones. In areas outside the management zones, but within the surveillance zones, hunters may resume supplemental feeding and the use of salt and mineral licks. However, deer carcasses may not be transported out of the surveillance zones except the following items:\n\nCut or wrapped meat\n\nDeboned meat\n\nHides with no head attached\n\nFinished taxidermy\n\nAntlers with no tissue attached\n\nCleaned skull plates (no brain tissue)\n\nCleaned skulls (no lymphoid or brain tissue)\n\nSome hunters within the management zones may be able to harvest more deer than the state bag limit under the Deer Management Assistance Program. According to Walsh, hunters within a 3-mile radius of a known CWD-positive deer may apply for DMAP-CWD tags.\n\nThe DMAP-CWD tags will allow hunters to harvest antlered and antlerless deer during any open deer season with no weapon restrictions. Hunters must apply for tags and tagged deer do not count against the hunters' bag limits. All deer harvested under the DMAP-CWD program must be submitted for CWD testing.\n\n\"It's an effort to reduce density so we can mitigate the spread of CWD,\" Walsh said. \"It will allow more flexibility to manage their property and supplemental feed if they so choose to.\"\n\nMandatory CWD testing\n\nOver the last year, 8,184 samples were submitted for testing, but MDWFP wants more to get a better understanding of the prevalence and spatial distribution of the disease in Mississippi. So, hunters in these areas will have mandatory testing on certain dates.\n\nMandatory CWD sampling is required of all deer harvested on November 21-22 in any county or portion thereof in the North Mississippi and Issaquena CWD management zones.\n\nMandatory CWD sampling is required of all deer harvested on January 2-3 in the following counties: all portions of Adams, Amite, Franklin, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lincoln, Pike, Walthall, and Wilkinson.\n\nMandatory CWD sampling is required of all deer harvested on January 16-17 in the following counties: all portions of Covington, Forrest, George, Greene, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Jefferson Davis, Jones, Lamar, Marion, Pearl River, Perry, Stone, and Wayne.\n\nWalsh said there will be additional check stations and freezers on the mandatory CWD sample submission dates to ease the burden on hunters.\n\n\"We will for sure have a freezer in every county,\" Walsh said. \"The actual physical check stations, we're still ironing out the details, but we know there will be a freezer in every county.\"\n\nPlease help support the work we do at the Clarion Ledger by subscribing.

The company hopes to complete the deal by September.\n\nTrump said Thursday he'll go through with the executive order banning TikTok here if no deal happens within 45 days.\n\nMeanwhile, parents might be wondering what exactly is the problem with TikTok?\n\nUnlike Facebook and Instagram, you're free to watch TikTok videos without registering, which means no data collection. However, if you want to create a video and share it, or comment on someone's video, then you must fork over your personal information, starting with age, phone number and e-mail address.\n\nFrom there, TikTok freely admits – in the privacy policy on its website – it collects information shared from third-party social network providers, and technical (your location) and behavioral information (what videos you think are funny, how often you watch) \"about your use of the Platform. We also collect information contained in the messages you send through our Platform and information from your phone book.\"\n\nThat's a lot.\n\nNorth says that because China has different privacy laws than here, she's wary about the app. \"I would say the same thing about any foreign app,\" she says. \"Angry Birds is from Finland. How are the privacy laws there?\"\n\nMight there be a ban on all apps from China? Besides TikTok, which has reaped over 800 million downloads and currently is the no. 5 most downloaded app on Apptopia's charts, WeChat, a WhatsApp like communication program, and QQ, which is also used for direct messages, are both owned by China's Tencent.\n\nIn a speech this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said all \"untrusted\" Chinese apps should be removed from U.S. app stores. “With parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat and others are significant threats to the personal data of American citizens,” not to mention tools for content censorship, Pompeo said.\n\nThe information collected by TikTok is similar to what's gathered by Facebook, but security researcher Patrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of security app Disconnect, says Facebook does more ill things with it, simply because it's so much bigger. Facebook boasts of over 2 billion users.\n\n\"The sheer volume of what's collected can't be compared,\" he says. \"What's bigger than using your data to influence an election, which Facebook did in 2016,\" with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he asks. That's when users data was tapped by Cambridge for political advertising.\n\n(This week Facebook introduced a TikTok clone for its Instagram app called Reels.)\n\nIn an April 2020 blog post, Tik Tok said it was doing everything it could to keep the U.S. data out of Chinese hands. \"Our goal is to minimize data access across regions so that, for example, employees in the APAC region, including China, would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US.\"\n\nBut there's a different between \"minimal\" and \"none.\"\n\nJackson suggests that parents counsel their kids that if they are to use TikTok, only use it to watch videos, so less data can be compiled on them. Additionally, users can opt to have their account be listed as \"private,\" and only select certain friends to gain viewing access.\n\nAnd North says that if the Microsoft deal goes through, she'll be happy to let her kids download the app.\n\n\"They own it, they have the data on U.S. servers and follow U.S. laws, and I'm fine with it,\" she says.\n\nMicrosoft has long been a company that focused on business, with Office 365 software and cloud computing. Online it owns LinkedIn, which fits in with its work-centric mantra, and Skype, which Microsoft tried to transition into more of a business communication device. \"Where they need help is with the next generation, young people,\" says North. \"This could get them there.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/watchdog-earth/2015/03/13/pnc-other-banks-back-away-from-mountaintop-removal-financing/70265720/", "title": "Banks stop financing mountaintop removal mining", "text": "James Bruggers\n\nOne more big bank has backed away from financing controversial mining practice known as mountaintop removal, prompting high-profile news coverage in the New York Times and on financial news websites.\n\nBut it remained unclear this week whether the decision by PNC on top of several other banks' earlier decisions, to stop all financing of mountaintop removal projects will have much affect in Eastern Kentucky, where mining has already been on the decline for a decade. (See update at bottom.)\n\nSemantics also comes into play.\n\nOnly a small percentage of surfacing mining in Eastern Kentucky meets the federal definition of mountaintop removal, even if that distinction may be lost on the general public. That's because there are other forms of surfacing mining that use dynamite to blow apart mountains to get at underground coal not technically considered MTR, under its federal definition.\n\nThe specific language of the PNC notice included in a recent corporate responsibility report spoke only of MTR, not surface mining in the mountains in general.\n\nStill, environmental advocates claimed a victory.\n\n\"We won! PNC officially changes their mountaintop removal policy,\" announced the Earth Quaker Action Team on its website:\n\nMountaintop removal has long been criticized for its negative environmental and health impacts. This process of getting coal from a mountain involves blowing up the top of the mountain and dumping the remains into rivers and valleys. The contaminants from the dynamite hang in the air and the sludge and residue from this process poisons water (2). Scientists note the impact of burning dirty coal is speeding up global climate change\n\nRainforest Action Network has also been involved in turning the banking industry against that mining method and called the PNC announcement a positive step.\n\nBill Bissett, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, downplayed the PNC announcement. He said less than 3 percent of eastern Kentucky coal mining qualifies as mountaintop removal, even though about half would be other forms of surface mining.\n\nAnd when it comes to challenges to Kentucky's coal industry, he said financing is not operator's main concern.\n\nThey have been focused on what they have called President Obama's war on coal, even as other factors such as higher mining costs, depleting reserves and competition from cheap natural gas have also suppressed the industry. And suppressed it is, with eastern Kentucky coal production dropping from 25 million tons to less than 10 million tons in the last decade.\n\nEastern Kentucky coal mining employment has been cut in half the last seven years, from about 14,000 to about 7,000, according to the state's latest numbers.\n\nFor its part, PNC included this language in its corporate responsibility report:\n\nDriven by environmental and health concerns, as well as our risk appetite, we introduced a mountaintop removal (MTR) financing policy in late 2010 and subsequently enhanced that policy in 2014. As a result, our MTR financing exposure has declined significantly and will continue to do so moving forward. Overall, PNC's exposure to firms participating in MTR represents less than one-quarter of 1 percent of PNC's total financing commitments. Under the policy, PNC will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to coal producers with 25 percent or more of their production coming from MTR mining\n\nBut a PNC spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to clarify what the company means by mountaintop removal mining.\n\nThe New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin explained the situation this way, noting other banks that have taken similar actions:\n\nPNC's decision comes after environmental advocacy groups put intense pressure on Wall Street banks to stop financing such practices. PNC had been a holdout; Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and others had already distanced themselves from coal companies involved in mountaintop removal. GE Capital and UBS appear to be the only large financial institutions in the country still willing to lend money to companies involved in this mountaintop mining, and even they are scrutinizing such activities.\n\nMatthew Armstead with EQAT was not sure whether the PNC financing ban would extend to other mountain surface mining. But he said that it's \" good to see that PNC Bank is now taking meaningful steps. Since this shift happened because of external pressure, it should be a wake-up call for everyone that the power of change lies with regular citizen activists.\"\n\nGeorge Lakey, a retired teacher who was arrested twice during the campaign, said at first PNC, \"didn't take us or this issue seriously. We showed them evidence, delivered them Appalachian water poisoned by mountaintop removal, and brought them face-to-face with residents hurt by this practice. We had to take direct action for them to see the light.\"\n\nUPDATE, 4:33 pm, Friday: a PNC spokeswoman tells me her company's policy only covers mountaintop removal mining as defined by the federal government. So that means tjhe vast majority of the blasting for coal in Kentucky's mountains won't be stopped by this decision.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2019/10/29/house-vote-bill-ban-uranium-mines-near-grand-canyon/2491600001", "title": "House votes to ban uranium mines near the Grand canyon", "text": "The U.S. House voted today to approve a bill that would prohibit new uranium mines on about 1 million acres around the Grand Canyon, making permanent a ban put in place in 2012. The vote of 236-185 was nearly all along party lines.\n\n\"For the Navajo people, this measure is more than just a political battle or a fight over differing views, it is a fight for life,\" said Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer in a statement provided to The Arizona Republic. \"It’s a fight to bring closure to a long and devastating history of uranium mining on the Navajo Nation.\"\n\n“While Americans are still holding the bag from the last time the government prioritized uranium mining, research has underscored the erratic nature of groundwater flow in this region,\" said Amber Reimondo, energy program director of the Grand Canyon Trust, which supports the bill. \"Uranium mining near the Grand Canyon amounts to little more than an unnecessary gamble of a sacred landscape, a worldwide wonder and a primary driver of the Northern Arizona economy.”\n\n\"Today's action by the U.S. House of Representatives is a big step forward,\" said Mike Quigley, Arizona state director for The Wilderness Society. \"Contamination from uranium mining poses a very real threat to local communities, critical water sources and one of our nation’s most treasured landscapes. We now look to the Senate to finish the job by passing permanent protection for the Grand Canyon region.\"\n\nSupporters of the measure, sponsored by Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., point to the poisonous legacy left by hundreds of old uranium mines in the Four Corners area. They also fear the region could suffer irreparable damage to environmental and cultural assets, including springs that drain into the Colorado River.\n\nOpponents of the bill say jobs are on the line for a region in need of economic development and they insist modern mining methods pose no threat to the Canyon, its water or other natural resources.\n\nDuring the morning's debate, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., attempted and failed to amend the bill.\n\nA procedural vote was held Tuesday to allow the House to vote on this and two other bills, one to create a no-fracking zone around Chaco Canyon Historic Park in New Mexico and one to set aside wilderness and recreational lands in Colorado.\n\nThe bill now moves to the Republican-controlled Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.\n\nEven if the bill reaches Trump's desk, it's unlikely he'll sign it, based on comments he made Oct. 23 on the White House web site announcing the implementation of polices to \"increase energy production and advance energy independence.\"\n\nThe uranium mining ban was first put in place in 2012 by then-Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. He issued an order withdrawing just over 1 million acres of public lands from new mining permits for 20 years to \"protect the Grand Canyon’s watershed from the adverse effects of extracting minerals.\"\n\nThe order did not affect existing mine permits, including the Canyon Mine, located southeast of Tusayan. That mine is currently being developed.\n\nThe withdrawal was meant to give the government time to conduct conclusive studies about the effects of uranium mining in the area. But in the seven years since the order, the U.S. Geological Survey, the agency charged with such research, hasn’t had adequate funding to study the issue, and according to the advocacy group Grand Canyon Trust, funding for further research has been cut.\n\nGrijalva’s bill, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act, would make the 2012 ban permanent. It’s his second attempt at legislating a permanent ban, in addition to filing a bill which would have created a national monument within the withdrawal area. The 2015 bill, the Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument Act, stalled in committee.\n\n“The Grand Canyon is at stake,” says Grijalva, who is also the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. “We have 40 million people, and their agriculture, industry, economies, all dependent on the Grand Canyon as a major water source.”\n\nThe Colorado River, a major source of surface water in the Southwest, carved the Canyon over billions of years, and it’s partially fed by seeps and springs along its course through the great chasm.\n\n“To be able to continue to have that resource available for the economic development of the regions that are involved, particularly Arizona, protecting the watershed is something we need to do,” Grijalva said.\n\nUranium draws attention from Trump, mining companies\n\nThe political landscape has changed since the 2012 ban was imposed. In 2018, the Interior Department, acting upon an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, officially listed uranium as a critical mineral, and the Commerce Department began researching the feasibility of imposing import quotas and domestic purchasing requirements on firms within the nation.\n\nDuring that same time, Canadian-American mining companies Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy filed what's known as a Section 232 petition with the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate if imported uranium from firms owned by foreign nations are a threat to national security.\n\nThe mining companies also asked the federal government to reserve 25% of all uranium purchases for U.S.-mined uranium, which has fluctuated in price and currently hovers at about $24 a pound.\n\nThe Commerce Department reported that such imports pose a risk since the U.S. imports 93% of all its commercial uranium, including 75% from just four countries: Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia and Russia.\n\nGRAND CANYON: Threats remain despite layers of protection\n\nTrump declined to impose import limits but did state concern over the possible security issues, and established a nuclear fuel working group to “reinvigorate the entire nuclear fuel supply chain,” which includes the means to enable more domestic nuclear fuel production.\n\nProtecting the Canyon and its surroundings\n\nAlthough Grand Canyon National Park itself is governed by layers of protective laws, policies and regulations, much of the land surrounding the park receives less protection. Most of it is managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, or is tribal or privately-owned land.\n\nTribes have their own environmental protection ordinances; the Navajo Nation, for example, banned uranium mining in 2005.\n\nThe leftover materials from uranium mines have been shown to be hazardous to human, animal and environmental health, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Radioactive dust from tailings can blow into towns and onto surface water. Groundwater can become contaminated from uranium leaching through rocks and sandstone to reach aquifers. And miners and residents living close to mines suffer from elevated rates of cancer, birth defects and other health ills.\n\nStudies conducted by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Piedmont Environmental Council find that in many areas affected by uranium contamination or mine closures, property values plummet. In some cases, most, if not all, residents move away, leaving behind modern-day ghost towns.\n\nAnd since some mine owners simply walk away from exhausted or closed mines, the taxpayer can end up footing the cleanup bill.\n\nWhat’s known about radiation from mine tailings\n\nResearchers still don’t know for certain how or if uranium can be mined safely in the land surrounding the Grand Canyon. However, researchers say that when uranium is mined where water is present, once the ore body is cracked open, it's exposed to oxygen and becomes highly soluble in water. The resultant radiation can be spread far and wide, including percolating into groundwater.\n\n“One tribal activist described uranium tailings as 'very sticky strawberry jam',\" that clings to everything, said Roger Clark, program director of the Grand Canyon Trust, which supports Grijalva's legislation.\n\nClark said there are many paths uranium and radium can travel that poison land, water and living things. Alpha and beta radiation is emitted from the ore. Uranium dust drifts on the wind, landing everywhere. Radon gas forms in underground mine shafts. Water can easily become contaminated, rendering it undrinkable.\n\nRadiation from tailings at the now-closed Orphan Mine below the South Rim of the Grand Canyon contaminated even the metal from old equipment, which had to be hauled away, said Clark.\n\nAnd even though the government has spent more than $15 million to clean up the site, hikers are warned against drinking water from Horn Creek and Salt Creek, both of which lie downstream from the mine along a popular backpacking route.\n\nEnvironmentalists fear that the Canyon’s 2,000-plus animal and plant species, some of which are threatened, endangered or endemic to the area, would be imperiled by contamination.\n\nTribes support the mining ban\n\nArizona and New Mexico tribes have also weighed in on Grijalva's bill. The Navajo Nation is dealing with the health and environmental fallout of more than 500 abandoned uranium mines.\n\n“I support Chairman Grijalva’s bill due to the long and devastating history of uranium mining that continues to cause contamination and health issues for many of our Navajo communities and people,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a statement. “The Navajo Nation already has a moratorium on uranium mining and transportation on our lands and we continue to uphold it for the protection of our people.”\n\nThe Havasupai Tribe, whose homeland is within the Grand Canyon, has long called for a ban on uranium mining within their ancestral lands.\n\n“We, the Havasu ‘Baaja (the people of Havasu, 'Place of the Blue-Green Water'), will be the ones who suffer the consequences of not knowing the science and now knowing the effects of uranium mining around the Grand Canyon,” the tribe said in a March 2019 resolution. “We have always lived in our canyon home and will always remain here, we cannot be relocated and remain Havasu ‘Baaja.”\n\nThe statement also notes that the Havasupai Tribe has opposed uranium mining in the region for more than 40 years.\n\nThe All Pueblo Council of Governors from New Mexico issued a statement on Oct. 20 opposing transport of high-level nuclear waste from storage sites across the U.S. to proposed semi-permanent sites in southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Several pueblos are also dealing with the toxic legacy of closed and abandoned uranium mines.\n\nOpponents say modern mining is safer\n\nOpponents said Grijalva's bill is an unnecessary attack on the mining industry and the northern Arizona economy.\n\n“This is yet another attempt by Chairman Grijalva to deceive people into believing that modern mining poses a health and safety risk to the American people,” said Rep. Paul Gosar, R.-Ariz., in a statement. “Environmental impact statements have shown that mining in the Arizona Strip poses no risk to water sources, recreation, or the Grand Canyon.”\n\nMohave County Supervisor Gary Watson, who's noted for his support of increased economic development in the northwestern corner of Arizona, testified against Grijalva's national monument proposal in 2016.\n\n\"The Federal Government should be charged with managing its public land to the benefit and in the best interest of the County and State, our residents and guests,\" Watson said in a submitted statement. \"Mohave County is constantly fighting to stop the federal government from establishing more monuments, closing off public access, restricting hunting and fishing and limiting mineral development, ranching and logging, in their attempt to implement the misguided agendas of extremist environmental groups.\"\n\nFellow Supervisor Buster Johnson said modern mining technologies pose no threat to people or the environment.\n\n\"It's the security of the nation that bothers me,\" he said. \"It's critical to the continued defense of our country. We need uranium set aside for the military, for the medical industry.\"\n\nJohnson said a uranium mill in Blanding, Utah, run by Energy Fuels, takes spent radioactive material from local hospitals and reprocesses it for further use. And, he said, \"any new mine operations must be approved and backed by financial surety that reclamation is completed at the end of the mine's life.\"\n\nGosar added that he supports preserving what he calls “the most iconic landmark in Arizona and one of the most iconic in the world.” But, he added, “it’s particularly disgusting that Chairman Grijalva is disguising his effort to cripple America’s mining industry as an effort to protect the Grand Canyon.”\n\nRecreation and tourism drive economy, group says\n\nThe Grand Canyon Trust released a white paper in January that rebutted Gosar’s assertion that mining jobs are key to the region's economic health. In the report, researchers said outdoor recreation and tourism are the real drivers.\n\nMore than 9,000 jobs and $938 million in annual receipts are generated annually for the region, and some $160 million flows into state and local government coffers.\n\nGrijalva said he’s interested in protecting the region’s cultural assets and health, which also supports the tourism industry, as well as the health of the people.\n\n“I did a forum three weeks ago in Window Rock in which miners' families came to talk about the effects and environment and the environmental effects of contaminated land,” he said.\n\nNez said Grijalva “heard testimony directly from former uranium mine workers, health professionals, and tribal leaders, so he is very knowledgeable about the devastating impacts that such mining has.”\n\nThe bill's supporters say polls show strong public support to continue the ban. Many people supported the withdrawal during public hearings. And a 2018 poll found that 65% of Arizonans, both Democrats and Republicans, support continuing the mining ban.\n\n“I think for Sen. Martha McSally, for her opponent, Mark Kelly, or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema who hasn't taken a position on it yet, this is going to be a tough vote to dodge,” said Grijalva.\n\nKelly, a Democrat who is running against Republican McSally for the Senate next year, provided a statement about the bill, which he supports: “The Grand Canyon is a treasure not just for Arizona, but for the planet, and we should continue to protect this area from uranium mining,” he said. “Northern Arizona is still contending with the public health impact of abandoned uranium mines, and the federal government should be focused on cleaning up those sites.”\n\nMcSally did not return a request for comment on the bill, nor did Gov. Doug Ducey. “Kyrsten is continuing bipartisan discussions and meetings with local stakeholders on how best to move forward,” said a spokesperson for Sinema via email.\n\n“I think we'll have public opinion (for the bill),” Grijalva said. “We're fighting for public interests, not for private interests.”\n\nThis article has been updated to more clearly explain how uranium ore can pollute water and land.\n\nReach the reporter at debra.krol@AZCentral.com or at 602-444-8490.

Dr. Scott Harris, head of the Alabama Department of Public Health, said it takes five or six weeks for someone to gain the maximum amount of immunity after the initial vaccine in a two-shot process. That means time is nearly up for people to start the vaccination process and have “the safest possible Thanksgiving,” he said. Harris said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays won’t be as deadly as last year because of vaccinations and the large number of people who have antibodies after contracting COVID-19, but there are no guarantees. “We just don’t know,” he said. While statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that more than 2.6 million people in Alabama have gotten at least one vaccination, only 2.1 million residents, or 43% of the state’s population, are fully vaccinated – among the worst rates in the nation. More than 14,700 people have died of COVID-19 in Alabama, giving the state the fourth-worst death rate nationally, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck off the coast early Monday in what the Alaska Earthquake Center called an aftershock of an 8.2 quake from late July. Monday’s earthquake was felt throughout the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. It occurred about 70 miles east of Chignik, a community of about 90 people on the Alaska Peninsula. Chignik is about 450 miles southwest of Anchorage and 260 miles southwest of Kodiak. The center had not received reports of significant damage but also relies on self-reporting, said seismologist Natalia Ruppert. Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for Alaska’s emergency management office, said the office was contacting communities and had no reports of damage so far. The U.S. Geological Survey on Twitter had reported a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 that was later revised to 6.9, which ties another earthquake that hit Alaska in August. The two 6.9 quakes were the largest aftershocks tallied since the United States experienced its largest earthquake in the past half-century, the magnitude 8.2 quake that struck south of the Alaska Peninsula on July 28. It was widely felt but caused no major damage in the sparsely populated region closest to it.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Opponents of a nearly seven-year-long process to exchange Oak Flat, a 2,200-acre site in Tonto National Forest, to a copper mining company cheered to learn that a recent survey found 74% of likely Arizona voters do not approve of the mine. And a new report has revealed the mine would use enough water to supply a city of 140,000 annually for its estimated life. Legislation to repeal the land deal has been pushed forward, and a lawsuit filed in January will be heard in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals this month. To obtain the ore, Resolution Copper plans to use a method known as block cave mining. Eventually, the ground under Oak Flat would subside, leaving behind a crater about 1,000 feet deep and nearly 2 miles across. Opponents also fear underground water channels and major aquifers might be damaged or destroyed. Oak Flat is a sacred site to Western Apaches and holds great cultural significance for other tribes in the region. Known to the Apaches as Chi’chil Bildagoteel, Oak Flat had been withdrawn from mining claims since the Eisenhower administration. To boot, it’s one of Arizona’s rare riparian habitats, providing water and shelter for animals, birds and plants, including the Emory oak, a staple in Apache peoples’ diets for centuries. And the area is popular with recreationists.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city violated state law with its removal last year of a historical display that included a Confederate flag, a judge ruled. In an order filed last week, Sebastian County Circuit Judge Gunner DeLay found that the city is in violation of the Arkansas State Capitol and Historical Monument Protection Act, which didn’t take effect until April of this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. DeLay found that the flags and bronze markers that were removed from Riverfront Park in April 2020 are a “historical monument” even though they are no longer displayed. The display was put up in 2001 and also included the French flag and old 15-star and 20-star American flags, among others. This June, attorney Joey McCutchen filed a lawsuit alleging the city violated the new state law by not replacing the display or obtaining a waiver from the Arkansas History Commission. An email exchange in June 2020 among City Administrator Carl Geffken and other officials indicated the flags were initially removed because they were tattered and needed to be replaced. Geffken wrote that he and others discussed changing the flags flown at the park after the May 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. He also said his decision to remove the flags would maintain “a piece of history from potential harm.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: A Southern California beach that was closed more than a week ago because of a leak of crude oil from an undersea pipeline reopened Monday, far sooner than many expected. Huntington Beach’s city and state beaches reopened after officials said water quality tests revealed no detectable levels of oil-associated toxins in the ocean water. Early Monday morning, surfers bobbed in the waves, and people walked along the shoreline, some with dogs jumping and playing in the water. Andrew Boyack, a 54-year-old commercial photographer, was eager to get back to surfing the waves he usually rides three or four times a week. “There’s lots of guys out, so I figure it’s probably all right, and I guess they tested it,” he said while rinsing off at an outdoor beach shower. Huntington Beach and nearby coastal communities reeled from last week’s spill that officials said sent at least about 25,000 gallons and no more than 132,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. It was caused by a leak about 5 miles off the coast in a pipeline owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy that shuttles crude from offshore oil platforms to the coast. The cause is under investigation, and officials said they believe the pipeline was likely damaged by a ship’s anchor several months to a year before it ruptured. It remains unknown when the slender, 13-inch crack in the pipeline began leaking oil.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Body camera footage released Friday in the case of a police officer accused of using a chokehold during an arrest shows him putting his arm around a man’s neck and holding it there for about 10 seconds shortly after handcuffing him. While holding the standing man around his neck during the June 7 arrest at a city building in Greeley, Officer Kenneth Amick accused him of trying to grab the officer’s hands. The man denied it, his voice distorted, while still in the hold. Amick released the chokehold after another officer stepped toward them and said: “Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.” A judge ordered the release of the video Thursday, siding with a coalition of news media. The coalition argued that it should be released under a Colorado law enacted this year in response to nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. It generally requires that footage be made public, upon request, when a complaint is lodged against a police officer. Amick, charged with second-degree assault, is scheduled to enter a plea Oct. 22. Weld County District Court Judge Vincente Geraldo Vigil had earlier blocked the release of footage after Amick and prosecutors argued it could prejudice a potential jury. On Thursday, he ruled such concerns can be dealt with during jury selection, KDVR-TV reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Online gambling is coming to the state, on a limited basis. A “soft launch” beginning Tuesday will allow several hundred people to open accounts to wager for a seven-day period. The state marked the first day of its long-awaited rollout of legalized sports and internet wagering Sept. 30, when Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods held events to mark the grand opening of temporary sports betting venues. In addition to the two tribal casinos, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, the state’s quasi-public lottery, will offer online sports wagering and retail sports betting at 15 locations. The soft launch allows people to gamble using their phones, tablets and other online devices. Once the launch is completed, online gambling will be available statewide. “After more than a decade of advocacy and negotiation, statewide sports betting and iGaming is finally coming to Connecticut,” Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, told the Hartford Courant. ”We’ve made it to the finish line, and we’re excited to finally launch.” The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, which operates Foxwood, has partnered with DraftKings Inc., and Mohegan Sun, operated by the Mohegan tribe, has partnered with FanDuel. The lottery’s partner is Rush Street Interactive.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The University of Delaware is bringing to fruition its plans to develop a science and technology-focused campus at the sprawling former Chrysler plant in the city. The university on Thursday officially opened the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, a six-story, 220,000-square-foot building designed to bring together UD students, researchers and industry workers focused on “life-saving medicines and transformational treatments.” It’s one of a series of buildings to open or break ground amid the COVID-19 pandemic at what’s now the UD Science, Technology and Advanced Research Campus. The new innovation center – nicknamed AP BIO by officials – is among the most advanced UD facilities. Charles Riordan, UD’s vice president of research, scholarship and innovation, called it “the most interdisciplinary building” in the school’s history. It houses the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals, a federally sponsored private-public partnership that aims to accelerate biopharmaceutical innovation; the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, a support and research group formed by Delaware’s research organizations; the university’s department of biomedical engineering; and research laboratories in pharmaceutical discovery and molecular and medical sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new bike path is in the works for the National Mall, WUSA-TV reports. This week, the D.C. Department of Transportation, in partnership with the National Park Service, will begin implementing safety improvements on 15th Street, including two-way protected lane for bicyclists. “This project will improve pedestrian safety for visitors to the National Mall and create a north-south bicycle connection between the White House, National Mall and the Jefferson Memorial,” Mike Litterst, chief of communications and spokesperson for the National Mall and Memorial Park, said in a release. NPS said it will install an additional projected lane on East Basin Drive Southwest next spring that will connect with the multiuse trail on the 14th Street bridge. Construction on 15th Street will last through the fall and involve temporary lane closures for drivers. When the work is complete, there will be three lanes open to drivers on 15th Street – one southbound and two northbound. Pedestrians and bicyclists can continue to use the sidewalks along 15th Street until the project is complete, but they should expect a limited number of disruptions due to construction activity.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The activist who led a movement to allow most former felons in Florida to vote has gotten more of his own civil rights restored under a new state clemency program. Desmond Meade, head of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, announced in a Twitter video Saturday that he can now run for office, serve on a jury and take the bar exam to become a lawyer. Meade has a law degree from Florida International University. “This is good,” Meade said on the video. “The restoration of my civil rights definitely helped remove some hurdles for me.” Meade, 54, was a leader in the successful 2018 effort to enact a voter-approved constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons whose sentences are complete. The GOP-led Legislature later passed a measure requiring all financial obligations such as fines to also be completed, which critics said primarily disenfranchises minorities and poor people. Meade, who served time for drug and firearms offenses, already had regained the right to vote. The other rights were automatically restored under a policy adopted in March by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. Meade last month was awarded a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” of $625,000 in recognition of his work. He said it will be used to pay off law school loans and continue his work for people convicted of felonies.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: City officials say bars and restaurants are toasting a successful trial run at serving to-go orders of beer and cocktails in aluminum cups. Georgia’s oldest city recently ended a two-month pilot aimed at seeing whether businesses can reduce their use of plastic cups by switching to aluminum ones that people can reuse or recycle. Sipping from to-go cups of alcohol on the streets of the downtown historic district has long been a part of Savannah’s bustling nightlife. City Alderman Nick Palumbo pushed for the trial to let businesses test the aluminum cups. The City Council agreed to temporarily add aluminum alongside paper and plastic cups allowed for serving to-go drinks during the pilot period. Bars and restaurants ended up using about 50,000 aluminum cups. “We know that diverted 50,000 pieces of plastic out of the waste stream, out of our environment, which is just a huge hit,” Palumbo said. Carey Ferrara of the Gaslight Group, which owns several Savannah restaurants, agreed the pilot was successful. She said the biggest downside is that the aluminum cups cost at least four times more than plastic. She said businesses might be able to reduce the extra cost by combining their orders. “We can work together to purchase the cups in a quantity to make the price low enough for us,” Ferrara said.\n\nHawaii\n\nNaalehu: Two strong earthquakes struck off the coast of the Big Island on Sunday, rattling residents and causing items to fall off shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake had a magnitude of 6.1 and struck about 17 miles south of Naalehu. The agency said a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 20 minutes later in the same area. The National Weather Service in Honolulu said there was no tsunami threat. At a gas station in Naalehu, the refrigerator display doors were opened by the shaking, and items fell to the ground. No injuries were immediately reported. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said there was no damage from the earthquake at airport runways, commercial harbors or highway bridges.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Press Club has dropped its request that a judge hold Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin in contempt of court for refusing to turn over public records related to her education task force. Attorneys for the state press association and the lieutenant governor’s office filed the agreement to drop the contempt request Friday afternoon, according to court documents. McGeachin and her chief of staff, Jordan Watters, have repeatedly ignored requests for comment from the Associated Press. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. The task force was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system, something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” The lieutenant governor lost the lawsuit, and Fourth District Judge Steven Hippler ordered her to release the documents. But McGeachin didn’t immediately release the materials, and a few weeks after Hippler’s ruling she formally asked the judge to reconsider the matter. Her office finally released the records shortly after the Idaho Press Club asked the judge to hold McGeachin in contempt of court.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Old State Capitol has reopened to visitors after interior renovations were completed. Visitors will see a new feature, an education gallery and video room. Exterior work on the dome of the building continues, but indoor plaster work and painting is finished, allowing the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to open for tours Thursday. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. The building served as Illinois’ Capitol from 1840 to 1876. Abraham Lincoln served in the Legislature there and in 1858, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, delivered his famous “House Divided” speech in the Hall of Representatives. When work began in March, officials indicated the building would only be closed through April. But officials said the project met with unforeseen delays, according to historic sites superintendent Justin Blandford. Combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, the reopening was delayed. The $1.5 million project, under the management of the Illinois Capital Development Board, involves installing a new roof on the drum that supports the dome and restoration of the drum’s columns and windows. Work on the outside of the dome is marked by the construction scaffolding that surrounds it.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Former Vice President Mike Pence climbed on horseback during a ride by a veterans group trying to reduce suicides among military veterans. Pence joined members of the nonprofit organization BraveHearts for a Saturday ride in Fort Wayne aimed at raising awareness about the suicide issue. The national group uses the riding and care of horses in therapy for veterans suffering with depression or other emotional troubles. Pence rode for part of the route, talked and posed for photos with residents and riders, and spoke during a ceremony at the ride’s conclusion. The former Indiana governor said he was inspired by the group’s recognition that some veterans have wounds “that can’t be seen with the human eye.” “They are the burden of the heart and the mind that over generations in America that have really gone unspoken of,” Pence said. “But I’m proud to say now we’re recognizing as a nation the unseen injuries of our heroes.” About 30 horses and riders followed the full 20-mile route through Fort Wayne – a distance referring to the estimated 20 veterans a day who die from suicide.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Debates over COVID-19 mitigation strategies and how race should be discussed in classrooms are fueling frenetic energy around suburban school board races. A wave of conservative candidates and their supporters are urging their neighbors to take their frustrations to the polls. Although the races are nonpartisan in Iowa – party ID doesn’t appear on the ballot – they’re gaining attention from Republican leaders at both the state and national levels. In Waukee, a slate of parents backed by the local Republican Party is warning about “harmful ideology” in schools. In Southeast Polk, a candidate hosted an event for parents to get their mask mandate exemption forms notarized. And in Ankeny, a school board candidate who inspired the state’s law prohibiting mask mandates in schools has the endorsement of Gov. Kim Reynolds. Their platforms are part of a nationwide backlash from the defining events of 2020: the coronavirus pandemic and the rise of attention on racial justice issues after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who was choked to death by a white police officer. The rancor has risen to such a level across the country that a nonprofit that represents school boards has asked federal officials to step in to protect elected officials and school leaders from physical violence.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A major water line break that forced residents to boil their water before using it for several days highlights concerns about aging infrastructure in the state’s largest city. The water main break that forced the boil order last week happened after the city’s water plant lost part of its power supply, so the pumps sending water throughout the system automatically shut down. The boil order was lifted for Wichita on Saturday. “That was an abrupt shutdown,” Director of Public Works and Utilities Alan King said. “When we brought the pressure back up and to pressurize the system, that was a rapid decrease in pressure (followed by) a rapid increase in pressure, and both of those are not friendly to pipes, especially older pipes.” The Wichita Eagle reports that a 2017 assessment found 99% of the city’s water treatment plant was in poor condition, and the entire raw water pipe system was in very poor condition. Recent reports have said Wichita’s water supply needs hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and near-constant repair and replacement. The city is aware of the fragile state of its water supply and has budgeted $10 million a year in its most recent capital improvements plan for repairs, replacements and maintenance of distribution lines. A new water plant under construction won’t be ready until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nKentucky\n\nRadcliff: It was no small feat, but now a local landmark is part of the Guinness Book of World Records. What started as a sharp idea in 2017 has turned into a crowning moment for Red Hill Cutlery and its owners, Lonnie, Jason and Josh Basham. The company has received confirmation that it does indeed own the world’s largest pocketknife at 34 feet, 6 inches. The business will hold a formal celebration this week. “It means a lot for us,” Jason Basham said. “It gives us an identity that sets us apart from any other knife store of its kind.” The idea started when the family began building a new location for Red Hill Cutlery and its American Pocketknife Museum in Radcliff. They gathered inspiration from a Barlow pattern pocketknife in Lonnie Basham’s personal collection. Josh Basham said the pattern has been interwoven with American history dating back to the 1600s. “The Barlow goes back to Huckleberry Finn,” he said. “You can go back in history, and the Barlow was one of the most notorious knives carried by U.S. presidents.” The world’s largest pocketknife is held open by a single pin, Lonnie Basham said. “We could pull out that one pin and it would close, but it would take a crane to do it because it’s so heavy,” he said. A community event acknowledging the Guinness recognition is set for 1 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city hopes a temporary shift to once-weekly garbage collections will help address the piles of trash and debris that have piled up along streets across much of New Orleans. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration announced the change to its solid waste collection Saturday as a way to bring a level of consistency to residents. “We are collectively beginning to see the progress on the ground, but it’s time to bring some predictability so that our residents can better prepare for their trash collection,” Director of Sanitation Matt Torri said in a statement. The city’s two primary solid waste contractors, Metro Service Group and Richard’s Disposal, are supposed to collect garbage twice a week, but they have fallen behind throughout the year primarily because of staffing shortages brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. After Hurricane Ida, the situation worsened. Torri said the shift to once-weekly pickup is “temporary,” but the administration is not committing to any collection schedule in the future. Cantrell announced Sept. 23 that she had hired four emergency contractors to clear out the backlog while Metro and Richard’s resumed regular collections. That effort is expected to last a month and cost and estimated $20 million to $30 million, The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Prices for the state’s most beloved export are much higher than typical right now because of high demand and the possibility that those who catch lobsters are having a slower season. Maine lobsters usually become less expensive over the course of the summer because of the increase in catch off the state’s coast. But this year, wholesale prices that typically fall to the $8 or $9 per pound range never fell below $10.50. And they’ve soared even higher in early fall, eclipsing recent records and causing consumers to fork over more money at seafood counters. Members of the industry said interest in lobster from food processing companies and international buyers is driving heavy demand for the crustaceans. Meanwhile, the fishing season might be slightly off the pace of recent years, so supply is stretched thin, they said. “The season has been maybe a little bit below average, but the price has been pretty decent, so I think we’re going to be OK,” said Kristan Porter, a lobster fisherman and president of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association. America’s lobster industry, based mostly in Maine, goes through pricing ebbs and flows over the course of a typical year. Lobsters are typically heavily fished in summer, when they shed their shells and many reach legal size.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lumped into the “Other” racial and ethnic category, American Indians and Alaska Natives are effectively invisible on the state’s COVID-19 website. More than 120,000 people who identify as Native American live in Maryland, but without public-facing numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is a mystery how many the disease has affected – and how many resources should be allocated to help them. “Not only is that bad public health, but it’s also very dehumanizing for American Indians and Alaska Natives on our native lands,” Kerry Hawk Lessard, executive director of the health services nonprofit Native American Lifelines of Baltimore, told Capital News Service. The Maryland Department of Health puts American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” category for COVID-19 cases and death numbers “due to low statistical occurrence given the population of Native Americans in the state,” department spokesperson Andy Owen wrote in an email to Capital News Service. However, American Indians and Alaska Natives are at the highest risk for death and hospitalization from COVID-19 among all races and ethnicities, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There is no regulation that requires this manner of reporting,” Owen wrote.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Kenya’s Benson Kipruto won the pandemic-delayed Boston Marathon on Monday when the race returned from a 30-month absence with a smaller, socially distanced feel and moved from the spring for the first time in its 125-year history. Although organizers put runners through COVID-19 protocols and asked spectators to keep their distance, large crowds lined the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston as an early drizzle cleared and temperatures rose to the low 60s for a beautiful fall day. They watched Kipruto run away from the lead pack as it turned onto Beacon Street with about 3 miles to go, and he broke the tape in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 51 seconds. Diana Kipyogei won the women’s race to complete the eighth Kenyan sweep since 2000. Marcel Hug of Switzerland won the men’s wheelchair race earlier despite making a wrong term in the final mile, finishing the slightly detoured route just seven seconds off his course record in 1:08:11. Manuela Schar, also from Switzerland, won the women’s wheelchair race in 1:35:21. Hug, who has raced Boston eight times and has five victories here, cost himself a $50,000 course record bonus when he missed the second-to-last turn, following the lead vehicle instead of turning from Commonwealth Avenue onto Hereford Street.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: One of the city’s most iconic landmarks, a site familiar to music lovers around the world, is gearing up for a dramatic new look. The Motown Museum has unveiled renderings that depict a crisp, lush, bustling outdoor plaza at Hitsville U.S.A. Officials say they’re aiming to create a welcoming hangout for visitors, inspired by the days when artists and fans strode Motown’s front lawn in search of musical opportunity and glory. And they want to foster a Motown experience before guests even step through the doors. The space, part of the museum’s ongoing $55 million expansion, will be a mix of hardscapes and softscapes: The plaza will be tiled with granite pavers and adorned with benches, flower beds and foliage, including a new line of trees on the property’s west side. A new surround-sound system will envelop visitors in Motown songs as they step onto the grounds, while the space will be bathed in light at night. A permanent stage will host scheduled performances and pop-up music sets, helping address one of the most common questions from tourists in Detroit: “Where can I go to hear Motown music?” The front-yard transformation, now underway and scheduled for completion next summer, is the second of three construction phases in the museum’s expansion project, launched in 2016.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state imposed an emergency order Monday blocking importation and movement of deer into and within the state to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease from deer farms and protect the state’s wild deer herd. “This disease poses a clear, immediate and serious threat to Minnesota’s wild deer, and these actions reflect what’s at stake,” Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a news release. The decision came after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last month that a Wisconsin deer farm where the disease was detected sold nearly 400 deer to 40 farms across seven states in the past five years. The Minnesota DNR said it learned Sept. 27 that Minnesota farms received five deer from the Wisconsin farm. A farm in Stillwater received two of the deer in 2016. That farm has since closed, and the deer were shipped back to Wisconsin in 2019. The other three deer went to a farm in Clear Lake in 2017. That farm is active but under quarantine. Regulators have yet to approve a live test for CWD, which is similar to mad cow disease. It attacks deer’s brains, causing them to act strangely, lose weight and die. It’s always fatal to deer or elk. It’s caused by an abnormal proteins, prions, that can persist in the environment and spread to other deer.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Child care providers are complaining that they are being forced to endure financial hardships, with some even being forced to close their doors, because of the challenge of accessing federal funds through the Mississippi Department of Human Services. Deloris Suel, president of the Child Care Directors Network Alliance, told WLBT-TV the state has failed to distribute half a billion dollars in federal money meant to help support child care providers from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act. Bob Anderson, executive director for the Department of Human Services, told the television station the agency is not sitting on federal child care money, but officials want to distribute the funds “responsibly, prudently and carefully” and within the parameters of state and federal guidelines. Anderson said the state will be reviewed and audited for every dollar that is awarded. Anderson said that during the pandemic, the state provided thousands of dollars of cash grants to child care providers, and it’s still waiting for hundreds to provide documentation on how the funding was spent. Suel said many child care providers don’t understand the process because it is too complicated and filled with barriers. She said a lot of providers are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Elected officials have voted to remove two courthouse murals that show a white man pointing a gun at a Native American man and an attempted lynching. The Boone County Commission made the decision Thursday after lawyers raised concerns. The murals, painted by Sidney Larson in 1994, will be placed in storage. The murals depict multiple scenes from Columbia’s history, including when Southern guerrillas terrorized Union loyalists in 1864. Another scene shows a white man being punished for stealing a cow. Three shirtless Black men also are shown chained by their ankles as they carry a plank. The majority of those who spoke at a public hearing late last month were in favor of the murals’ removal from the courthouse. Among them them was attorney Gary Oxenhandler, who said having the art in the courthouse is a wedge. “Boone County can either be a justice leader or an embarrassing media soundbite,” he said at the hearing. “I have never met a person of color who needed to be reminded their ancestors were lynched by mobs or beaten by police.”\n\nMontana\n\nBusby: Researchers are looking for the graves of nine soldiers killed in the Battle of the Rosebud, the largest battle of the Plains Wars. The fighting involved the U.S. government, committed to confining the Indigenous peoples of the continent to reservations, and the Cheyenne and Lakota who continued to resist, the Billings Gazette reports. To prevent their bodies from being discovered, men under the command of Gen. George Crook built a massive fire over the grave. Once it was snuffed out, they rode horses over the burned earth and covered any trace of who laid below. With much of the battlefield largely unchanged over the next 145 years, a team of researchers conducted a survey last week trying to find those nine men. The hunt for the soldiers’ grave – one of several projects intended to clarify the events of a day often overshadowed by the obliteration of Lt. Col. George Custer and his 263 soldiers – is the result of a partnership among Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, tribal officials, the State Historic Preservation Office and faculty with Colorado Mesa University. “What we’re trying to do is put together the physical history of the battle and see how it fits with Native American oral accounts and written records. We look at it as a crime scene, quite in the literal sense,” said Doug Scott, an expert in forensic and military archaeology with Colorado Mesa University.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials are refusing to release presentations the state has received from a nonprofit group that is analyzing criminal justice data to help Nebraska deal with severe overcrowding in its prison system. Gov. Pete Ricketts’ office refused the Omaha World-Herald’s request for those reports from the Crime and Justice Institute because the group of state officials who heard the presentations isn’t a public body, and officials said the information is still in draft form. “If there’s any legislation that comes out of it, it will go to a hearing just like any other bill, and the public will have a chance to weigh in on that,” Ricketts said. At some point, he said, data will be released in support of any prospective legislation. The director of the Nebraska ACLU, Danielle Conrad, said it doesn’t make sense to her that presentations given to a committee composed of public officials would be considered drafts. The ACLU, which has opposed Ricketts’ proposal to build a new prison, said state officials should uphold Nebraska’s “strong and proud tradition of open government” and release the reports. State Corrections Director Scott Frakes is expected to address prison overcrowding concerns when he testifies before the Legislature on Wednesday, but it doesn’t appear likely he will address the work state officials are doing with CJI.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials report a dramatic increase in drug overdose deaths in the state between 2019 and 2020. Accidental overdoses among Nevadans totaled 788 in 2020, a 55% increase from 510 in 2019, the Nevada Overdose Data Program reported Thursday. The number of overdose deaths among people younger than 25 nearly tripled, from 38 in 2019 to 106 in 2020. According to the state’s drug overdose reporting system, 1 of every 2 overdose deaths involved a person with a mental health problem, while 3 in 4 overdose victims had an identified substance misuse problem not related to alcohol. The opioid overdose antidote naloxone is available free statewide, and the overdose data program encourages Nevadans to learn about the life-saving resource. Naloxone can be obtained in Nevada without a prescription. In 2015, Nevada adopted the Good Samaritan Overdose Law, which protects a person from prosecution for many narcotics-related offenses when seeking medical assistance for another person for a drug-related emergency.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Insurance has launched the state’s new HealthCost website to help people compare prices across health care facilities. The site, launched Friday, also includes information on health insurance and an interactive tool to compare hospitals’ quality of care, cleanliness and customer satisfaction. The site can be accessed at nhhealthcost.nh.gov. NH HealthCost, created by the Insurance Department in 2007, uses paid claims data collected from New Hampshire’s health insurers to show patients – insured and uninsured – an estimated price for a procedure. Patients can access the total costs of their procedures, including physician fees, lab fees and facility fees.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaplewood: Outrage swept social media Friday over allegations that a teacher had pulled a hijab from the head of a second grade student. For Muslims, many of whom view the hijab as an expression of faith, the alleged episode was hurtful and offensive and highlighted what community leaders say is a larger problem of bias in the classroom. “This is really a wake-up call for districts,” said Nagla Bedir, founder of Teaching While Muslim, a New Jersey-based nonprofit focused on education and anti-bias training. “A lot of schools across the country have tried to be more inclusive and anti-racist, but part of anti-racism is also (teaching about) Islamophobia.” The South Orange-Maplewood School District said it was investigating the allegations, which were detailed in an Instagram post Thursday by Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Maplewood native who said she is friends with the child’s mother. The bronze-medal winner was the first Muslim American woman to wear a hijab while competing at the Olympic Games. Muhammad said the teacher “forcibly removed” the girl’s hijab in class. The teacher “told the student that her hair was beautiful and she did not have to wear hijab to school anymore,” she wrote. “Imagine being a child and stripped of your clothing in front of your classmates. ... This is abuse.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of environmental groups is raising concerns about Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s plans to turn the state into a hydrogen fuel hub. The Democrat, who is running for reelection, has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 45% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. The Natural Resource Defense Council, the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center and two dozen other organizations argue in a letter sent to the governor and other top elected officials last week that large-scale development of hydrogen risks incentivizing new oil and natural gas fields. Hydrogen fuel cells can power vehicles to reduce transportation emissions, but most energy used to produce hydrogen comes from natural gas. Some are hopeful that hydrogen can be produced by using electricity generated from solar or wind power to separate hydrogen and oxygen in water. However, the letter warns of excessive water use in a state where the commodity is already scarce. The groups urged the governor to focus on wind and solar energy instead. Lujan Grisham has expressed interest in speaking at a climate change conference next month. Earlier this year, she asked President Joe Biden to exempt oil and gas producers in New Mexico from a drilling moratorium.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s annual Columbus Day Parade returned Monday after being canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Marching bands and floats traveled up Fifth Avenue as spectators waved green, white and red Italian flags. Organizers said 35,000 marchers took part in the parade, and tens of thousands more watched. Billed as the nation’s largest celebration of Italian American pride, the Columbus Day Parade has faced criticism in recent years from activists who fault the 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus for his brutal treatment of Indigenous people in the West Indies. Some communities have responded to the controversy by replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, and President Joe Biden on Friday issued the first-ever presidential proclamation of Indigenous Peoples Day, which was observed Monday along with Columbus Day. Born in the Republic of Genoa, part of modern-day Italy, Columbus sailed from Spain in August 1492 and landed on an island in the Bahamas on Oct. 12 of that year. Many of the native people were forced into servitude. Multitudes died of disease. Spain repopulated the workforce with African slaves. President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed the first national Columbus Day in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his “discovery” of the Americas.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The N.C. Department of Transportation has signed a $432 million contract to rebuild 8 miles of Interstate 95 through one county with an eye on eliminating a recurring flooding problem. Flooding resulting from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018 closed the highway in Robeson County for several days, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Starting next year, contractors will begin work on widening I-95 from four lanes to eight and replace bridges at three interchanges. Contractors will use fill dirt to raise the highway above its current elevation through Lumberton, said Matt Lauffer, NCDOT’s hydraulics design engineer. Lauffer said the work aims to raise all bridges and culverts high enough to handle a 100-year flood, plus provide an 18-inch cushion so items floating underneath can pass. The project also calls for a new, higher bridge to carry I-95 over the Lumber River, where floodwaters left the interstate impassable for several days after both hurricanes. Construction on the Lumberton section of I-95 is scheduled to begin next summer and be completed by late summer 2026. NCDOT expects to award two more contracts to widen another 15 miles of I-95 between Lumberton and Fayetteville, starting next fall.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The abrupt closure of a photography business has left couples in a four-state area scrambling to locate wedding photos or find new photographers for upcoming nuptials. Glasser Images owner Jack Glasser said in a statement Friday that due in large part to COVID-19, the Bismarck studio “simply couldn’t keep up with our ongoing costs, debt repayment, salaries, rent and other business expenses.” He told customers in an email that he cannot offer refunds. The move has Johnny Thompson and wife Crystal Brunner-Thompson wondering if they will ever receive photos of their August wedding. They paid more than $2,000 for the Bismarck event. “I’m an only child,” Brunner-Thompson said. “My parents are never going to get to do this again. I have no photos with my parents. I’d never seen my dad get emotional. It’s just stuff you can’t get back.” Glasser Images photographed weddings throughout the Dakotas, Minnesota and Colorado without charging for travel costs, according to the company website. The North Dakota Attorney General’s Office said it had fielded more than 170 complaints about the situation by Friday afternoon and was investigating. Glasser’s attorney, Tim O’Keeffe, told The Bismarck Tribune he and Glasser will try to talk with customers in the coming days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Alumni of Ohio Wesleyan University are speaking out after their alma mater was used to film a U.S. Senate campaign ad that demonizes athletes who kneel during the national anthem. GOP candidate Mike Gibbons released an ad last month that paints Democrats, corporations and media as anti-faith and claims they want to “replace God with government.” The video also takes aim at former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started a movement after he refused to stand during the anthem to protest racial injustice. “I believe in an America where we kneel in devotion, not disrespect,” Gibbons says, as an image of Kaepernick flashes across the screen. The ad also shows an anti-critical race theory sign. Gibbons’ campaign filmed the ad at OWU’s Selby Stadium, which one former student who played football there quickly noticed. Alumni say the ad is divisive and contrary to the Delaware, Ohio, liberal arts school’s values of diversity and inclusion. Gibbons, who played football at Kenyon College, is running in the crowded race to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman. The ad was part of a $10 million ad buy aimed at keeping him on air until the May primary.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Architectural consultants hired by the Oklahoma County Criminal Justice Advisory Council have shared two multimillion-dollar options for the future of the Oklahoma County Jail, but some citizens are calling for investments in social services instead. The options, one to build an entirely new facility and a second to renovate the existing facility and add an annex, both come with price tags of several hundred million dollars. A new facility valued at $300 million would allow the county to abandon the current, troubled, 30-year-old high-rise facility. Renovation, according to architectural consultants John Semtner and Jeff Bradley, is possible but would mean added time and complexities due to years of deferred maintenance and the requirement to move detainees while each floor of the 13-story building is being worked on. Still frustrated with what they view as a lack of overall progress by the jail trust, some citizens called Thursday’s meeting at which the options were unveiled a sales pitch rather than a listening session. Others argued with assessments of the size of the jail. Many residents cited concerns that building a new, possibly bigger jail would just lead to county officials trying to fill it, recreating the same conditions that exist in the current jail.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown is requesting disaster relief from the federal government for the state’s strained commercial salmon industry. The governor submitted the formal aid request last week to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Brown wrote that the economic return from commercial salmon fishing along most of the coast since 2018 has been less than one-third of what it was in previous years. She said the trend is having severe effects on already distressed rural communities and businesses that depend on salmon. “While economic assistance will be essential to address the impacts of closures and restrictions on our salmon fisheries, it is vitally important that federal, state, tribal, and local governments continue to work together to recover and restore salmon populations and develop management strategies to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our salmon fisheries,” she said in the letter. State Rep. David Gomberg, D-Otis, is the chair of the Legislature’s Oregon Coastal Caucus, which urged Brown to seek disaster aid. If the relief money comes through, Gomberg said it will help buy time while longer-term solutions are worked out. There is no timeline for when the U.S. Department of Commerce might make its decision.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nKennett Square: President Joe Biden attended his nephew’s wedding in the state where he was born Monday before returning to Washington for the week. The president and his wife, Jill Biden, attended the wedding of Cuffe Owens, the son of Biden’s sister Valerie Biden Owens, to Meghan O’Toole King. King is a former cast member on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” while Owens is an attorney. The event was held at Biden Owens’ home. King shared a photo of the two on Instagram in September, writing: “meet my man.” Joe Biden had a quiet weekend in Wilmington, Delaware, visiting church early Sunday but otherwise keeping to his home. King was previously married to retired MLB player Jim Edmonds.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Johnson & Wales University is suing its insurer over financial losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alleging the company breached its contract because it did not allow the university to claim pandemic-related economic losses. The university, whose main campus is based in Providence, said the American Guarantee & Liability Company’s current policy does not have preventive pandemic-related coverage in its insurance policy to cover economic losses. As a result of the pandemic, the university said it lost enrollment, tuition, housing and dining revenues while expensing additional COVID-19 safety protocols. In the lawsuit, Johnson & Wales asked the court to rule that the insurer must cover its financial losses “totaling many millions of dollars.” A spokesperson for Zurich Insurance Group, American Guarantee’s parent company, did not respond to an email seeking comment. The company has also not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An appellate court is set to debate a lawsuit challenging South Carolina’s abortion law about a week after the U.S. Supreme Court considers a similar measure in Mississippi. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has tentatively scheduled the South Carolina case for oral arguments the week of Dec. 6, according to an order from the court posted Friday. Planned Parenthood is suing South Carolina over the measure, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year and requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a so-called fetal heartbeat. If cardiac activity – which can typically be detected about six weeks into pregnancy – is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Opponents have argued that many women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks and that with such an early deadline, the law gives women little time to consider whether to have an abortion. Medical experts say the cardiac activity is not an actual heartbeat but rather an initial flutter of electric activity within cells in an embryo. They say the heart doesn’t begin to form until the fetus is at least 9 weeks old, and they decry efforts to promote abortion bans by relying on medical inaccuracies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Boy Scouts of America are set to sell a campground to the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department for $2million. Department officials confirmed at their October meeting that the Boy Scouts are ready to finalize the sale of the 223-acre campground to the agency in late November. The state appraised the property at $3.59 million earlier this year. The campground sits between Newton Hills State Park and the Johnson Game Production Area. Boy Scout leaders have talked about selling it since 2011. A push from national Scout leaders to upgrade existing facilities led them to approach GFP officials about a sale last year. The campground was built during the 1930s and would require extensive improvements to bring it up to Boy Scouts of America standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State agriculture officials are offering to share the costs with landowners who are interested in improving the forests and watersheds on their properties near two rivers. The state Department of Agriculture says the Duck and Elk Watershed Initiative is open for applications until Oct. 29. The counties in the watershed of the Duck and Elk rivers include Bedford, Coffee, Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Hickman, Humphreys, Lewis, Lincoln, Marshall, Maury, Moore and Williamson. Eligible activities include tree planting, forest improvement, invasive plant management and prescribed burning. The activities should be implemented from January through May of next year. The Division of Forestry is offering free site visits and consultations on action plans to improve the watershed.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Executions in the nation’s busiest capital punishment state face delays amid legal questions about Texas’ refusal to allow spiritual advisers to touch inmates and pray aloud as condemned individuals are being put to death. It’s unclear when Texas may carry out another execution after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to hear religious freedom claims from death row inmate John Henry Ramirez. The court blocked his execution last month, about three hours after it could have been carried out. Several other inmates have since made similar claims, and courts have put some of their executions on hold. “It would be unusual for somebody who has the same issue to not get a stay while the Supreme Court is deciding that issue. It would be very unusual,” said Michael Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. A ruling from the Supreme Court could be months away. It’s set to hear oral arguments Nov. 1. Ramirez says the state is violating his religious freedom by not letting his spiritual adviser lay hands on him and pray out loud as he is executed. Texas prison officials say that direct contact poses a security risk and that prayers said aloud could be disruptive.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: An unexpected snowstorm forced the rescue of dozens of runners in a long-distance trail race in the mountains of northern Utah. None of the 87 or so runners rescued Saturday was hospitalized, though several were treated for hypothermia, and one was hurt in a fall, according to Davis County Sheriff Kelly Sparks. “We feel very fortunate today that there were no serious injuries,” Sparks said. The 50-mile race in the Francis Peak area between Ogden and Salt Lake City began at 5 a.m. Severe weather struck about four hours later. Some runners were wearing just shorts and a T-shirt, authorities said. Race organizers had told runners to expect rain, but the rain turned to snow, runner Kelcey McClung Stowell said. “We thought, ‘We’ll be OK once we get to Francis Peak, and then we start coming down the mountain. We’ll be out of the snow, and it’ll be fine,’ ” Stowell said. “But it just turned terrible. It was just like a blizzard up there.” Temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and as much as 18 inches of snow fell in strong wind. Rescuers using snowmobiles and other vehicles caught up with runners on the route and got them out of the mountains, KSL-TV reports. All runners were accounted for by 2:45 p.m.\n\nVermont\n\nWeybridge: After erosion washed away some graves at an old cemetery near a riverbank, the remains of two Revolutionary War soldiers and others buried there will be moved to a new resting place. Revolutionary War soldier Josiah Clark, who fought at the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill in Massachusetts, was buried in the Stow cemetery in Weybridge in 1835. Erosion over the years left his grave perched on the edge of the steep eroding bank, so his bones were exhumed in 2019. Revolutionary War soldier William Haven is also buried there, a bit farther back from the bank. The roughly 20 graves eventually will be moved to the Old Weybridge Hill Cemetery. An archeological team from the University of Vermont is now working to remove graves along the bank, starting with the ones most at risk, Tom Giffin, president of the Vermont Old Cemetery Association, said Monday. “I feel relieved that they’ll not be washed over the bank and go down Otter Creek. I thought that was awful wrong,” Giffin said. “My big thing is this is a history of the United States, as well as a history of Vermont, as well as a history of Weybridge.” The archeological team, including students, started its work last week, and the first reinternments are expected to take place next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: More than $33 million in U.S. Department of Justice grants has been awarded to 26 Virginia-based public and nonprofit organizations to fund programs that address violence against women, a federal prosecutor says. Acting U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh said in a news release Friday that the grants will provide funding and essential services to vulnerable communities – especially women, people with disabilities and immigrants – who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The department’s Office on Violence Against Women selected organizations from across the Eastern District of Virginia to receive funding through 42 separate grants. The money will allow the organizations to better address a wide variety of needs and issues facing victims of domestic and sexual violence. The recipients include state government entities that provide services throughout the commonwealth, as well as nongovernmental organizations that provide technical training and assistance nationwide. In addition, grants were awarded to universities to combat domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking on campus. Multiple nonprofit organizations that provide direct services to victims and survivors in the district also received funding.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A mandatory payroll tax to fund the state’s new long-term care program will start coming out of most workers’ paychecks in January. The insurance benefit, dubbed the WA Cares Fund, is a first-in-nation public insurance program aimed at helping older residents age in their own homes, The Seattle Times reports. The plan, signed into law in 2019 through the Long Term Care Trust Act, will use a 0.58% payroll tax to pay up to a $36,500 benefit for individuals to pay for home health care and an array of services related to long-term health care including equipment, transportation and meal assistance. The plan is expected to save $3.9 billion in state Medicaid costs by 2052, and eligible beneficiaries will be able to begin collecting benefits starting in 2025. The program has drawn both ire and praise from advocacy groups and politicians. Advocates cite a rapidly aging population and high premiums on the current private long-term care market, while critics have lambasted the plan as expensive, unnecessary and inflexible in terms of eligibility and payout.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nDavis: Two locations have been added to a new program to protect rare plant and animal species. Bald Knob and the Canaan Valley wetlands are the first sites in the West Virginia Natural Areas Program, the state Division of Natural Resources said in a news release. The program places extra protection on areas with significant conservation needs under the agency’s administration. Both areas are within the Canaan Valley Resort State Park. The areas include more than 2,200 acres of rare conifer swamps and red spruce forest with more than 40 rare plants, 12 rare invertebrates and several animals unique to the area, the agency said. “These two areas have the state’s highest concentration of federally listed species and species of greatest conservation need, and this designation is going to give us the awareness and resources we need to make sure they are properly managed,” said Scott Warner, the division’s assistant chief of wildlife diversity.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: Gov. Tony Evers issued a formal apology Monday for the state’s role in Native American boarding schools, joining with tribal leaders at an Indigenous Peoples Day event. Evers signed an executive order that also formally supported the previously announced U.S. Department of the Interior investigation into the schools and asked that anything done in Wisconsin be conducted in consultation with the state’s tribes. Wisconsin is home to 11 recognized American Indian tribes. Starting with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the U.S. enacted laws and policies to establish and support Indian boarding schools across the nation. For more than 150 years, Indigenous children were taken from their communities and forced into boarding schools that focused on assimilation. Records show that Wisconsin was home to at least 10 day and boarding schools attended by thousands of American Indian children between the 1860s and 1970s, the governor’s office said. Additionally, hundreds of children were sent from Wisconsin to attend out-of-state schools, the governor’s office said. The lack of available and reliable documentation related to the schools makes it challenging to know the full scope of what happened in Wisconsin, Evers’ office said.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: A lab at the University of Wyoming is monitoring wastewater in six communities to track the coronavirus’ presence in the state, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Funded by an $800,000 state grant, the university’s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is regularly testing wastewater from Cowley, Deaver, Hudson, Laramie, Pinedale and Powell as part of a 30-town tracking effort to see where COVID-19 may be going undetected, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/12"}]}

It has been updated to reflect Florida’s 2023 special legislative session.\n\nCNN —\n\nDisney’s Orlando-area theme parks and who will govern them are under renewed scrutiny in Florida – the latest in a yearlong spat between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest private employer.\n\nLawmakers have returned to Tallahassee for a special session called in part to address what happens to Disney’s special taxing district, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after they previously passed legislation dissolving it, which was supposed to take effect in June.\n\nState Republicans on Monday unveiled a bill to turn over control of Disney’s special taxing district to a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis and rebrand Reedy Creek the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.”\n\nThe move to take over Reedy Creek comes after DeSantis sparred last year with Disney over a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHere’s a look at the history of Reedy Creek, why it has become the focus of another special legislative session in Florida, and how proposed changes would give DeSantis more control.\n\nWhat is Reedy Creek?\n\nReedy Creek is the name for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special purpose district created by state law in May 1967 that gives The Walt Disney Company governmental control over the land in and around its central Florida theme parks. The district sits southwest of Orlando.\n\nAt the time, the land was little more than uninhabited pasture and swamp, according to Reedy Creek’s website. With the special purpose district, Disney took over responsibility for providing municipal services like power, water, roads and fire protection – but was also freed from dealing with legal red tape or paying taxes for services that benefited the broader public.\n\nAccording to Richard Foglesong, the author of the book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando,” Disney had previously had issues with the government of Anaheim, California, at its Disneyland park, completed a decade earlier. With those issues in mind, Disney pushed for a special purpose district in Florida that would give the company the ability to self-govern.\n\nIn exchange, Florida became the home base for Disney World and its millions of tourists.\n\n“Florida needed Disney more than Disney needed Florida,” Foglesong told CNN.\n\nToday, the Reedy Creek special district encompasses about 25,000 acres in Orange and Osceola counties, including four theme parks, two water parks, one sports complex, 175 lane miles of roadway, 67 miles of waterway, and the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, its website says.\n\n“The cooperation and commitment between the Reedy Creek Improvement District and Walt Disney World Company is as strong today as it was when the District was created in 1967,” the Reedy Creek website states. “The result is an example of how a working partnership between business and government can be prosperous for both sides.”\n\nWhy is this an issue now?\n\nLast year, DeSantis challenged lawmakers to unravel the 55-year-old Reedy Creek Improvement Act as part of a special legislative session and ultimately signed a bill that would sunset the district on June 1.\n\nLawmakers left town without a plan to unwind a half-century of Disney control or for how to ensure Orange and Osceola county residents wouldn’t be on the hook for funding Reedy Creek services or its $1 billion in debt. Amid the fallout, Reedy Creek told its bondholders that Florida could not dissolve the district without assuming its debts.\n\nDeSantis repeatedly offered assurances that taxpayers wouldn’t have to pick up the tab.\n\nNow, GOP lawmakers have returned to the state Capitol and are trying to breath new life into the taxing district and keep many of its special powers. The final page of the 189-page bill proposed Monday states: “The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled legislature is likely to pass the proposed changes within the next couple of weeks and the governor is supportive of them.\n\nWhat are lawmakers proposing?\n\nThe bill, introduced Monday by state Rep. Fred Hawkins, seeks to limit the damage that could be done to Disney, one of the state’s most vital tourism engines, and to taxpayers.\n\nThe measure guarantees that the changes to Reedy Creek will not affect the district’s existing debt or any other contracts.\n\nInstead of ending the district, the proposed legislation would rebrand it as the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District” and curb some of its powers, including the ability to build an airport or a nuclear power plant.\n\nThe board, previously made up of Reedy Creek landowners with close ties to Disney, will instead become a five-member board of supervisors appointed by the governor. The bill makes clear that none of the appointees chosen by the governor can be recent Disney employees or their relatives, nor that of a competitor. The state Senate, where Republicans hold a super majority, would have final approval of the appointees.\n\n“These actions ensure a state-controlled district accountable to the people instead of a corporate-controlled kingdom,” DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said.\n\nWhat has Disney said?\n\nDisney said Monday it is watching the bill.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is “monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.”\n\n“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” Vahle said.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Florida schools?\n\nReedy Creek has been tied to the feud between DeSantis, who has widely been seen as a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, and Disney over a measure that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.\n\nThe “Parental Rights in Education” bill – which critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – was signed into law last March and prohibits schools from teaching children about sexual orientation or gender identity “in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” The legislation also allows parents to bring lawsuits against a school district for potential violations.\n\nThe law’s vague language and the threat of parental lawsuits have raised fears that it will lead to discrimination against LGBTQ students and will have a chilling effect on classroom discussion. DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said on Twitter last year that the legislation would protect kids from “groomers,” a slang term for pedophiles, and described those who oppose the law as “probably groomers.”\n\nBob Chapek, the then-CEO of Disney, which employs 75,000 people in Florida, initially declined to condemn the law last year but reversed course after facing employee criticism. A company spokesperson then released a statement stating its goal was for the law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.\n\n“Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,” the March 2022 statement said. The company said it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Dianne Gallagher Steve Contorno Jack Forrest", "Eric Levenson", "Dianne Gallagher", "Steve Contorno", "Jack Forrest"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/politics/abortion-bans-murder-charges-invs/index.html", "title": "These male politicians are pushing for women who receive ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA businessman turned state representative from rural Oil City, Louisiana, and a Baptist pastor banded together earlier this year on a radical mission.\n\nThey were adamant that a woman who receives an abortion should receive the same criminal consequences as one who drowns her baby.\n\nUnder a bill they promoted, pregnant people could face murder charges even if they were raped or doctors determined the procedure was needed to save their own life. Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

No question.”\n\n“We are serious about taking action.”\n\n“Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action.”\n\nFacebook, now known as Meta (FB), has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill for years, with executives — including Zuckerberg — repeatedly grilled in Congressional hearings. But if these and other comments from lawmakers during hearings in recent months are any indication, 2022 could shape up to be a make-or-break year in the long-running effort to regulate Facebook.\n\nCongress is currently considering around a dozen proposed bills targeting Big Tech, some of which could force Meta to change how it handles algorithmic recommendations and collecting user data, as well as its ability to make acquisitions. A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general launched an investigation late last year into Meta, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on young users.\n\nAnd last week, a federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission could move forward with a lawsuit seeking to break up Meta, after the company had argued the complaint should be dismissed. (The case could drag on for years.) The FTC and several state attorneys general are also reportedly investigating Meta’s Oculus virtual reality unit over antitrust concerns, according to a Bloomberg report Friday citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSome industry watchers have pointed to recently appointed federal officials such as FTC Chair Lina Khan, a vocal tech industry critic, and the sharper focus of lawmakers as cause for optimism that something may happen on the regulatory front.\n\n“You’re seeing a lot less of the politicized commentary and a lot more focus and coordination on these issues, the underlying technology behind them and the business model,” said Katie Paul, director at the tech advocacy group Tech Transparency Project. “It’s clear that a lot of these members of Congress have done their homework and they understand what they’re looking at.”\n\nStill, after years of talk and glimmers of progress, it remains unclear if or when US lawmakers and regulators might take successful action — as their EU and UK counterparts have — that would limit Meta’s power, as well as that of Big Tech more broadly. And the window of opportunity may be limited as preparations for the US midterm elections could divert attention from advancing new legislation.\n\nRecent revelations from former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen and the hundreds of internal documents she leaked have galvanized bipartisan support for new legislation related to protecting children online. But the likelihood of success for the many other Meta-related proposals is murkier, and not just because of the company’s immense lobbying power.\n\nDespite their agreement that something should be done to address Big Tech’s dominance -— and to crack down on Meta in particular — Democrats and Republicans are divided on what the core problem really is. Republicans accuse Facebook of anti-conservative bias, despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats are concerned that the company doesn’t do enough to protect against hate speech, misinformation and other problematic content.\n\nThe stakes for action, or inaction, are only growing. The “Facebook Papers” revealed a wide range of potential real-world harms and consequences from Meta’s platforms. Yet, lawmakers are largely still playing catch up in understanding and regulating the company’s older platforms, even as Meta pushes to transition into a “metaverse company” and perhaps shape a whole new generation of user experiences.\n\n“Congress must seize this historic moment — a pivotal turning point for reining in Big Tech,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, told CNN Business. “Having seen Big Tech’s harms and abuses, in our hearings and their own lives, Americans are ready for action — and results.”\n\nHere are a few of the approaches lawmakers could take.\n\nSection 230\n\nOne of the first places lawmakers and experts often look when considering new rules for tech companies like Meta is a piece of federal legislation called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nThe 25-year-old law prevents tech companies from being held liable for the content that users post on their platforms. For years, big tech companies have leaned on the law to avoid being held responsible for some of the most controversial content on their platforms, using it to dismiss lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.\n\nMomentum has grown on Capitol Hill around the idea of scrapping or updating Section 230, which could expose tech platforms to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation. Proposed changes include making platforms liable for hosting child abuse content. President Biden has also suggested platforms should be held responsible for hosting misinformation related to vaccines. (Social media companies and industry organizations have lobbied hard against changes to Section 230.)\n\nBut there’s one big hurdle to this approach, experts say: the First Amendment. Even if lawmakers got rid of Section 230 and, for example, Meta faced lawsuits over misinformation on its platforms, that speech is protected by the First Amendment. That means the company would probably still win out in the end, according to Jeff Kosseff, cybersecurity law professor at the US Naval Academy and author of a book about Section 230 called “The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet.”\n\n“Where Section 230 really makes a difference is in things like defamation lawsuits,” Kosseff said. “But that’s not really what’s driving the debate around Facebook and other social media sites — it’s more of this lawful but awful types of content.”\n\nKosseff also raised the concern that trying to hold tech platforms responsible for certain types of speech — such as health misinformation — could give the government significant leeway in determining what content falls into those categories.\n\n“There have been some countries that have passed fake news laws, and they’ve misused them just as you would expect that you would,” he said.\n\nAlgorithms\n\nHaugen, meanwhile, has encouraged reforming Section 230 to hold platforms accountable for how their algorithms promote content. In that scenario, Meta and other tech companies still would not be responsible for user-generated content, but could be held liable for the way their algorithms promote and cause that content to go viral.\n\nBipartisan legislation introduced in the House in November would take a slightly different tack by forcing large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn’t shaped by algorithms at all.\n\nPerhaps anticipating such a law, Meta-owned Instagram has said it will bring back the option for users to access a reverse chronological version of their feed (one not manipulated by its algorithm) later this year. Facebook already offers this option but it can be frustrating to use — rather than being an option in settings, where users might expect, it’s toggled using a button in a long menu on the left side of the NewsFeed screen, and it resets every time you close the site.\n\nPrivacy\n\nLawmakers have also used recent hearings about Meta to rail for updated privacy laws.\n\n“We have not done anything to update our privacy laws in this country, our federal privacy laws. Nothing. Zilch,” Minnesota Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during Haugen’s hearing.\n\nCurrently, progress on this front is coming more at the state level than the federal level.\n\nCalifornia’s Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect last year, gives consumers the right to demand that large companies disclose what data they have collected on them. Under the law, consumers can also ask companies to delete their data and, in some cases, sue companies for data breaches. Meanwhile, Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (set to take effect in 2023) also gives consumers more control of their online data, but it includes more exceptions than the California law and doesn’t give consumers the option to sue companies. A federal bill could help provide consistent, nationwide standards for how data can be collected and sold online.\n\nCongress is considering the KIDS Act, which aims to protect internet users under 16 in various ways, including by prohibiting the use of age verification data for commercial purposes, as well as the SAFE DATA Act, which would give consumers more choice in how their data is collected and used.\n\nA new tech regulatory body\n\nIn his testimony before a Senate subcommittee earlier this month, Instagram head Adam Mosseri proposed the creation of an industry body that would set standards for “how to verify age, how to build age-appropriate experiences, how to build parental controls,” and other social media best practices.\n\nBut lawmakers didn’t seem enthusiastic about the idea of leaving standards-setting and oversight to industry players. “Self-policing depends on trust and the trust is gone,” Blumenthal said during Mosseri’s hearing.\n\nInstead, lawmakers and advocates are pushing for the creation of a new federal regulatory body responsible for overseeing Big Tech. The group could be tasked with developing the framework and structures needed to regulate the tech industry, similar to the mechanisms within the government that help oversee the banking industry, TTP’s Paul said. It could also, as Haugen testified, serve as “a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty.”\n\nSuch a group would help supplement the limited existing accountability structures surrounding Meta. The Facebook Oversight Board — which says it acts independently, although its members are appointed and paid by the company — is only responsible for weighing in on content moderation decisions. Even then, the group has recently focused on smaller, one-off flubs, rather than the many broader, structural problems the company faces (although it has made larger calls for transparency).\n\nThe role of the FTC\n\nIf Congress does pass any Big Tech laws, the FTC will play a key role in enforcing them. And even if we don’t see new legislation in the next year, Meta won’t necessarily be off the hook.\n\nThe judge’s Tuesday ruling in the FTC case opens the door to perhaps the most existential threat yet to Meta: the FTC is looking to unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. (Meta previously said it was confident “the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the [FTC’s] claims.”)\n\nThe case will give Khan, the FTC chair, a chance to make her mark in her first turn as a federal regulator — and there is some reason to believe Meta is nervous. Last July, company officials wrote to the FTC asking Khan to recuse herself from all matters related to the social media giant (she has not done so). Meta also argued that the FTC’s suit should be dismissed on the grounds that Khan should not have been able to vote to approve the updated complaint; however, the judge sided with the FTC.\n\nIn addition to the agency’s lawsuit, Khan said last month that the FTC is considering drafting new rules that would more strongly regulate how US businesses can use data and algorithms. The effort could lead to “market-wide requirements” targeting “harms that can result from commercial surveillance and other data practices,” Khan said in a letter to Blumenthal. That could deal another potential blow to Meta’s business model.\n\nAnd Friday’s report that the FTC is also working with state attorneys general to investigate potential anticompetitive practices by Meta’s Oculus — a key unit in its plans for the metaverse — indicate that its future ambitions are risk of regulatory crackdown, too.\n\n–CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/usps-reform-act-explainer/index.html", "title": "What the new USPS overhaul law means for you | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nWashington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a new law that will overhaul the US Postal Service’s finances and allow the agency to modernize its service.\n\nThe Postal Service Reform Act, which enjoyed a rare wave of bipartisan support in the House and Senate, bolsters an agency that is “as essential as it ever was,” the President said before signing the legislation.\n\n“Today, we enshrine in law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental,” Biden said.\n\nBut what exactly is in the law, and how will it affect most Americans? Here’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat’s in the law?\n\nThe Postal Service Reform Act will require retired postal employees to enroll in Medicare when eligible, while dropping a previous mandate that forced the agency to cover its health care costs years in advance.\n\nThose two measures would save the USPS nearly $50 billion over the next decade, according to the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe legislation will also require the USPS to create an online dashboard with local and national delivery time data.\n\nWhy are the USPS’ finances so dire?\n\nEstablished in 1775 to promote the free exchange of ideas across the colonies, the Postal Service is among the country’s oldest government institutions – yet it operates with few of the financial benefits of being a federal agency while still bearing many of the costs.\n\nUnlike other government agencies, the USPS generally does not receive taxpayer funding, and instead must rely on revenue from stamps and package deliveries to support itself.\n\nAnd unlike private courier services such as UPS and FedEx, the USPS cannot excise unprofitable routes because Congress stipulates that the Postal Service delivers to all homes in America – including a remote community in the Grand Canyon, where the mail is delivered by mule. And Postal Service pricing must be approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency.\n\nHow has low funding hampered the USPS?\n\nMost recently, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said that USPS’ “dire financial condition” has inhibited the service from modernizing, including from replacing the vast majority of its aging vehicle fleet with electric trucks.\n\nDeJoy said last year that longer first-class mail delivery times and cuts to post office hours across the country are among the changes in his 10-year plan for the agency.\n\nDoes the law go far enough to address the USPS’ challenges?\n\nWhile lawmakers from both parties have hailed the legislation as an important step for the USPS, Paul Steidler, a postal service expert at the Lexington Institute, told CNN it doesn’t go nearly far enough.\n\n“The bill is woefully insufficient because it does nothing to improve mail service. It takes the pressure off of the Postal Service to better understand and to reduce its costs. And it doesn’t sufficiently empower the Postal Regulatory Commission, which right now is very small and has very tiny resources compared to the Postal Service.”\n\nWhat does this law mean for mail-in ballots in future elections?\n\n“This legislation is not going to affect that in any way, positively or negatively,” Steidler told CNN.\n\nMillions of Americans voted by mail in 2020, despite then-President Donald Trump’s constant attacks on the process. Comprehensive studies of billions of ballots cast over many years indicate that the rate of voter fraud is less than 0.0001%, and Americans are likely to continue voting by mail in future elections.\n\n“They did a great job in the 2020 election in terms of getting things delivered on time. And so there’s every reason to expect that that’s going to continue this year in 2022,” Steidler said, noting that election mail “is a very small fraction of the total amount of mail that the postal service handles.”\n\nWhy do we even need an efficient USPS?\n\n“Because almost all Americans still rely on it at different times for important business correspondence, legal correspondence, notices from government, including the IRS, Department of Motor Vehicles,” Steidler said. “The US Postal Service is the only organization that can deliver the mail.”\n\n“Mail remains very important. It is especially important for those in rural communities, for the poor, for those who are disabled, and the numbers speak for themselves.”\n\nCORRECTION: The story has been corrected to specify that US Postal Service prices are approved and overseen by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/politics/independent-state-legislature-theory-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Why Republicans want to redefine one word in the Constitution ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Even if a state’s constitution or laws give power to courts or a governor, the theory argues legislatures should be able to ignore them.\n\nThe seeds for this idea, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, come from a concurring opinion by then-Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the Bush v. Gore decision that settled the 2000 presidential election.\n\nWhy is this coming up now?\n\nThe congressional map drawn by North Carolina’s GOP-controlled legislature to benefit Republicans was thrown out by the state Supreme Court earlier this year. While the state is politically split, the legislature’s map would likely have resulted in Republicans picking up two congressional seats. The state courts ultimately adopted a more even map drawn by experts that could result in Democrats gaining a seat in North Carolina. Republican lawmakers in the Tar Heel State want the US Supreme Court to allow them to ignore the state court and use the GOP-friendly map for future elections after this year’s midterms.\n\nWhat’s the most-extreme scenario?\n\nHere’s what CNN’s Ariane de Vogue and Gregory Krieg wrote: “If the theory is embraced by the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority, critics say, rogue legislators would be freed to act without any constraints by courts in their states.”\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board pointed out Tuesday that the Supreme Court, which has already said it lacks authority to address gerrymandering, may now take that power away from state courts as well. The end result, according to the Post: “…state legislatures — their own makeup the result of heavy gerrymandering — could contort congressional districts at will to ensure one party has the advantage, playing with how much every individual’s vote really counts.”\n\nWhat’s the argument in favor?\n\nThe text of the Constitution matters, even if this new interpretation unsettles US democracy.\n\n“The Elections Clause does not give the state courts, or any other organ of state government, the power to second-guess the legislature’s determinations,” the Republican lawmakers argue in the case.\n\nHere’s an extremely detailed scholarly article friendly to the idea of independent state legislatures by Florida State law professor Michael Morley.\n\nWhy is this theory gaining traction now?\n\nEvan Bernick, a law professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law, has written a new book focused on the 14th Amendment. He told me in an email that this theory “taps into a tradition that is (unfortunately) as old as the Founding but has taken on new life in recent years. This is a tradition in which only a subset of the people are allowed to rule and the rest are disregarded as somehow less than truly ‘the people.’”\n\nWho would benefit if the Supreme Court adopts this doctrine?\n\nRepublicans would. While Democrats currently hold slim majorities in the federal legislature, Republicans have a clear advantage at the state level, where they control more than 60% of state legislatures.\n\nWhat does the Constitution mean by ‘legislature?’\n\nI talked to Vikram Amar, dean of the law school at the University of Illinois. He recently published an article along with his brother, Akhil Amar of Yale Law School, dissecting and trashing the notion of independent state legislatures as “rubbish.”\n\nHe argued that conservative justices who view themselves as originalist interpreters of the Constitution’s text cannot legitimately foist this new doctrine, which he refers to in shorthand as “ISL,” onto the country.\n\nPlus, the people writing the Constitution had a more expansive view of the term “legislature” that’s in line with allowing courts to protect the rights of voters in their states.\n\n“It’s inconsistent with the practices of state legislatures and state constitutions in 1787, and it’s flouting 100 years of clear precedent from 1916 all the way to 2019,” Amar said of ISL.\n\nLegislatures ignoring courts. Why does this sound familiar?\n\nSupporters of former President Donald Trump riffed on the doctrine as they proposed GOP-controlled legislatures in key states ignore the 2020 presidential election results and simply appoint their own slate of electors to do an end-run around the election he lost and keep Trump in the White House. Amar referred to this plan as “ISL on steroids.”\n\nBut that could be reality if the Supreme Court were to fully embrace ISL. Amar threw out a hypothetical where a legislature simply decided before an election it would not be bound by the voters and then put forward its own slate of electors.\n\n“If you buy ISL, they can do that,” Amar said. “If you don’t buy ISL, then they probably can’t do that because in most states, the state constitution will say that the electors are selected by the people.”\n\nDo voters often disagree with their legislatures?\n\nYou could argue that since legislatures are picked by voters, they should not be encumbered by state courts in the presidential selection process. Courts, after all, are less accountable to voters than legislators.\n\nOn the other hand, voters have routinely voted for a president other than the party that controls their legislature. President Joe Biden won the White House because multiple states with GOP-controlled legislatures in 2020 – Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, for example – picked him over Trump.\n\nWhat is the role of gerrymandering in all of this?\n\nAmar argued state legislatures are heavily gerrymandered, often giving one party more control over a state than it has support among citizens.\n\n“You may have the hearts and minds of 40% of the state, but if you currently control the legislature, you can distribute that 40% of support you have so that you win 60% of the districts reliably,” he said.\n\nIs this the new form of democracy?\n\nA complete re-interpretation of the Constitution to give legislatures superpower over elections would be extreme. But there is an increasingly open opposition to the idea that voters should be calling the shots. Politicians seem to have no problem favoring the idea that only voters they agree with should be calling the shots and voters they disagree with should be blocked.\n\nIn a somewhat related vein, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who effectively created the conservative Supreme Court majority, has essentially promised a Republican-controlled Senate would not confirm a Supreme Court nominee for a Democratic president chosen by voters.\n\nWhat will the court do with the independent state legislature theory?\n\nCNN’s de Vogue noted in March that four Supreme Court justices – Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – “expressed some sympathy in three different disputes for the notion that state courts had overstepped their boundaries when resolving lawsuits about rules for elections.”\n\nAmar told me Kavanaugh has been notably quiet more recently.\n\nPlus, there is some question about the views of the newest conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nWhat is for sure is that the high court will be directly considering this theory in its next term.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the legislation into law on Friday.\n\nThe new law is just two pages long and avoids any discussion of details about how to unwind a half-century of infrastructure deals, nor does it lay out the next steps in the complicated process.\n\nThe lack of a concrete plan surprised and frustrated state lawmakers in Orange and Osceola counties, who suddenly realized their taxpayers could be on the hook for funding basic services and paying off Disney’s nearly $1 billion of debt.\n\n“They’re trying to unwind a whole municipal government in five days,” said Eleanor Wilking, an assistant professor at Cornell Law School studying tax policy. “The details are not trivial.”\n\nCNN spoke to a handful of experts and lawmakers to try to understand what’s next for Florida, Disney and Reedy Creek. Their answers were wary and speculative because, they said, the law itself offered few clues. Disney, too, has been conspicuously silent over the past week.\n\nBroadly, though, they suggested there were three potential paths ahead: One, inertia rules the day and local counties are stuck with a big tax bill; two, Disney files suit to stop the dissolution; or three, Disney and Florida renegotiate a new special district.\n\n“It really just depends on what Disney does and what the legislature does,” said Aubrey Jewett, associate professor at University of Central Florida and co-author of the book “Politics in Florida.” “If neither of them does much, then it falls to the local governments to sort out this mess.”\n\nOption 1: Orange and Osceola counties will pick up the bill\n\nIf nothing else changes, and Reedy Creek is dissolved in June 2023, then Orange and Osceola counties could be on the hook for significant cost increases.\n\nReedy Creek is important to Disney because it gives them greater control over their parks, said Richard Foglesong, the author of the book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.” Reedy Creek, whose budget comes almost entirely from Disney, pays for its own fire department, water systems, roadways and building inspectors, and it can issue bonds and take on debt to pay for long-term infrastructure programs.\n\nBut if Reedy Creek is dissolved, those expenses and debt payments would be absorbed by neighboring Orange and Osceola counties. The Senate bill analysis noted that the new law will have an “indeterminate fiscal impact” on the counties.\n\nOfficials in Orange County said they’ll likely have to raise property taxes on their residents. Orange County tax collector Scott Randolph told CNN on Saturday that residents could be hit with a $163 million a year tax bill when the district is dissolved.\n\n“All of that debt and obligation goes over to Orange County the minute that Reedy Creek is dissolved,” he said. He said paying that off could mean a property tax increase of 20% to 25% on homeowners. (Florida does not have a personal income tax.)\n\nState Sen. Linda Stewart, a Democrat who represents part of Orange County, told CNN on Monday there was conflicting information about what this would mean for county taxpayers. Orange County is working on releasing a more realistic breakdown of the potential impact in the next few days, she said.\n\nStill, she’s already hearing from frustrated constituents concerned that their property taxes will be going up.\n\n“We’ve got inflation, we’ve got (high) gas prices, and now we’re gonna add in a huge tax bill too? No, that is not acceptable,” she said.\n\nOption 2: Disney takes Florida to court\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What happens if Disney loses its special tax status in Florida? 06:29 - Source: CNN\n\nA second potential path ahead is that Disney sues to block the law from taking effect.\n\nOne line of argument may be that the dissolution does not follow state law. According to Florida Statute 189.072, dissolving a special district requires approval by a majority of landowners. The land of Reedy Creek is mostly owned by Disney.\n\nThe bill passed last week takes that into account, saying that, “Notwithstanding 189.072,” any special district established before 1968 will be dissolved next year. Does including the word “notwithstanding” mean that the prior law doesn’t apply?\n\nIn debating the bill last week, Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican, said the “notwithstanding” line passes legal muster.\n\n“These are not constitutional requirements. These are statutory requirements. And this bill actually changes the law, which we’re allowed to do at any time, and says that we don’t have to do those things,” he said.\n\nTo which state Rep. Dotie Joseph, a Democrat, responded: “I think to change the law that exists you would repeal it, not just put another one that contravenes it, but what do I know? I’m just a lawyer.”\n\nAnother potential lawsuit could be on free speech grounds. Though the new law does not specifically mention Disney or Reedy Creek, Florida Republicans publicly said the law was in response to the company’s criticism of the “Parental Rights in Education” bill, which critics have termed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.\n\nThat state legislation, signed into law last month, prohibits schools from teaching children about sexual orientation or gender identity “in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” After an employee uproar, Disney stated that the company’s goal was for the law to be repealed or struck down in the courts, earning the enmity of right-wing lawmakers.\n\n“They are a California company that is a guest in the state of Florida,” Fine said on CNN last week. “And they are a guest that has had special privileges that no other company has had. If you want special privileges, you’d better be on your best behavior.”\n\nDisney could sue and argue that the law was an unconstitutional punishment for corporate political speech.\n\n“All of this boils down to a spiteful Disney approach that (Republicans) didn’t like what Disney had the freedom of speech to say,” Stewart said. “People have freedom of speech, so do corporations. They’re not excluded from having freedom of speech.”\n\nFinally, Disney might not even be the only one to sue the state. Tax attorney Jacob Schumer argued that Florida had promised Reedy Creek bondholders that the state wouldn’t interfere with the district’s bonds. Dissolving Reedy Creek would violate this contractual agreement, he argued.\n\n“Florida simply cannot promise to prospective bondholders that it won’t interfere with Reedy Creek, and then dissolve Reedy Creek,” he wrote on BloombergTax.com.\n\nReedy Creek itself highlighted this issue in a statement to bondholders last week, prior to the law’s signing. Citing that aspect of the law, the district said it expects to continue business as usual.\n\n“In light of the State of Florida’s pledge to the District’s bondholders, Reedy Creek expects to explore its options while continuing its present operations, including levying and collecting its ad valorem taxes and collecting its utility revenues, paying debt service on its ad valorem tax bonds and utility revenue bonds, complying with its bond covenants and operating and maintaining its properties,” Reedy Creek said.\n\nFitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, put Reedy Creek on “Negative Watch,” meaning that there is a potential for the rating on their debt to be downgraded. Analyst Michael Rinaldi told CNN the uncertainty of the law was to blame, as the two-page bill did not lay out the process of what happens to nearly $1 billion in debt when the district is dissolved.\n\n“We’re in no man’s land with respect to where things go,” he said.\n\nOption 3: Disney and Florida renegotiate a new special district\n\nThe final path ahead – and the one that most lawmakers and experts mentioned – is that Disney and Florida renegotiate terms on a new special district with more limited powers the day that Reedy Creek dissolves.\n\nThe law passed last week explicitly allows for just such an agreement. “An independent special district affected by this subsection may be reestablished on or after June 1, 2023,” the law states.\n\nDeSantis said as much on Monday, saying that the dissolution bill passed last week is “the first step in what’s going to be a process to make sure that Disney should not run its own government.”\n\nHe insisted that Disney would still pay taxes and its debts.\n\n“Trust me, under no circumstances will Disney not pay its fair share of taxes,” he said.\n\n“Under no circumstances will Disney be able to not pay its debts. We will make sure of that,” he added.\n\nStewart said they could renegotiate on small things, such as ensuring Disney does not start fracking or build a nuclear power plant in the special district. That would allow Disney to keep most of its powers while also allowing DeSantis to maintain his right-wing credibility.\n\n“I don’t think that anybody is going to go the full route of dissolving Reedy Creek,” she said. “There may be a couple of things we can do (to negotiate). Whether that will be enough for the governor to save face with, I don’t know. I can’t read his mind. Nobody can.”\n\nWilking, the tax policy expert, said that any negotiation on the special district misses the broader issues at play: The culture wars have come for big business.\n\n“The bigger issue really is this idea that DeSantis and the Florida legislature are willing to really go head-to-head with these really large and locally significant businesses in order to prosecute their preferred cultural agenda,” she said. “That’s the real story in my opinion. The taxes are less important than the loss of control for Disney.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Steve Contorno", "Eric Levenson", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nGoing forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\n“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\nThe vote was 5-4 in favor of overturning Roe. In a joint dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan heavily criticized the majority, closing: “With sorrow – for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection – we dissent.”\n\nRELATED: Justices spar over how Roe reversal puts precedents on gay rights and contraceptives at risk\n\nThe opinion represents the culmination of a decades-long effort on the part of critics of abortion seeking to return more power to the states. It was made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority – including three of Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nAt least 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights. And an additional four states are likely to ban abortions as soon as possible without federal protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only uphold Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBiden: Ruling casts a ‘dark shadow’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk” after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“It’s a sad day for the court and for the country,” Biden said, speaking from the White House, calling for Congress to codify the right to an abortion – something that’s unlikely given the split balance of power in the Senate.\n\n“It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake, this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law,” Biden said.\n\n“It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error of the Supreme Court in my view,” he added.\n\n“The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences,” he said.\n\nPolitical response is swift\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pelosi calls Roe v. Wade ruling a 'slap in the face' to women 04:21 - Source: CNN\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ruling “such an insult, a slap in the face to women.”\n\n“There’s no point in saying good morning, because it certainly is not one,” she said. “This morning the radical Supreme Court is eviscerating women’s rights and endangering their health and safety.”\n\n“Today the Republican-controlled courts achieve their dark, extreme goal of repealing a woman’s right to make their own health decisions.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama criticized the decision, saying the high court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent but it “relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues – attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.”\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence praised the ruling, saying the high court has given the “American people a new beginning for life” and commended the justices in the majority “having the courage of their convictions.”\n\n“Now that Roe v. Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history, a new arena in the cause of life has emerged, and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and the support for women in crisis pregnancy centers to every state in America,” Pence added.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, said she objected to the decision.\n\n“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.\n\nTrigger bans mean abortion is prohibited in several states\n\nIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nThree states – Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota – have so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically upon the Supreme Court’s ruling. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nIt’s likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nSimilar to leaked draft\n\nThe final opinion was strikingly similar to the draft written by Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats his scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights.\n\nLike the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases.\n\n“What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being,’” Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft.\n\nWhat’s new is Alito’s response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the leaked draft was circulated around the court.\n\n“The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Alito wrote. “The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right – no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.”\n\nIn that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent’s failure “engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.”\n\nDissent points to potential impact on women\n\nThe dissenters said women’s rights are under attack.\n\n“Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”\n\nFriday’s opinion, the dissent said, “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.”\n\n“Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,” the liberal justices added.\n\nThe dissent also stressed how the decision will impact poor women who now will have to travel in order to obtain the procedure. “Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today’s decision.”\n\nThe dissent also lashed out at Justice Brett Kavanaugh for suggesting that the decision simply returns the abortion question to the states.\n\nAs the three liberal Justices wrote, “no language in today’s decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens,” they explained, throwing Kavanaugh’s words back at him, “‘the views of [an individual State’s] citizens’ will not matter. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to ‘New York [or] California’ but to Toronto.”\n\nChallenge brought by Mississippi\n\nChampioned by supporters of abortion and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nA majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nBefore the court was Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018 but blocked by two federal courts, which allows abortion after 15 weeks “only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality” and has no exception for rape or incest. A district court blocked the law, holding that it is in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nA panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court holding that in an “unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability.” The court said states may “regulate abortion procedures prior to viability” so long as they do not ban abortion. “The law at issue is a ban,” the court held.\n\nMississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and after the justices agreed to hear the case, the state raised the stakes and argued that the justices should not only uphold the law but also invalidate Roe and Casey.\n\nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart was blunt at oral arguments.\n\n“Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said. “They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They’ve damaged the democratic process. They poison the law. They’ve choked off compromise. For 50 years they’ve kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.”\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the Biden administration in support of the clinics. She urged the justices to uphold precedent and avoid a ruling that would disproportionally harm women who have come to depend upon the decision.\n\n“For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman’s fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,” she argued. “That guarantee, that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.”\n\nShe added: “The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.\n\nJulie Rikelman, a lawyer for Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi and Sacheen Carr-Ellis, the clinic’s medical director, told the justices that Mississippi’s ban on abortion “two months before viability” is “flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.”\n\nPublic opposed to overturning Roe\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, polling taken before the Supreme Court’s decision shows.\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed Chandelis Duster Devan Cole", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Chandelis Duster", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/politics/college-costs-government-accountability-office-report/index.html", "title": "91% of colleges don't provide students with the accurate cost ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAn independent federal agency is calling on Congress to help prevent college students from taking on an unaffordable amount of student debt.\n\nCongress should require colleges to give students an accurate price for the cost of attendance, the Government Accountability Office said in a recent report that found that most colleges fail to provide all the financial information students need.\n\nThe report comes as President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, which would deliver up to $20,000 in debt cancellation for millions of borrowers, remains blocked by federal courts.\n\nProspective college students usually receive a financial aid letter from schools once they are accepted. The letter lists costs as well as grant awards and federal loans for which the student is eligible.\n\nBut these letters are far from straightforward and have long been criticized as being unnecessarily complicated.\n\nAccording to the government’s best practices, colleges should estimate the net price – how much a student will pay to attend a particular school – by deducting only grants and scholarships from all costs like tuition, books, housing and meals. But about 91% of colleges understate or don’t include the net price at all in their letters.\n\n“Federal law doesn’t require colleges to include clear, standard information in all of their financial aid offers. Congress should consider mandating that colleges do so,” the GAO said.\n\nCurrently, the Department of Education encourages colleges to follow some best practices – but adoption has been limited, according to the report.\n\nOne of the big problems with many financial aid letters is that they subtract federal loans (money students will have to pay back with interest) from the total cost, making the price look lower than it is – and lumping the loans together with financial aid a student doesn’t have to pay back, like grants. Some letters also subtract potential earnings from federal work-study – which is not guaranteed since students must apply for those jobs – from the total cost.\n\nAnother big problem is that some letters don’t include indirect costs, like housing and food, which can sometimes be more expensive than tuition.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican, had asked the GAO to do the review and called the results “egregious and unacceptable.”\n\nFoxx and Rep. Lisa McClain, a Republican from Michigan, introduced legislation last week that would establish certain requirements for college financial aid offers.\n\nThe bill is one of many legislative efforts that aim to provide students and their families better information about the cost of college. Many of these bills, like the Understanding the True Cost of College Act, have bipartisan support but have so far failed to pass Congress.\n\nFoxx, GOP leader of the House Education and Labor Committee, has been critical of Biden’s proposed student loan forgiveness program – which, she argues will do nothing to address college costs while shifting the $400 billion cost of debt relief to taxpayers. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by June on whether the program is legal.\n\nBiden has proposed making community college free, but he can’t do that on his own and legislation to fund the initiative failed to pass Congress when it came up for a vote last year. But lawmakers did approve a $400 increase to the maximum federal Pell grant for low-income students, raising it to $6,895 a year.\n\nThe Biden administration has made it easier for certain borrowers to get debt relief. Officials have expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and streamlined the process for students who were defrauded by their for-profit college or are permanently disabled to receive student loan relief for which they have long been eligible.\n\nIn addition, last month, the Department of Justice released new guidance that aims to make it easier to have federal student loan debt discharged in bankruptcy – a particularly difficult legal process under the previous policy.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html", "title": "Cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes.

No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high.

About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/facial-recognition-bans-reversed/index.html", "title": "First, they banned facial recognition. Now they're not so sure | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nOver the past few years, a number of cities and some states enacted rules banning or restricting local police use of facial-recognition software. Now, in a handful of locations around the country, the controversial technology is making a comeback.\n\nThe city of New Orleans, which in 2020 passed an ordinance banning its police department from using facial-recognition software, decided in July to change course and allow its police officers to request permission from a superior to use facial-recognition software for violent crime investigations. The state of Virginia, meanwhile, outlawed local police and campus law enforcement use of facial recognition technology in 2021 and then approved a bill in March allowing its use by police in some situations. And in California, a law that went into effect in 2020 that temporarily forbid state and local law enforcement from using facial-recognition software in body cameras expires at the end of the year (it was enacted as a three-year rule, and an effort to make it permanent failed in the state’s senate).\n\nThere are no federal laws governing the use of facial-recognition technology, which has led states, cities, and counties to regulate it on their own in various ways, particularly when it comes to how law enforcement agencies can use it.\n\nGenerally, there are two types of facial-recognition software: one compares a photo of a person to those in a database of faces looking for a likely match (the kind of software police might use when investigating a crime, such as that sold by Clearview AI), while the other compares a photo of a person to one other image (the kind that is used when you open your iPhone with your face).\n\nThe technology has been used increasingly across the United States in recent years, but it has also been blasted by privacy and digital rights groups over privacy issues and other real and potential dangers: The technology has been shown to be less accurate when identifying people of color, and several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial recognition.\n\nTo Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the bans and subsequent changes represent a “pendulum swing.”\n\nAn NOPD officer stands before an empty Bourbon Street on February 16, 2021 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nRoughly two dozen facial-recognition bans of various types have been enacted in communities and a few states across the United States since 2019. Many of them came in 2020; as Schwartz pointed out, there was a push in favor of limiting police use of surveillance technology surrounding the protests that came in the wake of the fatal arrest of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in May of that year. Then, in the past year, “the pendulum has swung a bit more in the law-and-order direction,” he said.\n\n“In American politics there are swings between being afraid of government surveillance and being afraid of crime. And in the short term there seems to have been a swing in favor of fear of crime,” he said, adding that the EFF is “optimistic” that the overall trend is toward limiting government use of such surveillance technologies.\n\nReversals in New Orleans and Virginia\n\nWhen New Orleans approved a ban of facial-recognition technology in late 2020 as part of a broader ordinance to regulate numerous surveillance technologies in the city, six of the seven council members at the time voted in favor of it (one was absent). By contrast, when the votes were tallied in July for the ordinance that would allow police to use facial-recognition technology, four council members voted for it and two voted against it (one counsel member was absent).\n\nThe turnabout less than two years later comes after a rise in homicides, following a decline from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe new rule lets city police request the use of facial-recognition software to aid investigations related to a wide range of violent crimes, including murder, rape, kidnap, and robbery.\n\nIn a statement applauding the city council’s July 21 vote in favor of facial-recognition technology, New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said, “I am grateful that the women and men of the NOPD now have this valuable, force multiplying tool that will help take dangerous criminals off our streets.”\n\nYet Lesli Harris, a New Orleans city council member who opposed the July ordinance, is concerned about how the legislation could impact the civil rights of people in the city. “As a woman of color it’s hard for me to be in favor of facial recognition,” Harris said, pointing out that studies that have shown that the technology can be less accurate at recognizing people of color, and women of color in particular.\n\nIn Virginia, legislation that went into effect last July banned local law enforcement and campus police from using facial-recognition technology unless the state legislature first passed a rule allowing it. The state’s 2022 legislation, which became effective in July, essentially reverses that 2021 rule by allowing the use of the technology by local and campus police in certain situations.\n\nScott Surovell, a Virginia state senator who introduced the newer rule, said it is meant chiefly as a “lead generator” that police would have to independently corroborate before arresting a suspect. He also pointed out that, while the 2021 legislation stopped local police from using facial-recognition software, it didn’t prevent Virginia state law enforcement from doing so, or from using it on behalf of local police.\n\nThe 2022 legislation requires police agencies using facial-recognition software to publish a report each year about how it is being used. It also requires that police only use facial-recognition software that has been deemed at least 98% accurate across all demographics measured by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the US Commerce Department whose functions include measuring the accuracy of facial-recognition algorithms that companies and researchers submit to its lab.\n\nSeeking more guardrails\n\nIt’s still largely unknown how often facial-recognition technology is being used and where in the United States. The US government has embraced it for years and Clearview AI alone has said it counts over 3,100 US agencies among its customers, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and “hundreds of local agencies.”\n\nSurovell hopes more rules will be passed to regulate the technology in other states, similar to how law enforcement use of technologies such as radar, breath testing, and substance analysis are already regulated.\n\n“I think it’s important for the public to have faith in how law enforcement is doing their job, that these technologies be regulated and there be a level of transparency about their use so people can assess for themselves whether it’s accurate and or being abused,” he said.\n\nBut if recent developments are any indication, getting there may be a bumpy ride.\n\nIn New Orleans, an amendment that Harris and two other council members supported that would set guardrails regarding how facial-recognition technology can be used by the city’s police department — such as requiring court approval each time it is used and monthly reports about how it has been used — failed in July. Chris Kaiser, advocacy director for the ACLU of Louisiana, said he was concerned about this, in addition to the change in the city’s rules regarding the use of facial-recognition software in general.\n\n“We can’t understand why you would object to these safeguards,” he said.\n\nThe trio of New Orleans council members tried a second time on Thursday: Their proposed amendment — which was modified in several ways, including removing the need for judicial approval before the use of the technology and requiring quarterly, rather than monthly, reports regarding its use — was voted on once again. This time, it passed.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}]}

Nevertheless, \"this election is critical for the capital's future\", with the next mayor overseeing the \"root and branch\" reform of the Metropolitan Police, addressing the chronic lack of affordable housing in the capital and trying to secure Transport for London's financial future.

Instead, \"he is haunted by the spectre of defeat\", said George Eaton in The New Statesman, with both him and his team privately fearing the election may be \"far closer than most believe\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

He has urged voters not to \"let the Tories do to London what they've done to our country\", as he hit out at the \"hollow, desperate and divisive narrative\" put forward by the party.\n\nHe will face off against Conservative candidate Susan Hall, a London Assembly member and former council leader. She is a vocal supporter of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Donald Trump and is hoping to ride a \"populist (if not yet popular) ticket to City Hall\", said Londonist. Since emerging from a shortlist of relative unknowns last year, Hall has endured a series of media missteps, the latest of which was described by The Mirror as a \"meltdown\" on LBC when she was forced to admit she did not know the price of a bus fare just days after criticising a decision to freeze fares in the capital.\n\nWhile Khan and Hall are the only candidates with a serious chance of winning in May, there are 13 people standing for election. These include the Liberal Democrats' Rob Blackie, an anti-Brexit campaigner and adviser to start-up technology companies, and Reform UK's Howard Cox, a small-business adviser with a track record of campaigning for lower petrol prices. Hackney councillor and NHS inequalities adviser Zoë Garbett will be looking to build on growing support for the Greens in the capital.\n\nWhat will be the key issues?\n\nKhan is looking to focus on his environmental and council-house-building policies as key achievements of his tenure, as well as the introduction of universal free school meals for primary pupils and freezing single Tube and bus fares until 2025.\n\nThis week, Hall \"made a pitch to London's pensioners\" by vowing to reinstate free travel during peak times, said the Daily Express.\n\nBut with both main candidates \"promising to bring better, greener transport to London, crack down on crime, and build more homes, according to their campaign websites\", said the London Evening Standard podcast, \"it appears that the only issue the two disagree on is Ulez\" – which Hall has made one of the centrepieces of her campaign.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nA YouGov poll last month put Khan 25 points ahead of his Conservative rival but the mayor's aides insist that a \"perfect storm\" of factors could oust him from City Hall, said Eaton.\n\nChief among these is the change to a first-past-the-post voting system, which is seen as the big wildcard in May's election. Forced through by the government, the change in how the mayor is elected is \"expected to improve the Conservative mayoral candidate's chances of winning in a city which has been increasingly Labour-leaning in recent years”, said On London. This is because they will not have to assemble a coalition of more than 50% of the voters; they just need the most votes.\n\nLooking at the last election, in 2021, for example, Khan secured 40% of first preference votes, with his Tory rival Shaun Bailey on 35%. The new system will mean closing the gap should be easier for the Conservatives.\n\nIn a bid to counter this, Khan has warned against voting for other parties, arguing that a vote for the Greens or Liberal Democrats in a first-past-the-post system \"means one less vote for the Tories to get\".\n\nOn top of changes to the electoral system, Khan also faces the \"obstacles of incumbency\" in seeking a third term, said The Guardian, although the latest polls suggest he need not be too worried.\n\nSky Bet still has Khan as the strong favourite to win at 1-14, with Hall an outsider at 7-1, so barring some 11th-hour scandal the race looks Khan's to lose.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Austin Chen", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet"], "publish_date": "2023/07/27"}]}

A deal must be reached this week to avoid an Oct. 1 shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is trying to move a continuing resolution, a stopgap spending bill that would temporarily fund federal agencies for another 45 days and avoid a shutdown.\n\nBut it would come with a potential risk to McCarthy, who has hardline conservatives in the House calling for his removal if he works with Democrats or passes a continuing resolution.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere's what it means for you.\n\nIf there is a government shutdown, will Social Security be paid?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does the government shutdown affect me?\n\nYou don’t have to live in Washington for a government shutdown to affect you.\n\nIf lawmakers can’t reach a compromise to keep the government’s doors open, shutdowns have wide-ranging impacts for Americans. The Food and Drug Administration may have to delay some nonessential food safety inspections, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could also limit their work.\n\nFood assistance programs could also see delays, and people who need to travel across the country and around the world could see disruptions to air travel.\n\nAnd a government shutdown may impact students ranging from preschoolers to college grads. Ten thousand kids could lose access to Head Start care programs, and some student loan borrowers could see disruptions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nMcCarthy says House may vote on temporary solution Friday\n\nMcCarthy on Tuesday night said the House will look to pass their version of a stopgap measure with border security provisions toward the end of the week.\n\n\"We will move a continuing resolution, bring a rule to the floor to secure our border and keep government open,” he said.\n\nThe House speaker said regardless if the continuing resolution has enough votes to pass, the lower chamber will hold a vote on the stopgap measure with border security provisions. This will likely fall on Friday, he said.\n\n“I want to keep the government open. I want to do the job,” he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nA government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.\n\nThe stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy would there be a government shutdown?\n\nHold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nBut both of those options are unlikely as of Tuesday morning. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on one of the 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nLast week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nSenate's continuing resolution would fund government through Nov. 17\n\nThe Senate’s continuing resolution released Tuesday evening funds the government through Nov. 17.\n\nSome of the funding listed in the package includes:\n\n$4.5 billion allocated to Ukraine\n\n$6 billion in emergency funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Disaster Relief Fund\n\n$2.9 billion for Federal Aviation Administration operations\n\nSenators are voting Tuesday evening on the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill, which will be used as the vehicle to pass the stopgap measure if it passes in the upper chamber.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nHouse GOP says Senate CR is dead on arrival\n\nShortly after the Senate released its bipartisan version of a short-term stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown, House conservatives said the bill is dead on arrival in the lower chamber. Any spending package, they say, has to include border security provisions.“If you want to continue federal spending, then you have to secure the border,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., an ultra-conservative lawmaker and key negotiator in the House. “That is a position in the House that in my view, the members are not gonna yield.”Rep. Garrett Graves, R-La., a close McCarthy ally, echoed similar sentiments and told reporters House GOP lawmakers are “focused on leveraging this moment right now to force the White House into closing the border.”– Ken Tran\n\nConservative hardliners say no to any stopgap measure to avert a shutdown\n\nAs the country barrels towards a shutdown with limited time remaining for Congress to pass a funding package, the only likely resolution to avert a government shutdown is for lawmakers to pass a short-term stopgap bill – called a continuing resolution – to keep the lights on while lawmakers hammer out a deal.\n\nBut conservative hardliners, who have impeded McCarthy’s attempts to pass spending bills in demand for deep spending cuts, say they will not vote for a continuing resolution under any circumstances.\n\n“I think that we can’t continue to do DC’s status quo and expect we’re gonna get some type of change and reform,” Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., told reporters Thursday, emphasizing he would not support a stopgap measure on the House floor.\n\n“I’ll stay here late. I’ll stay here until two in the morning. I’ll work on Saturdays and I’ll work on Sundays,” Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., said, pushing for Congress to focus its work on the 12 appropriations bills needed to avert a shutdown.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhite House calls on House GOP to pass stopgap measure\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on House Republicans to join the Senate in passing a continuing resolution, according to a statement Tuesday evening.“House Republicans should join the Senate in doing their job, stop playing political games with peoples’ lives, and abide by the bipartisan deal two-thirds of them voted for in May,” she said.- Rachel Looker\n\nRepublican senators have mixed response to stopgap measure\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Tuesday evening he plans to move to advance the Senate’s continuing resolution.\n\n“Most of us came here to legislate,” he told reporters. “The power of the purse is Congress’s most important power, but it’s a situation we find ourselves in habitually these government shutdowns.”\n\nOthers favor passing spending bills themselves over a stopgap measure.\n\n“I don’t think we ought to be passing the CR. I think we ought to take up and pass appropriations bills and we need to rein in some of this out of control spending that is driving rampant inflation that is hurting Texans and Americans,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said.\n\nSouth Dakota Republican Sen. Mikes Rounds said he thinks the upper chamber will be able to pass the remaining spending bills in the next six weeks with the extension in the stopgap measure.\n\n“I think it sends a powerful message to investors if they recognize that we’re actually doing our job, even if we’re a little bit late in getting it done,” Rounds said.\n\nBut the South Dakota lawmaker said regardless of the Senate's efforts, he is still anticipating a shutdown.\n\n“And I’m sorry to say that. I would hope that cooler heads will prevail, but at this point we have to be prepared for any short-term shutdown,” he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nDo national parks close in a government shutdown?\n\nIt depends on the park. During previous shutdowns, some national parks closed entirely, while others remained technically open but without staff to maintain them\n\nSome fell into disarray, with trash piling up and toilets overflowing.\n\nBut some park service employees, such as emergency medical personnel, would still be on the job during a government shutdown. However, services could be disrupted.\n\n– Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nSchumer: ‘The Senate will move forward first’\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday afternoon Senate Democrats and Republicans have worked together to move forward with a continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that will keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30.\n\n“This C.R. is a bridge, not a final destination. It will help us achieve our immediate and necessary goal of avoiding a government shutdown and move us away from the senseless and aimless extremism that has dominated the House so we can get to work on appropriations,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged his colleagues to support the stopgap measure.\n\n“Congress needs to extend government funding by the end of this week,” McConnell said.\n\nSchumer said the upper chamber will hold its first procedural vote to move forward with a stopgap measure this evening.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a continuing resolution?\n\nA continuing resolution is a stopgap measure that extends last year's spending levels for a designated period of time.\n\nQuestions remain as to what a stopgap could look like, or for how long it would extend spending levels.\n\nPrevious stopgap measures have extended funding to the end of the calendar year, but McCarthy has hinted at a shorter, one-month extension.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nDoes Congress get paid during a shutdown?\n\nMembers of Congress will still get paid during a government shutdown. Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.\n\n“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.\n\nTheir staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat's a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.\n\nSome of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.\n\nBut so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens when the government shuts down?\n\nIn a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not \"essential\" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.\n\nThis means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.\n\nAir travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nMilitary pay could dry up during shutdown: Pentagon\n\nMilitary pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.\n\n“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.\n\nBut the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.\n\n“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.\n\nThe government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhy would this looming government shutdown be different for the military?\n\nDuring three temporary shutdowns – in late 1995 into early 1996, 2013 and late 2018 and early 2019 – military salaries were paid during the broader lapses because military spending legislation was approved separate from overall government spending, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nFor example, just before the 2013 shutdown began Congress approved legislation Sept. 30 to protect military pay and President Barack Obama signed it. The Pay Our Military Act covered pay and allowances for active-duty military and reservists, according to the report.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a spending bill that included the Defense Department, which covered the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, according to the report.\n\nBut funding for the Coast Guard dried up Dec. 21, 2018, for the 35-day shutdown because the agency is funded under the Department of Homeland Security, the report said.\n\nThe Republican-led House considered voting on a defense spending bill earlier this month, but couldn’t agree on the rules for how to debate the measure amid opposition from renegade GOP members and Democrats.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nA government shutdown isn't likely to help the stock market, investment experts say, but it probably won't hurt much.\n\nStocks are already down on the month, partly in anticipation of a potential shutdown. The benchmark S&P 500 has fallen more than 5% in September, from 4,508 to 4,274.\n\n\"You're seeing it right now,\" said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac. \"There are a lot of things going on right now, and the government shutdown is one of those straws.\"\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, and the threat of a shutdown is but one of several factors dragging markets this month, Hirsch said.\n\nBut history suggests the market will ultimately recover.\n\n\"Historically, the market has pretty much ignored government shutdowns,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\n\"There have been 20 since 1976, and whether you look at the week before the shutdown, the day before the shutdown, or the entire duration of the average nine-day shutdown, the market has gone nowhere, essentially.\"\n\nIn other words, Stovall said, the looming shutdown is \"more of a headline event than a bottom-line event.\" Past shutdowns, Stovall said, left \"angered tourists more than disappointed traders.\"\n\n−Daniel de Vise\n\nWill the government shutdown affect VA disability payments?\n\nU.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough said during a press conference last week that veterans' benefits will be available during the shutdown, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits. This includes disability payments.\n\nAfter previous shutdowns, the Veterans Affairs lobbied Congress to fund the department “on a two-year budget cycle that exempts the department,” according to Veteran.com.\n\nIn the appropriations bill passed last year, it notes that funding for the Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration “shall become available on October 1, 2023, to remain available until expended.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow long would the government shutdown last?\n\nGovernment funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown will last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.\n\nThe length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education \"have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”\n\n“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history?\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted for 35 days from late 2018 to early 2019 under the Trump administration. It went into effect after the House and Senate failed to reach a compromise on a short-term funding plan to keep the government running through early next year.\n\nThe critical issue was that Senate Democrats opposed President Donald Trump’s $5.7 billion request for building a wall on the southern border.\n\nBefore that, the longest government shutdown lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and John Fritze\n\nMoody's says a government shutdown could hurt U.S. credit rating\n\nThe country’s credit rating could face additional pressure if the government shuts down next week, according to a new report from Moody’s Investors Service.\n\nWhile a short-lived shutdown would not impact government debt service payments and isn’t expected to disrupt the economy, Moody's said it would “underscore the weakness” of U.S. institutional and governance strength compared to countries with similar credit ratings.\n\n“In particular, it would demonstrate the significant constraints that intensifying political polarization put on fiscal policymaking at a time of declining fiscal strength,” Moody's report reads.\n\nIf the potential shutdown does drag on, it would \"likely be disruptive both to the US economy and financial markets,\" although Moody's notes that any government shutdown is more likely to be brief and concentrated in areas with a large government presence, like Washington, D.C.\n\n− Bailey Schulz\n\nWould a government shutdown impact travel?\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nImpacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.\n\nConsular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”\n\nThere could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for Medicare?\n\nMedicare benefits will continue, though there could be a delay in some payments.\n\nThe benefits are considered among essential services, along with U.S. mail delivery, air travel, Amtrak, Social Security payments and more.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nWhat agencies are affected by a government shutdown?\n\nAll agencies could be affected by a government shutdown.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Agriculture, each agency will have a plan to stop its nonessential functions, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nAgencies also rely on each other during a shutdown. For example, the State Department’s U.S. Passport Agency will remain open during a government shutdown, so you should be able to get a passport if you need one. But if passport services are offered in a building near you that’s run by an agency that has shut down, you could have to look elsewhere.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect federal retirees?\n\nA government shutdown would have major consequences for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, but federal retirees will receive payments if lawmakers fail to keep the government open.\n\nThese retirement payments are one of several functions that won’t stop during a government shutdown, alongside Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nEmployees ranging from air traffic controllers to emergency personnel in national parks will also stay on the job, whether or not the government shuts down.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat will not be impacted by a government shutdown?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and members of Congress will continue to work and get paid, but their staff members who aren’t considered “essential” will be furloughed. The Supreme Court will also stay open, but federal courts could have to scale back functionality.\n\nBut what does essential mean? Think employees such as air traffic controllers and law enforcement officers. U.S. embassies and consulates would likely stay open, and you should still be able to get a passport and visa.\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Washington D.C. or a National Park, monuments and other areas will likely stay open. However, maintenance of those areas may be delayed or canceled altogether.\n\nAnd as the holidays approach, a government shutdown also likely won't impact NORAD's beloved Santa Tracker.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill a government shutdown affect state employees?\n\nA shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.\n\nIn this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.\n\nBut state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/30/government-shutdown-live-updates-how-affects-you/71016245007/", "title": "Shutdown averted: Congress passes short-term solution with hours ...", "text": "WASHINGTON−Crisis averted.

Both chambers have to pass the same agreement to avoid a government shutdown, with the same details to keep funding flowing.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long is the government funded?\n\nLawmakers on Saturday passed a continuing resolution, which is a temporary funding plan that buys lawmakers more time to negotiate spending legislation for the country.\n\nThe continuing resolution House lawmakers passed keeps the government funded for another 45 days. While the Senate hasn’t voted on the legislation yet, they’re expected to take it up Saturday evening.\n\nIf at the end of that 45-day period Congress hasn’t come up with another temporary solution, or actually approved the dozen spending bills that would grant the government longer-term funding, the nation will be facing another government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHouse Democrats take victory lap after chamber passes 45-day, short-term funding measure\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., celebrated the passage of the 45-day, short-term measure that will keep the government funded at current levels, saying “the extreme MAGA Republicans have lost.”\n\n“The American people have won. The extreme MAGA Republicans have lost,” Jeffries said at a press conference. “It was a victory for the American people and a complete and total surrender by right-wing extremists who throughout the year have attempted to hijack the Congress.”\n\nHouse Minority Whip, Rep.

The funding package includes President Joe Biden’s request for $16 billion in additional disaster relief funding, but omits his request for more U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe bill, which had to pass with two-thirds of the chamber, earned bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhile it is unclear if the Senate will approve the measure, the stopgap marks a significant shift in strategy from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to cooperate with Democrats, after his previous insistence on passing a stopgap bill along party-lines.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats: 'I think we won'\n\nHouse Democrats are largely expected to support a temporary measure to keep the government open with funding at current levels. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told reporters before entering the chamber that the stopgap \"is a bill that Democrats can support.\"While GOP lawmakers were consumed by infighting, House Democrats repeatedly urged House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to put the short-term deal on the floor. The 45-day extension, McGovern said, is a sign Democrats \"won.\"– Ken Tran\n\nHouse begins vote on stopgap measure\n\nHouse lawmakers are now voting on the 45-day short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open.If passed, the Senate will have to take up the bill and vote on it to avert a shutdown.– Ken Tran\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy before government shuts down\n\nThe White House said Friday that President Joe Biden will not meet with McCarthy to negotiate a deal before the government shuts down, demanding that House Republicans act to avoid a crisis of their making.\n\n“The conversation that needs to happen is between speaker McCarthy and his caucus,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nBiden plans to spend the weekend in Washington and will be in touch with members of Congress, the White House said.

Spanning from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019, it is also the most recent federal shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was the third federal shutdown to occur during former President Donald Trump's administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n− Olivia Munson\n\nDemocrats on Senate floor urge colleagues to prevent shutdown, stand with Ukraine\n\nSen.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., also urged her colleagues to keep moving the Senate’s bipartisan continuing resolution forward.\n\nThe shutdown “will hurt our families. It will hurt our economy. And it will hurt our national security,” Murray warned.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHouse Democrats continue to stall vote to read through temporary measure\n\nIn a bid to buy more time for House Democrats to read a 71-page stopgap measure proposed by House Republicans to keep the government runing, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is using what is referred to as a \"magic minute\" to delay the vote.Under House rules, leadership is able to speak for an unlimited amount of time.

While schools across the country do receive some federal funding, the vast majority of their budgets come from their state and local governments.\n\nSchools that do use federal funding have mostly already received money for the 2023-2024 school year, Education Week reported.\n\nBut some programs for kids would be hit by a government shutdown. For example, Children from low-income families could lose access to Head Start preschool programs.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nLatest updates on government shutdown: McCarthy blames Dems\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Saturday afternoon said he's going to be \"the adult in the room,\" immediately pointing the finger at Senate Democrats, the White House and hardline House conservatives like Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., for why the shutdown threat continues.\n\nHe said the House is moving a 45-day continuing resolution that would keep troops paid, the Federal Aviation Administration funded and pay for disaster relief in Maui and elsewhere.\n\nAs House Democrats asked for more time to consider that bill, McCarthy questioned whether President Joe Biden and the White House are urging House Democrats to vote for or against the short-term spending measure.\n\nThe Senate, McCarthy said, has not done its work.

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., leaving a closed-door conference meeting Saturday morning, told reporters there are a handful of hardline conservatives who won't vote for a stopgap measure under any circumstances. The focus now, he said, is to mitigate the effects of a shutdown.House Republicans will look at what is \"passable\" on the floor, suggesting the House will vote to sustain troop pay and reauthorization for the Federal Aviation Agency first.\"It is our obligation to anticipate and do whatever we can to mitigate it,\" Issa said.– Ken Tran\n\nWhat causes a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown takes place when Congress is unable to pass a dozen annual spending bills that funnel money to government programs and agencies.\n\nA shutdown is likely when both chambers in Congress − the House and Senate − can’t come to an agreement on how much money to allocate to certain agencies or agree on certain spending provisions, putting federal agencies at risk. A partial government shutdown can occur if Congress is able to pass any of the 12 individual spending bills.\n\nWhen both chambers can't reach a compromise, funding levels expire and federal agencies must cease all non-essential function.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nWho is causing the government shutdown?\n\nThe biggest fight comes from a small group of House conservatives who have been impeding nearly all progress toward funding the government.\n\nThese House conservatives make up a small portion of the House GOP conference and represent a sliver of the country, but they have outsized power because of the razor-thin House Republican majority. The GOP has a four-seat majority, and these hard-line conservatives have been leveraging their critical votes to extract deep spending cuts that won't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate − or even some moderate GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe most vocal of this handful is Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who has threatened to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., if he works with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution that would avert a shutdown and give lawmakers extra time to pass spending bills.\n\nTheir refusal to entertain anything less than their demands has embroiled the House in chaos for the last few weeks.\n\n−Ken Tran and Rachel Looker\n\nWhen will the government shutdown start?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWould a government shutdown affect air travel and TSA?\n\nFlights will likely not be affected by a shutdown and TSA screenings should proceed normally. Transportation Security Administration agents and air traffic controllers are considered essential and will continue working, though they won’t be paid.\n\nHowever, during the 2019 shutdown, air traffic controllers started calling in sick at higher rates which might occur again this time around. The White House warned that a shutdown could risk delays for travelers.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also said in a press conference that air traffic controller hiring and training would be paused, which would impact the Department of Transportation’s efforts to address a shortfall in staffing.\n\n−Zach Wichter and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Social Security be paid during a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Yosemite or other national parks close if there is a government shutdown?\n\nThe Biden administration said Friday it will be forced to close the majority of national parks if the government shuts down at the end of the week resulting in funding to lapse.\n\n“Gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed” at national parks across the country, the Interior Department said in a statement. The public will be encouraged not to visit park sites during a shutdown.\n\nThe National Mall in Washington, Washington Monument and other park sites that are “physically accessible” to the public will remain accessible but staffing will vary site to site and not be guaranteed.\n\nThe National Park System has 425 individual sites that includes 63 national parks made up of iconic landmarks like the Grand Canyon National Park, Everglades National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\n\nMillions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.\n\nFederal workers would be furloughed without pay. \"Essential\" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends.

Chip Roy., R-Texas, one of the House’s ultraconservatives but a key negotiator who has attempted to bridge the gap between moderate GOP lawmakers and the hard-right, lambasted his fellow conservatives for taking down the stopgap bill.\n\n“We could have had time to get votes on more individual appropriation bills, passing a bill that secures the border,” a frustrated Roy told reporters Friday, referring to the border security provisions in the stopgap that failed. “But apparently that wasn’t good enough.”\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nPresident Biden won’t meet with McCarthy before government shuts down\n\nThe White House said Friday that President Joe Biden will not meet with McCarthy to negotiate a deal before the government shuts down, demanding that House Republicans act to avoid a crisis of their making.\n\n“The conversation that needs to happen is between speaker McCarthy and his caucus,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nBiden plans to spend the weekend in Washington and will be in touch with members of Congress, the White House said. The House voted Friday afternoon to defeat a resolution backed by hardline Republicans to keep the government operating for 30 days in exchange for 30% cuts that the White House warned would be “devastating.”\n\n−Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nOMB Director Shalanda Young blasts McCarthy for imminent shutdown\n\nShalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, accused McCarthy and House Republicans - by pursuing major spending cuts - of reneging on a bipartisan deal that passed Congress by wide margins in June to raise the debt ceiling and set spending limits.\n\nYoung said 30% cuts to many domestic services would eliminate 12,000 FBI agents, 1,000 ATF agents, 500 local law enforcement official and cut 300,000 children from the federal Head Start program and 1 million seniors from nutrition services. If a measure isn’t passed, the alternative is a potential cropping shutdown.\n\n“What kind of choice is that?” Young said. “We're doing everything we can to plead, beg, shame House Republicans to do the right thing. Don’t have this happen.”\n\nYoung also chastised McCarthy saying he won’t accept a paycheck during a shutdown \"political theater\" because members of Congress must get paid under the Constitution.\n\n\"Maybe he'll put it in a sock drawer, I don't know,\" she said. \"I will tell you the guy who picks up trash in my office won't get a paycheck That's real. And that's what makes me angry.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nModerates try to avert shutdown: ‘We’ll do what we need to do’\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, a group evenly divided between centrist Democrats and Republicans, told reporters Friday that his coalition of lawmakers is looking to force a bipartisan solution on the floor to avert a shutdown.\n\nThe group, which includes 31 Republicans, has been privately discussing a fallback plan if Congress fails to pass a funding package to avoid a shutdown. The plan would effectively sidestep House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as speaker and force a vote on the House floor without the speaker’s approval. The archaic process, referred to as a discharge petition, would need the support of 218 members.\n\n“We gotta find a way to get the two-party bill on the floor. And we’ll see if it happens on its own. If it doesn’t, we’ll do what we need to do,” Fitzpatrick said.\n\nWhen asked if their bipartisan solution would be on the floor by the Sept. 30 deadline, Fitzpatrick said “we’ll find out.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHow long was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n−Olivia Munson\n\nHow long do government shutdowns last?\n\nOver the last five decades, there have been 21 federal shutdowns:\n\n1976 : Under President Gerald Ford.

A partial government shutdown can occur if Congress is able to pass any of the 12 individual spending bills.\n\nWhen both chambers can't reach a compromise, funding levels expire and federal agencies must cease all non-essential function.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nWill Social Security be paid if there's a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill a government shutdown affect Medicare?\n\nMedicare benefits will continue, though there could be a delay in some payments.\n\nThe benefits are considered among essential services, along with air travel, Amtrak, Social Security payments and more.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nShort-term funding bill: What is a continuing resolution?\n\nThe House on Friday failed to pass a continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would buy time − 30 days − for Congress to do its main job of passing spending bills without a shutdown. But members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus voted against it.\n\nA Senate version of a continuing resolution will be up for a vote Saturday. It would give Congress until Nov. 17 to pass spending bills. But the Senate's bipartisan plan won't pass the House.\n\nLawmakers are no closer to averting a government shutdown.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nWill mail be delivered in a government shutdown?\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nHow does the government shutdown affect me?\n\nMillions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.\n\nFederal workers would be furloughed without pay. \"Essential\" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends. Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.\n\nThe impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\nAgencies that publish government data, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, will close up shop. That means investors and other market-watchers might not get to see the jobs report scheduled for October 6 or the monthly Consumer Price Index update on October 12\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission would scale back operations, potentially delaying work on initial public offerings, which require federal scrutiny. Birkenstock, the sandal brand, has signaled it expects to proceed with its October IPO\n\n−Candy Woodall and Daniel de Vise\n\nWill passports be affected in a government shutdown?\n\nThe State Department wrote in its contingency plan that scheduled passports and visa services in the U.S. and at U.S. embassies and consulates will continue during a shutdown “as the situation permits.”\n\nHowever, the department did warn that if a passport agency in a government building becomes affected by the shutdown, “the facility may become unsupported.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNational parks to close if government shuts down\n\nThe Biden administration said Friday it will be forced to close the majority of national parks if the government shuts down at the end of the week resulting in funding to lapse.\n\n“Gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed” at national parks across the country, the Interior Department said in a statement. The public will be encouraged not to visit park sites during a shutdown.\n\nThe National Mall in Washington, Washington Monument and other park sites that are “physically accessible” to the public will remain accessible but staffing will vary site to site and not be guaranteed.\n\nThe National Park System has 425 individual sites that includes 63 national parks made up of iconic landmarks like the Grand Canyon National Park, Everglades National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nNo Fat Bear Week in a shutdown\n\nThe National Park Service’s annual tournament was slated to begin next Wednesday. But in a government shutdown during which only essential employees charged with protecting park resources and providing safety assistance stay on the job, there would be no staff to run Fat Bear Week online.\n\nFat Bear Week is a bracket-style competition and decade-long annual tradition to crown people’s favorite fat bear in Katmai National Park and Preserve.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nDianne Feinstein death comes just 36 hours before government shutdown\n\nThis week on Capitol Hill has brought a looming government shutdown, an impeachment inquiry hearing into President Joe Biden, a senator’s indictment and a senator’s death – all happening in the last five days.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s death falls just 36 hours before funding for federal agencies and programs is set to expire. The final countdown is on for lawmakers in both chambers to try to pass a stopgap measure that would avert a government shutdown, but odds aren't in their favor.\n\nIn what has become Feinstein's last vote on the Senate floor, the longest-serving female senator voted for the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act, which is being used as the legislative vehicle to pass the Senate’s continuing resolution -- or stopgap measure -- that would avert a shutdown.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nLatest news on the government shutdown\n\nWith just one day before the Sept. 30 funding deadline, McCarthy sought to lay the blame of a shutdown at the feet of Democrats and the White House for refusing to entertain the border security provisions House Republicans have been pushing for.\n\nMcCarthy scoffed at the notion of agreeing to the Senate’s bipartisan version of a stopgap measure to keep the government open, saying at a press conference he won’t “surrender.”\n\n“If you want to fight for the American public, to secure our borders and keep government open, how is that a problem?” McCarthy said. “What I want to do is stand for America.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill military get paid in a government shutdown?\n\nMilitary officials prepared Friday to cut pay for troops and civilians, and close offices and activities deemed not essential to national security as the deadline nears for the government shutdown that is expected to begin at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.\n\nTroops will remain deployed to hotspots around the world, and civilians in critical chair-borne commands at the Pentagon and elsewhere will remain on job. But none will be paid unless an agreement on government spending or legislation authorizing military pay is reached.\n\n“If there is a shutdown in just a few days, our service members would be required to continue working but would be doing so without pay, and hundreds and thousands of their civilian colleagues would be furloughed,” Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, told reporters Thursday. “A government shutdown is a worst-case scenario for the department, so we continue to ask Congress to do its job and fund the government.”\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden said it would be a \"disgrace\" to have unpaid troops in a shutdown\n\nPresident Joe Biden briefly weighed in on the looming government shutdown during a Friday retirement ceremony for Army Gen. Mark Milley, outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nHe said the shutdown and its attendant failure to pay troops would be a “disgrace.”\n\n“We can’t be playing politics while our troops stand in the breach,” Biden said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nClose, but no cigar: House passes 3 spending bills\n\nThe House passed three individual spending bills late Thursday evening. While it may seem like progress, the passage does not bring Congress any closer to averting a shutdown.\n\nHouse Republicans voted on four individual spending bills. The lower chamber passed the Defense, Homeland Security and Department of State and Foreign Operations bills, but failed to pass one on Agriculture spending.\n\nEarlier this summer, the lower chamber passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act which brings the grand total of spending bills passed in the House to four out of 12 total hours before the government will shutdown.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nWhile a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.\n\nIt's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”\n\nWhile the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a \"lot of other items going on\" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n“We're in a very volatile time now,\" Silverblatt said.\n\n− Bailey Schulz and Daniel de Vise", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/10/debt-limit-fight-social-security-checks/70194085007/", "title": "Debt limit fight: Here's how it could impact Social Security checks", "text": "WASHINGTON−Like dueling pianos, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy simultaneously stood in front of microphones Tuesday evening − with one at the White House and the other at the Capitol − to blame each other and their opposing political parties for why the country could run out of money to pay its bills for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nWhile they made their jabs, the health and financial security of millions of Americans across the country remained at risk. Though getting Republicans and Democrats to agree on financial aid is never a simple task, the side effect of the standoff is clear: U.S. residents who rely on government payments for their salaries, retirement money, food assistance, medical care and more would lose those benefits if the nation doesn't have money to cover its obligations.\n\nThe Tuesday news conferences didn't solve that problem. They did little more than prove Biden, McCarthy and other top congressional leaders made little progress during their Oval Office meeting that afternoon. McCarthy said there was no movement toward a solution and the only real sign of progress was they met for the first time in 97 days.\n\nThey met to rev up negotiations and spare the nation from defaulting on its obligations − something that has never happened in America but could happen this year as soon as June 1, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nThe meeting:Biden, McCarthy fail to reach a debt ceiling deal in Oval Office meeting as default looms\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSocial Security payments at risk in July\n\nIf the country's top leaders don't reach an agreement to raise the nation's borrowing limit and her predictions come true, it would lead to catastrophic and devastating effects across the country, Yellen, Treasury secretaries before her and multiple economists agree.\n\nOne of the biggest impacts would be to Social Security. The program, which millions of Americans rely on for money in retirement, is often seen by politicians as the untouchable vanguard of government aid, but it has been the subject of fierce debate between Republicans and Democrats in the 118th Congress. If the debt ceiling isn't raised by the projected default date in June, the July Social Security benefits would be in jeopardy.\n\nWith three weeks until June 1 − during which both chambers of Congress are in session for just 10 days − Yellen has been emphasizing the \"economic calamity\" that could result without a debt limit increase.\n\n\"Whether it's defaulting on interest payments that are due on the debt or payments due for Social Security recipients or to Medicare providers, we would simply not have enough cash to meet all of our obligations,\" she said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And it's widely agreed that financial and economic chaos would ensue.\"\n\nWhat to know:Planning for retirement? 3 harsh Social Security truths to consider.\n\nAre Social Security benefits really at risk in default?\n\nSome economists have said Social Security payments might be delayed or disrupted at most, and some have said they wouldn't be impacted at all.\n\nDespite some talk on Capitol Hill that the government could or would somehow prioritize payments in a default so seniors and veterans are taken care of, Yellen has said there is no plan for that.\n\nAlso, because the government has never defaulted on its obligations, there's no clear roadmap for what would happen and U.S. systems have not been tested operationally in a scenario like that.\n\nDuring a Senate Appropriations hearing on March 22, Yellen said her job as Treasury secretary is to make sure all the bills are paid, not to decide which bills are more important than others.\n\n\"Prioritization is default by another name,\" she said. \"Not paying any of our bills is default. When you think about the pain that it would cause to Social Security recipients, to food stamp recipients, to vendors who have supplied services, to the government who have their own payrolls to meet, to be told they are not going to be paid, the government is not going to honor those bills. That’s a default.\"\n\nThe government pays millions of bills a day and its payment systems are set up to pay all the government’s bills when they come due. \"They are not setup to divide payments into different types as a general matter,\" Yellen said.\n\n\"For many agencies, payments of all different types are mixed together in ways that couldn’t be disentangled,\" she added.\n\nPoll:As Social Security and Medicare face shortfalls, most Americans oppose cutting their benefits\n\nWhen are Biden and McCarthy meeting again about the debt ceiling?\n\nTop congressional aides will continue to meet with White House officials through the week, and Biden and McCarthy are set to meet again Friday.\n\nRepublicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling without federal spending cuts in exchange. Democrats say the nation's borrowing limit should be raised without conditions and federal spending negotiations should happen separately.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers who represent states with the most Social Security recipients, such as McCarthy's home state of California, are raising concerns and blasting the House GOP proposal that passed April 26 and would raise the debt ceiling while cutting trillions in federal spending.\n\nWhat Democrats are telling USA TODAY\n\nAbout 66 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, federal data shows. Payments are made not only to people of retirement age, but also millions of children and others with severe disabilities.\n\nMcCarthy's home state of California has the most Social Security recipients in the country, with more than 6 million residents receiving the benefit, according to federal data. It is also the state with the highest population. More than 15 million people there receive Medicaid and about 4.5 million receive Medicare − the most of any state.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told USA TODAY Republicans are using a potential default as leverage to try and force cuts \"their members would never actually vote for as standalone bills because of the public backlash they would face.\"\n\nCuts to critical programs like food assistance, Medicaid and more \"would be devastating to the people in my district and across the country who rely on these programs to get by,\" he said. \"We have to first pay our bills and then we can rationally discuss deficit reduction.\"\n\nImpact:'I don't have anything in my refrigerator': GOP debt ceiling plan would cut SNAP benefits\n\nNearly 3 million Pennsylvanians receive Social Security benefits. Nearly 3 million are on Medicare, and nearly 4 million are on Medicaid, according to federal data.\n\n\"If the debt ceiling is not raised in time, then Social Security and Medicare payments will be late. Veterans benefits will be impacted as well. The MAGA Republicans are jeopardizing the livelihoods of seniors and veterans with their antics,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., told USA TODAY. He is the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.\n\nAnother Pennsylvania Democrat, Sen. Bob Casey, told USA TODAY in a statement, \"Make no mistake: House Republicans are trying to take away health care for seniors, children, and people with disabilities. Avoiding default cannot and will not come at the expense of ripping health care coverage away from millions of Pennsylvanians. I will fight to protect Medicaid any way I have to.\"\n\nIn Illinois, more than 2 million people receive Social Security. More than 3 million receive Medicaid, and more than 2 million receive Medicare.\n\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., described during floor remarks how a GOP debt plan would also impact other programs in Illinois: “The Republican proposal would force 13,000 children in our state to lose child care and preschool. It would strip food assistance from 55,000 women, infants, and children. Does that make any sense at all? And it would threaten medical care for more than 186,000 veterans in Illinois. Fifty thousand seniors would lose their meals on wheels in my state.”\n\nWhat Republicans are telling USA TODAY\n\nMcCarthy on Tuesday said it was \"a lie\" that the GOP proposal would cut veterans' care, and he and other Republicans have recently blamed Biden and Democrats for any risk to Social Security. He maintained Tuesday that House Republicans \"are the only ones in Washington who have passed a responsible debt limit increase that avoids default.\"\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by other Republicans on the Hill in the last week.\n\n\"The Biden administration might want to look in the mirror and realize they’re the ones threatening a default that would jeopardize these programs. Biden has House Republicans’ solution in front of him – the only bill passed that takes a default off the table and protects Social Security – but he’d rather bankrupt our nation than negotiate,\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer's office told USA TODAY.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., told USA TODAY in a statement: “President Biden has avoided negotiations on the debt ceiling for more than 90 days – his delay tactics have put our seniors directly in harms way. Republicans worked diligently to pass a plan that addresses our spending crisis and the debt limit, the president needs to take our plan seriously.”\n\nSome Republican senators say they want to see more negotiations.\n\n\"I hope the president negotiates. He sold himself to the American people as a negotiator. So, what is negotiation? You’ve got to give and get,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told USA TODAY before Biden met with congressional leaders.\n\nCapito said she hoped the meeting with the president would be more than a photo opportunity. \"It better be substantive,\" she said. \"He better come back with items that he thinks he could live with and that the House would pass.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said he was hoping for a compromise.\n\n\"We certainly want to raise the debt ceiling. At the same time we’d like to deal with the excessive spending and debt burden the country is facing, so let’s get them both dealt with,\" he said.\n\nA deeper look:Joe Biden boxes Republicans into a corner on Social Security, Medicare with an eye on 2024", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/government-shutdown-2023/70480762007/", "title": "Government shutdown 2023: What Congress is saying about ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Congress is out for its August recess but lawmakers will have a monumental task ahead of them when they return to Washington in September – funding the federal government.\n\nOnce lawmakers get back to Capitol Hill in mid-September, the House and Senate will be in session for roughly three weeks until the Sep. 30 deadline to pass a federal budget. On Oct. 1, a new fiscal year begins. If lawmakers cannot push through 11 out of 12 separate spending bills, after passing just one before the August recess, the country will face a government shutdown.\n\nHowever, lawmakers could pass a continuing resolution, which would avert a shutdown and fund the government at current levels until an agreed upon date.\n\nBut with a deeply divided Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate, it is unclear whether lawmakers can avert a shutdown in time. The outcome is even murkier with some Republicans from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative lawmakers, either openly welcoming a shutdown or dismissing concerns about one.\n\n“We should not fear a government shutdown,\" Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., a member of the Freedom Caucus said at a press conference last week. \"Most of the American people won't even miss if the government is shut down temporarily.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere's how lawmakers are progressing in funding talks and how a government shutdown could affect you.\n\nWhat are House lawmakers fighting about?\n\nThe major fight on government spending is happening in the House, where Republicans hold a slim five-seat majority.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus have been demanding deeper cuts across the board from House GOP leadership after the debt ceiling negotiations between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., and President Joe Biden. Hardline conservatives felt like they were left out of those conversations.\n\n“We gave up all that leverage,” Good told reporters last week about the debt ceiling negotiations. With the funding debate coming up in September, Good urged his colleagues to leverage a shutdown.\n\n“If (a government shutdown) is a requirement to break bad habits, so be it. And this town has a bad habits problem,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., another member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters last Tuesday.\n\nAnother sticking point for House conservatives is their insistence on leadership to vote on 12 separate bills funding the government as opposed to one large “omnibus” spending bill, a practice Congress has become accustomed to over past years. Voting on the 12 separate bills was a key concession McCarthy made to Freedom Caucus members in his pursuit of the speakership back in January − a position he won after 15 historic rounds of voting.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mo., another member of the Freedom Caucus, said he will refuse to approve any funding legislation until all 12 bills are moved out of committee so he can see the total cost of spending.\n\nWill Congress take steps to buy more time?\n\nOne option if Congress cannot come to a deal before Sep. 30 is to pass a continuing resolution, which will keep funding at or close to current levels to buy lawmakers more time at the negotiating table.\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., a key GOP leadership ally and negotiator during the debt ceiling discussions, said last Wednesday he would only consider a continuing resolution for a “limited time.”\n\n“It’s not my first preference,” Graves told USA TODAY, adding a continuing resolution would extend Democratic policies from last year's spending bill when Democrats still controlled the House which he said was not “in our interest.”\n\nEven then, it is uncertain whether a continuing resolution could pass. Some members from the House Freedom Caucus, including Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., have said they have no plans to support a continuing resolution. Other lawmakers, when asked, have avoided discussing the idea.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said lawmakers from both the House and Senate should start negotiations during the August recess to beat the Sep. 30 deadline.\n\n“We can be starting those negotiations over the August work period and then come back in September to finish what’s left,” he said during a press conference last week.\n\nWhat can pass in both chambers?\n\nHouse Republicans have been pushing through a litany of amendments with deeper spending cuts related to conservative culture wars, such as limiting abortion access for service members and blocking the VA from displaying pride flags.\n\nThe ambitious policy changes have little to no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. The White House has already issued a veto threat for one appropriations bill the House passed along party line votes last Thursday.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told USA TODAY Democrats won’t support spending bills if Republicans “put cultural stuff in there.”\n\n“They know that and they will be perceived as responsible for shutting down the government, which I think hurts them politically,” Hoyer said.\n\nHe added that a government shutdown is \"not just bad policy, it's stupid.\"\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the country could see a shutdown because of the far-right GOP, adding that many amendments they are pushing for are stripping freedoms away from Americans.\n\n\"It's offensive,\" she said. \"It is not what the American people need and they have no interest in trying to legislate for what we actually need to do in this body.\"\n\nMcCarthy has dismissed concerns that the House’s spending plans have no chance in the Senate, telling reporters before the August recess that he met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to begin negotiations early to avoid a shutdown.\n\nWhat does a government shutdown do?\n\nIf the government shuts down, you can expect various government functions to slow down.\n\nBut every shutdown slightly differs. The Office and Management and Budget coordinates plans for a shutdown developed by each federal agency. These plans are updated on a rolling basis.\n\nThe OMB tells the agencies what functions must continue under certain exceptions, such as being considered essential or being a program that does not require annual authorization from Congress.\n\nFederal employees who do not work in services considered essential are prevented from doing their jobs and those who are considered essential see their paychecks paused. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, around 800,000 federal employees were either furloughed or working without pay. After the shutdown ends, those employees receive retroactive pay for the length of the shutdown.\n\nSome of the services considered essential include flights, border patrol, Social Security and Medicare benefits. Workers involved in those services, such as air traffic controllers, work without pay.\n\nBut even those essential services could be impacted by a shutdown as well. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days and was the longest shutdown, some TSA agents and air traffic controllers were unable to work due to financial limitations, resulting in crowded airports, flight delays and terminal closures.\n\nAmong other ways a shutdown could affect you:\n\nNational parks: Some national parks might close and others could offer limited services.\n\nSome national parks might close and others could offer limited services.

Heading into September, it is unclear what the main point of contention will be in Congress.\n\nDec. 2018 - Jan. 2019: This was the longest government shutdown in the history of the U.S., lasting 35 days. Former President Donald Trump pushed for funding for construction of a wall on the southern border but Democratic lawmakers refused to support any spending bill with provisions for a wall. Trump ultimately declared a national emergency to bypass Congress and finance the wall.\n\nThis was the longest government shutdown in the history of the U.S., lasting 35 days.

Democratic lawmakers attempted to pressure Trump to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The shutdown was resolved after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised Democrats to continue negotiations and hold a floor vote on immigration reform.\n\nThe government shut down for three days.

The shutdown was resolved after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised Democrats to continue negotiations and hold a floor vote on immigration reform. Oct. 2013: The government shut down for 17 days. Republican lawmakers, who were heavily opposed to former President Barack Obama's then-new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, attempted to delay the implementation of the legislation. GOP leadership ultimately backed away from its fight as the shutdown progressed.\n\nIn the Senate, 'cooler heads will prevail'\n\nSeveral senators from both sides of the aisle, however, told USA TODAY they do not think a government shutdown is likely.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said there are “zero” chances of a shutdown.\n\n“We did a bill a couple of years back that guarantees all federal employees get paid if there’s a shutdown,” Kaine said. “So why would you shut the door and still pay people to not come into the office and serve their fellow Americans?”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she is “not planning on a government shutdown.”\n\n“Won’t happen,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “I don’t think anybody benefits from a government shutdown.”\n\n“Cooler heads will prevail,” he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/15/legislative-outlook-6-priorities-iowa-gop-push-democrats-fight/95387054/", "title": "6 priorities Iowa GOP will push, Democrats will fight this session", "text": "Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nbpfannenst@dmreg.com\n\nRiding high after a wave election that granted them total control of the state Legislature, Iowa Republicans now face delivering on the promises they made to voters.\n\nLawmakers from both parties return to the state Capitol on Jan. 9 to kick off the 2017 General Assembly, and Republican leaders have already begun to refine a policy agenda that will shape the session.\n\nIowans can expect pitched debates and fierce Democratic resistance to most GOP priorities. But with control of the governor's office, House and Senate for the first time in nearly 20 years, Republicans hold the power to remake Iowa government as they see fit.\n\nHow to engage with the 2017 Iowa Legislature\n\nHigh-interest issues such as a statewide minimum wage, expanding medical cannabis access, legalizing fireworks and banning sanctuary cities will undoubtedly take up legislative bandwidth. But Republican lawmakers pledge to remain focused on a set of high-level conservative priorities that, until now, have been out of their reach.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"We’re going to move the things that our entire caucus thinks is important, and not just this agenda where everyone wants to get a little piece of the pie,\" said Sen. Dan Zumbach, R-Ryan. \"So I see us really trying to say, 'These are our priorities, let’s get these things done.' Then we can work on the (lesser) ones later on.\"\n\nBlunting some of their excitement: Monday's report from the state Revenue Estimating Conference showed that a decline in projected state tax revenue will force $100 million in spending cuts for the current state fiscal year. Revenue is expected to grow going into the next budget year, though at a slower pace than analysts originally anticipated.\n\nDemocrats already have blasted Republican leaders for favoring corporate and other tax incentives that deplete state revenue. But they also acknowledge they hold little bargaining power this session to mitigate Republican advances if they choose to double down on those priorities.\n\n\"On the Democratic side, we won’t have the votes to be able to stop anything they want to do,\" Senate Minority Leader Rob Hogg, D-Cedar Rapids, said at a recent legislative panel hosted by the Greater Des Moines Partnership.\n\nIowa City debate prompts renewed focus on 'sanctuary city' legislation\n\n\"I hope they choose to govern wisely. And I say that even if that means it’s harder for us to take back the majority in 2018,\" he said. \"We have things that Iowans have assumed would be there for decades that could be at risk. And if those things start to happen, we will speak up and stand up and we’ll say what we can. But at the end of the day, Republicans get to do anything they want to do.\"\n\nHere's a look at six of the top issues that lawmakers, advocacy groups and lobbyists say Republicans will pursue in 2017.\n\nPlanned Parenthood plots strategy to avert defunding in Iowa\n\nTax reform\n\nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate want to make tax reform a top priority, though they acknowledge it will be difficult in a tight budget year. The primary objective, as it has been in the past, is to maintain a balanced budget, they’ve said.\n\nNew Senate President Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny, said at the Greater Des Moines Partnership panel that Senate Republicans plan to introduce legislation reducing income taxes.\n\n“If you look around the country, the states that are growing the fastest are the ones that have reduced or no income tax,” he said. “I’m not sitting here today saying we’re going to eliminate the income tax. But I will say that we will have a bill to address individual income tax this year.”\n\nDemocrats warn that reducing income taxes would leave too little revenue for vital services such as education. And tax cuts would require reductions in other areas to achieve a balanced budget.\n\nTo help free up revenue, Rep. Jo Oldson, D-Des Moines, said she’s open to reviewing tax credits and eliminating those that are no longer necessary.\n\n“Tax credits have become one of the fastest-growing areas in our state spending,” she said, speaking at the same panel. “… We need to make sure that we review those tax credits and make sure … that they’re doing what the legislation initially said they needed to do.”\n\nAlso on the table is instituting permanent “coupling” with the federal tax code. The federal government allows qualifying farmers and business owners to deduct as much as $500,000 in certain expenses from their federal tax burden. Coupling at the state level would allow Iowans to make that same deduction on their state taxes.\n\nThat process, again, comes as a hit to the state’s budget. Last year, Gov. Terry Branstad did not include coupling in his budget recommendations, though he eventually signed a bill allowing it for a single year.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimated the result was a $97.6 million reduction to the state general fund in the 2016 budget year.\n\nJeff Robinson, an agency analyst, said permanent coupling would likely mean a $70 million to $80 million reduction each year for a change that the Department of Revenue estimates would benefit about 66,600 Iowa taxpayers annually.\n\nHouse Speaker Linda Upmeyer, R-Clear Lake, told reporters recently that reducing taxes in whatever form has always been a priority for state Republicans.\n\n“We’re very interested in taking a look at taxes in any ways that we can make it simpler, more streamlined, perhaps fairer,” she said. “ … This is a tough year to look at when you’ve got declining revenue. Again, at the same time, we don’t want to ignore the opportunity. We’re going to look, study, see what’s possible.”\n\nSchool funding, choice\n\nDuring recent sessions, the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-led Senate played political football with the issue of school funding — bouncing bills between the two chambers as they fought for months over how much to increase base state aid to schools.\n\nBy law, the Legislature is supposed to set that figure early in the session and two years in advance. But it often was among the final major issues negotiated between the parties during the end-of-session budget process.\n\nThat ends this year, Upmeyer said. Iowa schools should expect to know the base level of funding within the first 30 days of the session, she said.\n\nOnce that issue is settled, it frees the Legislature to address other education efforts, such as giving schools more flexibility in the way they’re allowed to use some state dollars that are limited to certain categories of spending.\n\n“There’s money sitting in accounts that maybe one school needs, another school needs something different,” Upmeyer told The Des Moines Register. “So I think it would be a good thing to take a look at some of those, see if we can be helpful there and release some of that and (return) control to school boards.”\n\nShe cited as one example a bill introduced during the previous legislative session that would have expanded the uses for which schools could use their professional development dollars, allowing the money instead to pay for things such as textbooks.\n\nAlso on the horizon is an extension of the statewide penny sales tax, known as SAVE, which expires in 2029. The revenue pays for infrastructure and technology projects. Lawmakers will take another look at whether and how those dollars should be re-allotted to districts, said Rep. Matt Windschitl, R-Missouri Valley and House speaker pro tem.\n\nTrish Wilger, executive director of the Iowa Alliance for Choice in Education, said she sees \"the best possibility that we’ve had in 10 years\" for advancing stronger school choice language. She said her organization will push for creating education savings accounts so state tax dollars can follow students who do not attend public schools. Wilger said the accounts could pay for tuition at private schools, homeschooling costs, virtual education or tutors.\n\n“We’d like to see all parents in the position to be able to choose the choice that best fits their child’s needs,” she said.\n\nWilger also envisions an expansion of the school tuition organization tax credits, which allow individuals and businesses to claim an exemption for donating to a fund that pays for scholarships for low-income students who want to attend accredited nonpublic schools.\n\nIn 2015, nearly 4,000 people claimed those credits, helping to provide scholarships to 10,848 students, according to the Department of Revenue. The credits currently are capped at $12 million, and they were maxed out for the first time in 2015.\n\nRep. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said her caucus has supported flexibility for schools by suggesting districts such as Davenport be able to tap into their reserves to fund services above what is currently allowed by the state. She said Democrats have also supported addressing inequities in transportation costs between rural and urban districts.\n\n\"So when they talk flexibility, those are two significant items for school districts that have not been addressed yet,\" she said. \"So I would be interested in what they would offer as flexibility that would in any way match the impact of those two things.\"\n\nCollective bargaining\n\nRepublicans also are looking at collective bargaining reform as a way to free up dollars both for schools and the state’s general fund.\n\nRep. Dave Deyoe, R-Nevada and new House Labor Committee chairman, said he anticipates that reforming collective bargaining laws for public sector unions will give school districts more discretion about how they spend the money given to them by the state.\n\nRight now, many lawmakers say, school districts are hamstrung by union contract negotiations requiring teacher pay increases that outpace increases in state aid.\n\n“There’s a strong feeling amongst our caucus that we want to fix some things that are long overdue,” Deyoe said. “But there are lots of opinions within our caucus at this point on how to get there.”\n\nOne bill, passed by the House during the 2015 session, would have given arbitrators more leeway in contract negotiations and would have allowed them to make salary comparisons against similar positions in the private sector. Even though the bill did not have a chance to advance in the Democrat-controlled Senate, House Democrats filibustered the process, dragging out debate for nine hours over two days.\n\nDeyoe called that bill a \"starting point\" for possible legislation in 2017.\n\nDrew Klein, state director for the Iowa chapter of Americans for Prosperity, said his organization will push heavily for broad reforms.\n\n“If we’re going to leave collective bargaining intact, it really should not include anything outside of salary,” he said, noting that his organization believes health care and other benefits should be excluded from union contract negotiations.\n\nGov. Terry Branstad already has made moves to remove health care benefits from collective bargaining negotiations with state and local government workers, arguing that the state could leverage its size to negotiate better terms on behalf of those organizations. Critics contend the move will cut benefits to state workers.\n\nKlein said those changes would save the state money, which is appealing to many Republican legislators in light of reduced revenue estimates and nearly $100 million in looming budget cuts.\n\n“There’s going to be a real need to find some cost savings within state government, and I think this is a natural place to look for that,” he said.\n\nKlein said his organization may also push for “paycheck protection” legislation, which requires consent from workers before unions could use dues for political purposes, as well as requiring annual certification of public unions, granting them the authority to enter into contract negotiations with the state.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Mark Smith, D-Marshalltown, said Democrats will oppose any reduction in collective bargaining benefits to Iowans. He noted that the agreements cover state workers such as prison guards and police officers.\n\n\"These are employees who put their lives in danger all the time,\" he said.\n\nAnd although Democrats will be unable to stop legislation if Republicans are unified, Smith said Democrats plan to use floor debates to \"explain our positions and to inform Iowans of why leaving things the way they are is important.\"\n\nWater quality\n\nThe “No. 1 issue” House Republicans say they want to address this session is water quality, Upmeyer said after meeting with her caucus last week to refine their policy agenda.\n\nShe said the bill the House passed during the 2016 legislative session, which drew revenue from existing water use taxes and infrastructure dollars, is a “good starting point.” The caucus is not inclined to raise the sales tax to fund water quality projects, she said.\n\nMany Democrats favor raising money for water quality by passing a three-eighths cent sales tax, the proceeds of which would go to the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund.\n\nSenate President Whitver said there is a “demand” within the Senate majority to address water quality, though not through a sales tax. He did not speculate what legislation might look like.\n\n“We didn’t see a bill that passed the Senate floor, so we’re maybe a little bit behind where the House and the governor are at this point on the issue,” he said at the Partnership panel. “… It will be at the forefront of our conversations.”\n\nBranstad propelled water quality funding into statewide debate last year when he proposed redirecting some of the future revenue growth from the penny sales tax that funds school infrastructure. That idea failed to gain support. As he heads to China to become U.S. ambassador, Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds will take the helm of state government, directing priorities and goals.\n\nHogg told the Register he’s hopeful Reynolds will take ownership of the water quality issue, noting that she voted in 2009 while in the state Senate to put the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund on the ballot. In 2010, Iowa voters approved establishing the trust, but it's never been funded.\n\n“So she has ownership over that in the way that Gov. Branstad did not,” Hogg said. “… I think if there’s an issue that I’m optimistic that if she wants to she could take ownership of and really make a big difference on, it would be water quality and water management and the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund.”\n\nAbortion restrictions\n\nFor years, Republican lawmakers have tried to pass legislation limiting abortions in Iowa, but were repeatedly blocked by outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, who refused to bring those issues up for debate.\n\nMany Democrats will continue to dig in their heels against restrictions on abortion. But with full control, the debate now is not over whether Republicans will pass anti-abortion legislation, but just how far they’re willing to go on an issue that often is resolved through the courts.\n\n“There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that the caucus I serve in is one of the most pro-life, if not the most pro-life caucuses, I’ve had the opportunity to serve with,” Windschitl said.\n\nHe said many conservatives consider “personhood” legislation, which declares that life begins at conception, the “end all, be all” of the pro-life movement. That declaration effectively would end abortion, supporters say.\n\n“The question inherent within that, though, is even if we pass that bill ... that would end up in court for how long? We don’t know. Would it be upheld? We don’t know,” Windschitl said. “In that time span, how many lives are being lost because you didn’t pass a 20-week abortion ban? Or an abortion ban like Ohio just passed?”\n\nThe Ohio Legislature recently passed a “fetal heartbeat” bill that would ban abortion once a heartbeat is detected — often as early as six weeks into gestation. It was vetoed by Gov. John Kasich who instead signed a 20-week abortion ban into law.\n\nFederal courts have struck down similar laws in other states. But Ohio Republicans said they felt emboldened by President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices who favor restricting abortion.\n\nIowa Republicans in the past also have consistently looked to redirect state dollars that currently go to Planned Parenthood for services such as health care and sex education, even though no state tax dollars are permitted to fund abortions. The House also has discussed further restricting fetal tissue sales and research, passing a scaled-back bill limiting research on fetal tissue obtained from abortions.\n\nWindschitl said he hopes legislators will “look outside the box” and put all options on the table for consideration.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nSen. Rick Bertrand said Iowa gun owners spoke during this election cycle, and “they want big pieces of legislation” expanding their Second Amendment rights.\n\n“I think what you’re going to see is … legislation that is focused completely on strengthening the Second Amendment in Iowa versus nitpicking at the corners,” he said.\n\nPriority No. 1, he said, is “stand your ground” or “castle doctrine” legislation. Those bills generally say individuals do not have a duty to retreat before using deadly force in defending themselves if they believe they face imminent death or injury.\n\nWindschitl, who has ushered numerous pro-gun bills through the Republican-controlled House in recent years only to see their defeat in the Democrat-controlled Senate, said Iowans should expect to see many of those resurrected in some way.\n\nThat includes legislation allowing children younger than 14 to handle firearms under adult supervision as well as moves toward constitutional or permit-less carry, which means Iowans would not need a government permit to carry weapons openly or concealed.\n\n“My intent is to … create a package of Second Amendment issues that we can combine into one piece of legislation and have a thorough and thoughtful discussion about the topics within that legislation,” Windschitl said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/22/shutdown-budget-drama-obamacare/2844981/", "title": "Budget drama unfolds again, with Obamacare center stage", "text": "Susan Davis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRepublicans see pending fiscal deadlines as leverage for a health care fight\n\nA short-term spending bill has to be done by Sept. 30%3B a debt bill by mid-October\n\nDemocrats say they will refuse to negotiate\n\nWASHINGTON — A political drama unfolds in the nation's capital this week as Republicans attempt to dismantle President Obama's health care law, using two budget deadlines that threaten a government shutdown and a national default as their leverage.\n\nCongressional Republicans say the two deadlines provide the best opportunity to extract concessions on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Open enrollment begins Oct. 1 — the same day the federal government would shut down if Congress can't agree to a stopgap spending measure. The second deadline arrives in mid-October when the government hits its borrowing limit.\n\nHouse Republicans are executing a two-pronged attack to gut the health care bill: They approved a spending bill that would defund the law Friday, and they will move forward this week with separate legislation that would delay the implementation of the law for one year in exchange for a one-year extension of the debt limit.\n\nDemocrats say they will not bow to either demand, setting the two parties on a familiar collision course that holds sweeping political and economic consequences ranging from locked doors at museums to a default on billions of dollars of national debt payments.\n\nThe leading actors are well known in this drama, and they are reading from familiar scripts.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, at a GOP rally after Friday's vote: \"Our message to the United States Senate is real simple: The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in a statement Friday: \"So in case there's any shred of doubt in the minds of our House counterparts, I want to be absolutely crystal clear: Any bill that defunds Obamacare is dead, dead.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaking on Fox News Sunday: \"I think Senate Republicans are going to stand side by side with Speaker Boehner and House Republicans, listening to the people and stopping this train wreck that is Obamacare.\"\n\nPresident Obama, speaking to a Congressional Black Caucus event Saturday night: \"Let me say as clearly as I can: It is not going to happen. ... We're not going to allow anyone to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point.\"\n\nWhat is uncertain is how the story ends.\n\nHere is a guide to the coming acts:\n\nBACKSTORY: Another 'fiscal cliff'\n\nThere has been nearly unanimous opposition among Republicans to the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. The GOP-controlled House has voted more than 42 times to repeal the law, but those acts were symbolic acts of defiance against a Democratic Senate and White House.\n\n\"When it comes to the health care law, the debate in the House has been settled. I think our position is very clear: The law is a train wreck, and it's going to raise costs. It's destroying American jobs, and it must go,\" Boehner said last week.\n\nThe impending budget deadlines give the party its latest opportunity to take on the law because the president needs Congress to pass legislation to prevent a fiscal crisis.\n\nThe fiscal year ends Sept. 30, and without a stopgap measure, a shutdown begins the next day.\n\nThe second deadline comes in mid-to-late October, when the nation hits its $16.7 trillion debt limit. A vote of congressional approval is required to raise the limit and allows the U.S. government to meet its financial obligations.\n\nIt's a politically unpopular vote because it can appear to be authorizing new government spending, but in fact, it just covers what Congress has already approved to spend on things such as Social Security benefit checks and interest payments on old debt.\n\nThis fall is the third time Congress has had to approve a debt ceiling increase under Obama. Though the president has vowed not to negotiate over terms to raise the debt ceiling, he has negotiated in the past — fueling GOP confidence he will do so again.\n\nIn 2011, Obama and Congress agreed to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for $2.1 trillion in spending cuts. Previous debt ceiling increases have been tied to spending cuts and budget changes. \"Every major deficit reduction plan over the last 30 years has been tied to the debt limit,\" Boehner said.\n\nFor Republicans, whether the negotiations are a success or a failure hinge on how far they go to rein in Obamacare.\n\n\"I believe that this is our time. This is when it matters. Yes, we voted to repeal Obamacare 30 to 40 times, but this is when it really counts,\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.\n\nACT ONE: Theshutdown threat\n\nOn Friday, House Republicans approved, 230-189, a stopgap measure that would maintain funding levels for federal agencies through Dec. 15. It also includes legislation that would defund the health care law and prioritize debt payments in the event of a default on the debt ceiling.\n\nSenate Democrats intend to respond this week by stripping out the defunding language and default provisions and volleying back to the House a bill that only would extend spending.\n\nIf Senate Republicans such as Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah make good on their threat to use every tactic available to stop Obamacare, the Senate may not vote on a stopgap spending bill until this coming weekend, leaving the House little more than 48 hours to accept or reject it.\n\nDemocrats are betting Republicans won't have the political will to go past the Sept. 30 deadline, because shutdowns are unpopular with the public and the shutdown fights of the 1990s during the Clinton administration left the GOP politically bruised.\n\nBoehner has consistently stated he does not want a shutdown, but there is distinct pressure among his rank-and-file to hold the line.\n\n\"I take (Boehner) at face value that this is a fight that he's going to fight. He believes that by year's end, we will have defunded or postponed Obamacare for a year, and I think he means it,\" said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.\n\nA government shutdown would not be a first. There were 17 full or partial shutdowns from 1977 to 1996, lasting a total of 109 days, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nEvery shutdown is different, and this year's budget battle would come against a different backdrop. Federal budgets have already been reduced by across-the-board cost-cutting imposed in the 2011 compromise, resulting in furloughs at many federal agencies.\n\nSome services would not be affected. Social Security checks would probably still go out, but the federal employees necessary to process new claims could be sent home. Postal delivery would continue. Museums and national parks would close, but government functions necessary for health and safety, including most law enforcement and military operations, would be exempt.\n\nACT TWO: The default threat\n\nHowever the stopgap spending bill is resolved, soon after it lurks a fiscal fight that holds greater consequences to the U.S. and global economies.\n\n\"Shutting down the government is one bad thing, but you shut it down, you open it up again,\" said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \"Not lifting the debt limit is unleashing a torrent, a river of no return. It is beyond cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe nation has never defaulted. Though the exact impacts are unclear, there is broad consensus among economists, financial markets and most lawmakers that it would upend the markets.\n\n\"If you don't raise the debt limit in time, you will be opening an economic Pandora's Box. It will be devastating to the economy,\" Moody's economist Mark Zandi testified before a congressional panel last week.\n\nHe explained the consequences: \"Consumer confidence will sharply decline, investor confidence, business confidence. Businesses will stop hiring, consumers will stop spending, the stock market will fall significantly in value, borrowing costs for businesses and households will rise.\"\n\nHouse Republicans are assembling a debt limit package for a vote as early as this week that would increase the debt limit through 2014 but with conditions: a one-year delay of the implementation of the health care law and a grab bag of GOP-backed economic growth proposals, health care entitlement spending changes, construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and instructions for an overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code.\n\nDemocrats and the White House have not blinked. \"We are going to stand together to protect the president's health care law, and we're going to stand together and not negotiate one iota when it comes to the debt ceiling,\" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nDuring a 2011 impasse over the debt limit, the Treasury Department ruled out many stopgap measures to maintain spending and pay its debts, such as selling off assets. The United States has more than $350 billion in gold reserves on its balance sheet, but Treasury officials said a \"fire sale\" on gold would hurt the dollar and the economy. The Treasury has no practical way of reducing payments by an across-the-board percentage to stay under the debt limit.\n\nCongress has debated several proposals to prioritize payments — by making sure bond holders, Social Security recipients or active-duty military would get paid first, for example. But without direct congressional authority, the Treasury has no way to prioritize who gets paid and who doesn't.\n\n\"At that point, meeting our nation's financial obligations — including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans and contracts with private suppliers — will be put at risk,\" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said last week.\n\nSUBPLOT: GOP divisions\n\nThe legislative assault on the health care law has exposed divides in the GOP, not on the merit — because there is strong support for delaying or dismantling the law — but on the tactics and the political risks they hold.\n\nAt least a dozen Republican senators have publicly split with colleagues on the effort to tie defunding the law on the stopgap spending measure — a clear indication that the defunding effort can't pass Congress.\n\n\"I've said from the beginning that this is a tactic that won't work,\" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \"When you have one-third of government, you don't run the government.\"\n\nThe national campaign led by Cruz, Lee and other fiscal hawks and outside groups has raised unrealistic expectations for what Republicans can achieve controlling just the House, Corker said.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., made the same point on Face the Nation Sunday. \"I agree with them that if we could do this, we should do it. But we can't. And the political reality, you know, tactics and strategies ought to be based on what the real world is. And we do not have the political power to do this.\"\n\nOther Republicans, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., say the party is better served by campaigning against the law and working to pick up the necessary six Senate seats Republicans need to take over the Senate in 2014 and try to win the White House in 2016.\n\nRepublicans see Democratic vulnerabilities in the fight: A number of Senate Democrats are vying for re-election in conservative states.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., called out four Senate Democrats by name Friday, Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, as politically vulnerable because of the law.\n\n\"We have some leverage there,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \"We have a lot of Democrats who don't want to have to vote on this and that frankly might want to work with us in some way to not have to face that choice.\"\n\nCole says he is mindful that a shutdown or a default could be perilous for his party, citing the lessons of the 1990s shutdown. \"I don't need to relive the play, since every survivor just about tells you: 'Don't do it again.'\"\n\nEPILOGUE: Sequels are guaranteed\n\nThe ending will almost certainly be inconclusive.\n\nThree years of a divided Congress in the Obama administration has not produced the kind of long-term budget agreements that both sides claim to seek.

Six Republicans joined every Democrat in voting no.\n\nRepublicans argue the limits on the auditor's office are necessary to protect Iowans' privacy. Democrats and a bipartisan group of state auditors around the country counter that the bill would hamper the auditor's independence and limit the office's ability to oversee more than $12 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, potentially putting some of that at risk.\n\n\"The bill is not intended to go after the ability to perform audits,\" said House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford. \"The bill is intended to protect things like personal health statuses and other things that over the course of the last few years have been a part of what we would consider to just be outside the scope of what an audit should look like.\"\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand is the lone Democrat to hold statewide office in Iowa and has been a frequent target of Republican criticism for investigations his office has conducted into Gov. Kim Reynolds' administration.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn a news conference following the House vote, Sand called the bill \"the greatest pro-corruption bill in state history and the worst perversion of checks and balances in Iowa history.\"\n\n\"It’s not complicated,\" he said. \"If you let a state agency decide what the auditor’s office can look at, how often are they going to find waste, fraud and abuse?\"\n\nThe Senate already passed a different version of the legislation, but since the House changed the bill, the Senate would have to pass it again before it could go to the governor to be signed into law.\n\nSand and Democrats say the bill targets the auditor's office because it's run by a Democrat\n\nDemocrats repeatedly argued during House debate that Republicans were targeting Sand's office because Sand is a Democrat.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, pointed out that Republicans gave newly elected Attorney General Brenna Bird, a Republican, more powers this year through a bill reorganizing state government.\n\n\"We’re giving a lot more power to the attorney general and taking it away from the only statewide Democratic elected official,\" Konfrst said. \"That’s pretty frustrating. It’s not appropriate.\"\n\nGrassley disputed that characterization of the bill.\n\n\"This is not intended to be political,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day this is about an office. And I think that it’s being spun to be about a political battle versus a state office.\"\n\nSand said Republicans are changing the rules for his office because they don't like what he did during his first term, or the fact that he was reelected last fall.\n\n\"Some joker in here wants to convince everybody that this somehow doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that I’m the only elected Democrat in the state of Iowa,\" Sand said. \"I don’t think that a single Iowan doesn’t see through that.\"\n\nWhat information would Auditor Rob Sand be limited from accessing under the Iowa House bill?\n\nThe bill would prohibit the auditor from accessing certain types of personal information, including medical and counselor records, students' educational records, peace officers' reports and attorney work product.\n\nThe bill also prevents the auditor from accessing \"any other information or records that contain personal information that an individual would reasonably expect to be kept private or unnecessary to the objectives and scope of the audit.\"\n\nThe House amended the bill Thursday to provide exceptions allowing the auditor to obtain that information if required to comply with generally accepted government auditing standards, or in cases of alleged or suspected embezzlement or theft.\n\nIf the auditor's office does receive anyone's information, the office would be barred from disclosing it without the person's written consent, or the consent of the audited entity in cases of potential embezzlement, theft or other significant financial irregularities.\n\nThe bill's restrictions also would apply to certified public accountants who are auditing cities, school districts and other public entities.\n\nIowa auditor would be blocked from taking other state government officials or agencies to court\n\nThe bill would also prevent the auditor's office from going to court against another statewide officeholder or executive branch agency, department, board or commission to enforce a subpoena for documents.\n\nInstead, disputes between the state auditor's office and other state entities would have to be decided by a three-person arbitration panel, with one member picked by the auditor's office, the second member picked by the agency being audited and the third member picked by the governor. The board's decision would be final.\n\n\"The auditor of state, a member of the executive branch, should not sue another member of the executive branch,\" said Rep. Michael Bergan, R-Dorchester, the bill's floor manager. \"The cost and time involved in such an endeavor is a poor use of public funds. Iowa taxpayers should not pay for the government to sue itself.\"\n\nDemocrats said the system sets up a panel that is weighted in favor of the agency being audited.\n\n\"They made it so that state agencies can hide documents from the auditor’s office as long as they get the governor to agree — the governor who is responsible for what happens at that state agency,\" Sand said. \"If there’s waste, fraud and abuse there, are they going to choose to let us discover it and show the public or are they going to sweep it under the rug?\"\n\nMore:Bill to limit Iowa auditor could leave $12B in funding unchecked, nonpartisan agency says\n\nRepublicans point to Supreme Court decisions to argue Sand has overreached\n\nLegislative Republicans have pointed to a pair of Iowa Supreme Court decisions to argue Sand has overreached in his authority as auditor.\n\nSand won a high-profile lawsuit in 2021 when the Iowa Supreme Court ruled unanimously that his office had the authority to subpoena the University of Iowa for information about a $1.2 billion deal to lease its utility system to private companies for 50 years.\n\nSome of the questions in the lawsuit revolved around when Sand's audit of the university began. Although the justices ruled unanimously in favor of Sand's subpoena, some took a narrower view of the authority of the auditor's office.\n\nThe bill specifies that an audit begins when the auditor's office first engages with the entity, according to the auditing standards set out by the U.S. Comptroller General and published by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n\"The reason that this bill is before us is in response to the 2021 Supreme Court ruling where the simple fact of when does an audit begin wasn’t defined,\" Bergan said. \"So by incorporating generally accepted governmental accounting standards, those procedures and processes, we get to that point.\"\n\nSand said the court ruling is two years old, and no legislators contacted his office with concerns until the Senate unveiled the bill the day they voted on it last month.\n\n\"Nobody in two years called us, emailed us, tweeted at us, Facebooked us, slid into our DMs. Nothing,\" he said. \"That claim, everyone will understand if they hear that, has no validity.\"\n\nMore:State auditor Rob Sand not entitled to records of insurance pool junkets, Iowa Supreme Court rules\n\nIn another Supreme Court decision earlier this month, the court ruled unanimously that Sand doesn't have the authority to subpoena the Iowa Communities Assurance Pool, a group that provides property and casualty coverage for nearly 800 Iowa municipalities and other public entities and took expensive junkets to posh resorts on Lake Michigan and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRepublicans have argued that case shows Sand has overreached his authority. Sand said his only interest is accountability for the spending of tax dollars.\n\nWhat do other groups say about the bill?\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency has said that if the Senate bill were enacted without changes it could limit the auditor's ability to oversee more than $12 billion in state and federal funds. That could potentially put some of that funding at risk if the state could not prove it has adequate oversight over the programs.\n\nRep. Elizabeth Wilson, D-Marion, asked Bergan whether he disagrees with the agency's analysis that funds would be put at risk by the bill.\n\n\"I think that the Senate file that came over here was at risk,\" Bergan said. \"I believe the amendment that has been adopted solves those issues. That was the purpose of amending the bill, to avoid those issues raised by the initial legislation.\"\n\n\"There’s a lot on the line,\" Wilson said. \"I hope you’re right, but I respectfully disagree and I urge you to vote no.\"\n\nA number of state and national groups have either registered to oppose the bill or written letters urging lawmakers not to pass the measure. Groups in opposition include the Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants, the Institute of Internal Auditors, and a former U.S. Comptroller General.\n\nThe only organization registered in favor of the bill is Informed Choice Iowa, a group that opposes vaccine mandates.\n\nThe president of the National State Auditors Association, Connecticut State Auditor John Geragosian, wrote on April 7 that the House amendment to the bill, particularly the three-member arbitration panel, would allow state agencies to refuse to share information with the auditor's office.\n\n\"This board presents a clear threat to the state auditor's independence,\" he wrote.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/10/05/conflict-resolution-in-dc-thats-non-essential/2918891/", "title": "Conflict resolution?

News releases, most blaming the other side, continued to flow out of the taxpayer-funded offices.\n\nBut there were plenty of areas of government impacted by the shutdown. And some were quite telling. For instance, John Krauss, director of the Indiana University Public Policy Institute, is among the federal government’s roster of approved mediators. Such services were deemed “non-essential.”\n\n“Due to a lapse in appropriations and the shutdown of the federal government, nearly all of the employees of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution have been furloughed,” a letter sent to Krauss and other mediators said.\n\n“There is some irony in the fact that the federal government has deemed conflict resolution non-essential,” Krauss said.\n\nHe’s right. Given the brutal fights that have come to define Washington, D.C., perhaps that is one area of government that should be expanded.\n\nBudget showdown brews in Indy\n\nNot much love is lost these days between Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard and City-County Council leaders.\n\nDespite vows by both sides this year to work together to avoid the trainwreck that ended last year’s budget season, the city’s Democrats and Republicans appear headed for another showdown.\n\nRecriminations have built on each side. Council Democrats, who have a 15-14 majority, have called out the mayor for proposing moves that would increase tax bills. The Republican mayor and his staffers have called the Democrats’ competing plan irresponsible and unsustainable because it would tap more heavily into reserves.\n\nTheir disagreements center on how to close a $9 million police funding gap and how to stem dwindling officer ranks in the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nUnlike in Washington, D.C., where budget squabbles played a part in last week’s shutdown, city leaders must adopt the 2014 city-county budget by the end of October. They can’t put off hard choices.\n\nThe council is set to take a final vote on its version of the $1 billion budget Oct. 14. Last week, President Maggie Lewis and fellow Democrat Angela Mansfield, who chairs the Administration and Finance Committee, said that committee won’t consider big changes they’ve outlined until Oct. 14, just hours before the full council meets.\n\nThe upside: That delay could give council leaders more time to negotiate with Ballard and his chief of staff, Ryan Vaughn. Both sides planned to meet again last week to discuss Democrats’ plans to dip into parking meter, information technology and, potentially, roadwork funds.\n\nThe downside: The final version of the budget won’t be clear until the last minute.\n\nThen the ball returns to Ballard’s court. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the budget, veto it fully or veto individual items. But that latter power allows Ballard only to reject items, not to rewrite or adjust them.\n\nIU center explains when government has worked\n\nOn the first day the federal government partially shut down because lawmakers couldn’t agree on a funding resolution, the Indiana University Center on Congress tried to remind people that Congress can sometimes accomplish things.\n\nThe center on Tuesday launched a “congressional moments” app for iPad tablets to make the case that people’s lives are profoundly shaped by Congress’ actions. It offers an interactive tour of such major accomplishments as child labor laws, civil rights legislation, women’s suffrage, and creation of the National Park Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n“We aim to help teachers, students and citizens use the latest technology to make civics learning interesting and relevant,” said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, the center’s director.\n\nOr, another way students could learn the relevancy of civics is to try to visit a closed national park.\n\nContributors: Jon Murray, Matthew Tully, Maureen Groppe", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/05"}]}

The shadow chancellor is a former Bank of England economist and it “is ultimately Reeves’ CV, the subtext of which is Starmerism distilled, that has foisted the shadow chancellor over [Angela] Rayner into Labour’s de facto number two spot”, said Politics.co.uk.\n\nWho is Rachel Reeves?\n\n“Labour runs through her blood,” wrote The Mirror. Reeves joined the party aged just 16, while her sister, Ellie Reeves, and her brother-in-law, John Cryer, are also Labour MPs.\n\nReeves joined the party shortly before Labour’s landslide victory in 1997, and was inspired by the “Blair’s babes” generation of women in the party, she told The New Statesman. “That was the first time there were women MPs we could relate to,” she told the magazine. “They were dressed normally, they were young, they looked like modern women who were about ten years older than me and I thought ‘this is something I could do’.”\n\nBrought up in Lewisham, southeast London, Reeves attended her local state school and her parents, Sally and Graham, were both teachers. As a child she was a highly competitive chess player, winning her first match at seven and becoming a national champion aged 14.\n\nReeves went on to read philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then took a master’s in economics at LSE. Before becoming an MP, Reeves worked as an economist at the Bank of England, as well as at the British embassy in Washington, and at Halifax Bank of Scotland.\n\nReeves was “earmarked as a ‘rising star’ in the Labour Party from the moment she was elected in 2010”, said Alibhe Rea, also in The New Statesman. Under Ed Miliband, she was appointed the shadow pensions minister just six months after becoming the MP for Leeds West. But she would spend years in the political wilderness during the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn – with whom she had significant ideological differences – and resigned to the backbenches after a period of maternity leave.\n\nUnder Starmer, she served as the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 2020 and 2021, before being appointed shadow chancellor in May 2021.\n\nStarmer’s de facto deputy\n\nReeves was once described as “boring snoring” by a disgruntled television executive after a wooden Newsnight performance, but many believe she is now well on her way to becoming the UK’s first female chancellor if the Labour Party maintains its lead in the polls.\n\nShe has seemingly become indispensable to Starmer of late, noted Politics.co.uk. “When Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer touched down in snowy Davos this January, ready to schmooze business leaders in the Swiss Alps, he did not disembark alone,” but was “flanked by his shadow chancellor and trusty treasury sidekick, Rachel Reeves”.\n\nThe “Davos double-act” was a further signal of the pair’s “political affinity”, said the news site, adding: “the nearer British politics edges to an election expected in late 2024, the more inseparable Reeves and Starmer appear”.\n\nAnd the fallout from Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget in September gave Reeves her “most significant boost” to date. Starmer knows that his shadow chancellor’s “stolidity in the face of the Conservative government’s frequent fiscal do-overs presents Labour with the perfect optics” and hopes her “continued presence” opposite four Conservative chancellors has created “a sense of elusive political continuity and policy dependability”.\n\nTax review plans\n\nFollowing reports that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will refuse to bow to backbench demands to row back on plans to increase corporation tax in next week’s Spring Budget, Labour has said it will support the hike.\n\nBut Reeves used her speech on Thursday to promise a comprehensive review of the UK’s tax regime “as the party tries to shore up its economic credentials ahead of the next election”, said Politico.\n\nAccording to Reeves, the review will look at “a roadmap for tax which lasts over a parliament”, and weigh up whether the UK’s “current system of capital allowances is fit for purpose in its design and operation, including for small businesses who are crucial for growth”.\n\nCriticising the plans, Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands said: “We don’t need Labour to do a tax review to know that they’d put taxes up on business. Corporation tax remains lower than it was at any point of the last Labour government.”", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Richard Windsor", "Theara Coleman", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/09"}]}

Polls have shown many consumers are not sold on making the switch, with concerns about range and the upfront cost of electric vehicles much more than many gasoline-powered models.\n\nBut Biden administration officials said if automakers embrace electric vehicles as the key way toward the future — and many already have, with General Motors, for example, aspiring to be \"all-electric\" by 2035 — they project that under the newly proposed standards those cars and trucks could account for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales in model year 2032.\n\nThat change, they said, is also being driven by states, led by California, looking for all new vehicles to emit zero greenhouse gases by 2035; worldwide efforts to battle climate change; and Biden's own initiatives, including those to encourage consumers to buy electric vehicles and spur domestic battery production and the installation of hundreds of thousands of charging stations.\n\n\"It’s not simple, it’s not easy,\" Margo Oge, former head of EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, said of the potential for electric vehicles sales to top 60% of the market by the 2030s. \"But is it doable? Yes it is.\"\n\nMore:Fewer electric vehicles to qualify for full $7,500 tax credit under new rules\n\nMore:So you think you know how much power your electrified vehicle has? Think again.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced the new standards, which would take effect in 2027, saying the federal government isn't requiring automakers to adopt electric vehicles but indicating that is one preferred path. With large investments and additional incentives in place, Regan said of the historically tough standards, \"I believe we can (achieve that level of electric vehicles sales) and I believe that because we’re following the market trends.\"\n\n\"This is the future,\" he said.\n\nDetroit automakers were generally noncommittal but said they would review the proposals and work with the administration. Matt Ybarra, General Motors' senior manager of public policy communications, said while GM moves toward achieving an \"all-electric future,\" more investment in manufacturing and charging stations is needed. Ford, meanwhile, said it would \"continue to work with the EPA and other stakeholders to set standards that are good for our customers and communities, the auto industry and the environment.\"\n\nEric Mayne, a spokesman for Stellantis, owner of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat, said the company, while committed to reducing vehicle emissions, was \"surprised that none of the alternatives align with the president’s previously announced target of 50% EVs by 2030.” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares in the past has urged governments to adopt a more flexible approach than mandating electric vehicles, noting the upfront cost of those vehicles.\n\nJohn Bozzella, head of the Alliance for Auto Innovation, which includes most major vehicle makers, said even with the investments the companies have made, the proposed plan \"is aggressive by any measure.\"\n\nLess than two years ago, Biden himself set a target of 50% of all new vehicle sales in the nation being zero-emission. But the new proposal suggests the changeover could come even more quickly, while recognizing that \"tens of millions\" of gasoline-powered vehicles will remain in use well into the 2030s.\n\nIn a call with reporters Tuesday, Regan and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi revealed the broad outlines of the proposal, which looks to continue cutting greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources substantially.\n\nFor instance, the adjusted fleetwide target for light-duty cars and trucks in model year 2026 of 186 grams of carbon dioxide emitted per mile would be reduced by more than half, to 82 grams per mile fleetwide, by 2032, a reduction of 56%. New standards proposed for medium-duty vehicles like school buses and box trucks would see a 44% reduction compared with model year 2026 standards. The rules also look to cut emissions from heavy-duty trucks as well.\n\nIf reductions at the same level continued through 2055, the administration said, it would result in keeping 7.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide from entering the air, \"equivalent to eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions from the entire U.S. transportation sector for four years.\"\n\n\"These ambitious standards are readily achievable,\" Regan said, touting the benefits to public health and in battling climate change by reducing pollution and arguing that by reducing fuel and maintenance costs, the average consumer could save $12,000 over the lifespan of a light-duty vehicle not subject to the proposed standards.\n\nAlbert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade coalition advocating for policies to promote electric vehicle sales, called the standards and the goal of higher EV sales \"eminently achievable\" and ones that could \"create millions of advanced manufacturing jobs across the country.\"\n\nFred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund, said with the introduction of the proposal on Wednesday, \"America accelerated toward a clean transportation future and more jobs.\"\n\nThey will still cause controversy: Oil companies are vehemently opposed to such a program and Republicans in Congress have complained in the past that Biden and the environmental community are trying to force the public to embrace more expensive electric vehicles against their will.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing oil and natural gas producers, issued a statement saying, \"This deeply flawed proposal is a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on. As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains.”\n\n\"The Biden administration's new rules will all but force Americans to buy electric cars,\" said U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Caledonia. \"This is wrong. We need competition and policies that let Americans choose the vehicles that best meet their needs.\"\n\nNot all environmentalists were pleased either. Dan Becker, an advocate for more environmentally friendly cars and director of the Washington-based Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said the proposal doesn't go nearly far enough, falling \"well short of the 75% pollution cut necessary to protect our planet.\" According to a chart in the EPA documents, the proposed standards would cut carbon dioxide emissions overall by about 8% compared to taking no action by 2032, though it would go up to 47% if continued through 2055.\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, who has been an instrumental conduit between automakers, the UAW and the Biden administration, didn't offer unequivocal support either, saying any transition to EVs needs to take into account that they generally take fewer workers to assemble. \"We know that to meet our climate goals we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. \"But in doing so, we must not leave behind the working men and women who have built their lives and careers in the auto industry.\"\n\nThe UAW responded to the proposal saying the EV industry should be \"entirely unionized.\"\n\n\"People who build cars for a living don't do it because we're passionate about combustion engines or electric vehicles,\" the statement said. \"We do it because we're passionate about our families and our communities.\" Biden has also said that union workers need to be heavily involved in the making of electric cars and trucks.\n\nWhile automakers have clearly moved toward investing heavily in electric vehicles, they have also indicated that achieving sales like those projected by the EPA require massive changes in terms of production, supplies of crucial minerals for batteries and available charging stations for consumers. Last week, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, issued a memo ahead of Wednesday's announcement saying that while EV sales continue to increase this year, \"This requires a massive, 100-year change to the U.S. industrial base and the way Americans drive.\"\n\nGenevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a group that includes automakers and utilities and promotes electrification of the automobile industry, said it's going to take \"the entire portfolio of policy tools, such as consumer incentives, regulatory frameworks and manufacturing programs\" to achieve the goal.\n\n\"We are with the administration in terms of moving aggressively toward electrification. This is certainly aggressive,\" she said.\n\nUltimately, both the final rule adopted by EPA, which is likely to come next year, and that proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will determine fuel standards. But those are not the only agencies involved: The Energy Department this week announced it was altering the way in which it calculates a \"petroleum-equivalent\" factor for EVs compared with gasoline-powered vehicles, saying under the long-standing current program EVs are rated more efficient than they really are. That allows manufacturers to count that inflated mileage against their less-efficient vehicles when determining whether they meet fleetwide emissions and fuel economy standards.\n\nEPA officials argue that, ultimately, a vast change in the number of EVs sold is entirely possible, saying enough investment is flooding into battery production to make enough to produce 13 million EVs by 2030, which would be more than half the new vehicles sold.\n\nUnlike in past proposals, the EPA didn't provide an estimate of what the targeted reductions would translate to in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline consumed fleetwide. But with the current model year 2026 target set at 49 mpg for light-duty cars and trucks, it would have to translate into a sizable increase. The proposal says that by 2032, it would likely cost manufacturers more than $1,000 per vehicle across the light-duty fleet to produce vehicles that could hit the target.\n\nEPA officials said reduced fuel costs, repair costs and maintenance would more than offset that.\n\nThe proposal, which provides two months for the EPA to receive comments on its plan, also includes alternatives for consideration, including one that is more stringent and a second that is less so. A third would also cut emissions by 56% in 2032 compared with 2026 but would do so with less stringent reductions in the first years and more stringent ones beyond that.\n\nAs in past emission standards proposals, the proposed rule didn't dictate what technology automakers use to hit the targets, but they predicted, given the state of the industry, they would result in wider use of filters and other means to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-powered engines and likely \"accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.\"\n\nZaidi said changes already adopted by automakers, with dozens of new electric models set to come on the market, and huge investments in domestic battery production, like that announced by Ford in Marshall, as well as government programs to provide up to $7,500 in incentives to buyers of some vehicles and spur the creation of vehicle charging stations nationwide, makes the changeover to electric vehicles possible.\n\nFor instance, Walmart this week announced plans to install charging stations at thousands of its locations nationwide.\n\n\"If you think about where we were just a little over two years ago,\" he said, \"the number of (electric) models has doubled, the number of charging stations has doubled and the number of EVs (electric vehicles) deployed on our roads has tripled. ... Over $120 billion in private capital (is) coming off the sidelines and into our capacity to create American-made electric vehicle and battery supply chains here in the United States.\"\n\nFree Press staff writers Jamie LaReau, Phoebe Wall Howard and Eric Lawrence contributed to this report.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

The standards mandate regular monitoring for methane leaks at well cites and compressor stations. Regulations also require a reduction in emissions from high-emitting equipment like controllers, pumps, and storage tanks.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan announced the rule in Dubai at the United Nations' climate summit, COP28, which Vice President Kamala Harris is attending on behalf of President Joe Biden.\n\n“On day one, President Biden restored America’s critical role as the global leader in confronting climate change, and today we’ve backed up that commitment with strong action, significantly slashing methane emissions and other air pollutants that endanger communities,\" Regan said in a statement.\n\nMethane, a compound that forms the base of natural gas, is considered many times more potent than carbon dioxide. The White House projects the new regulations will prevent 1.5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2038 that would have otherwise been emitted.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe final rules also includes a \"super emitter program\" that will rely on remote sensing from third parties to detect large methane releases or leaks by oil and gas companies.\n\nThe final EPA rules for methane emissions follow a two-year public comments period and builds off proposals the Biden administration put forward in November 2021 and December 2022.\n\nThe EPA projects a minimal impact on the price of a oil as result of the standards. An EPA analysis estimated a 25-cent increase in per-barrel costs, or about .03%. The health and climate benefits of the methane emissions standards will total $98 billion by 2038, according to the EPA.\n\nBiden proposed the methane rules at the COP26 in Scotland in 2021, calling it crucial to achieve a goal of limiting rising global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century.\n\nIn related efforts targeting methane pollution, the Biden administration has put $660 million in federal funds toward the capping of dormant oil wells as part of the infrastructure law that Congress approved in 2021.\n\nThe new methane emissions rules come as temperatures are rising at an alarming pace. Kicking off COP28 on Thursday, the World Meteorological Organization announced that 2023 is “virtually certain” to be warmest year ever recorded.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly known as Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/15/oil-gas-air-pollution-controls-new-mexico-officials-permian-basin-fossil-fuel-environment-department/7294863001/", "title": "Oil and gas air pollution controls approved by New Mexico officials", "text": "A cancer-causing pollutant in New Mexico's air could be curbed as the State adopted regulations targeting dangerous emissions from the oil and gas industry.\n\nNew Mexico environmental regulators concluded three straight days of debate Wednesday and voted to approve new standards for oil and gas operators targeting gas released during fossil fuel production that could form toxic, ground-level ozone.\n\nThe proposed new rules were devised by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) for deliberation and enactment by the Environmental Improvement Board, and were expected to take effect this summer.\n\nThis week’s deliberations finalized the language of the regulations, developed over the past two years of collaboration between NMED, the oil and gas industry, environmentalists and other stakeholders.\n\nSign up for our newsletter, the Daily Briefing, to get stories like this one delivered straight to your inbox every morning.\n\nOzone is a gas formed when volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as those emitted by oil and gas operations, interact with sunlight.\n\nIt occurs in the atmosphere and at the ground-level.\n\nOn the ground, ozone is a cancer-causing air pollutant.\n\nMore:Oil and gas flowing from Permian Basin on heels of COVID-19, Russia-Ukraine conflict\n\nThat’s why the NMED worked to devise new regulations targeting reductions in the emission of ozone precursors from the oil and gas sector, chemicals that could lead to the gas’ formation.\n\nThe agency estimated the new rules would reduce VOCs and other air pollutants in New Mexico by about 260 million pounds a year, and reduce methane emissions by about 851 million pounds annually.\n\nThe NMED rules were intended to work in conjunction with the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department’s (EMRD) recently-enacted regulations imposing a requirement that operators capture 98 percent of produced gas by 2026.\n\nEMRND last year also outlawed spills, meaning any release would immediately incur fines ahead of mitigation efforts and banned routine venting and flaring.\n\nMore:Fluctuating oil prices do not hamper February oil and gas tax collections for Eddy County\n\nNMED’s rules would increase monitoring and reporting requirements for emission events at oil and gas facilities in counties where ozone levels exceed federal standards – mostly areas also known for heavy fossil fuel production in the southeast Permian Basin and northwest San Juan Basin.\n\nThe rules will apply to Eddy, Lea, Chaves, Dona Ana, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, San Juan and Valencia counties.\n\nIt would also call for facilities to be retrofitted with new, low-emission valves and other technologies intended to lower the amount of gas released.\n\nThe ozone rules were developed over the last two years since Gov.

of debate in March and resumed on Monday for the following three days – its final discussion ahead of a vote to place the rules into law.\n\nDebate centered around requirements on “low-bleed” pneumatic valve requirements, the importance of notifying landowners if venting or flaring was needed during an emergency and the State’s ability to impose environmental rules stricter than the federal government.\n\nBoard members considered multiple changes to NMED’s proposed rules from oil and gas industry organizations, environmental groups and other stakeholders, crafting what would

federal standards so far failed to prevent areas of New Mexico from violating such standards, moving those regions toward being declared in “non-attainment” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which could lead to strict federal restrictions on land use in the state.\n\n“To the extent that a party is proposing something more stringent or above a federal standard, if we’re inching to non-attainment, shouldn’t we be adopting something more stringent that the federal standards?” she said during Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“The federal standard is not keeping us in

National Park Service, it was reported that air at the Carlsbad Caverns exceeded federal ozone limits 15 times in 2021, nine times in 2020, six times in 2019 and 10 times in 2018 – years known for

volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 9.7 million tons.\n\nOil and gas is the nation’s largest source of methane pollution, according to the EPA, and is a greenhouse gas that traps about 80 time as much heat as carbon dioxide in the first 20 years of its release, contributing to global warming.\n\nMore:Canadian oil and gas company targets Permian Basin fossil fuels as energy transition

most vulnerable communities and to put us on a path to achieve President Biden’s ambitious climate goals,” he said in a statement.\n\nBut oil and gas industry leaders were critical of the federal efforts, worrying tighter regulations could mean higher costs for domestic energy producers, thus increasing the U.S.’ reliance on imports from countries with laxer existing requirements.\n\nFrank Macchiarola, senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute (API) said fossil fuel companies were already taking steps on their own to reduce emissions without added government rules.\n\n“API’s member companies are continuously advancing and deploying new technology to improve methane detection and reduction, and we support a final rule that promotes this continued innovation,” he said.\n\n“Federal regulation of methane crafted to build on industry’s progress can help accelerate emissions reductions while developing reliable American energy.”\n\nAdrian Hedden

More broadly, methane emissions from the oil and natural-gas industry decreased by 12 percent during the same period.\n\nFracking refers to the process of fracturing rock inside wells using pressurized liquid, often water with sand in it. Oil and natural gas then flow through the cracks in the deep rock.\n\nFracking production has increased in recent years. Information from the Energy Information Administration within the U.S. Department of Energy shows production of natural gas from shale formations has risen from 5 percent of U.S. dry gas production in 2004 to 56 percent in 2015. Oil acquired as a result of fracking also rose from about 10 percent of U.S. oil production in 2004 to 48 percent in 2015.\n\nTotal U.S. dry gas and oil production has also risen since 2004.\n\nGosar's spokesman, Steven Smith, said in a phone interview that Gosar believes emissions from both fracking and the entire industry will continue to decrease because of self-regulation on the part of the energy industry coupled with effective state laws.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Gosar's statement that methane emissions from fracking have significantly decreased despite increases in production is true. The EPA's proposal would regulate the entire oil and natural-gas industry, which extends beyond fracking, but the industry has seen a drop in methane emissions overall as well.\n\nTHE FINDING: Four stars: True\n\nSources: Rep.

pumps, disincentivize flaring – the burning of excess gas – and processes to identify “super emitters” of air pollutants.\n\nIf enacted, the EPA estimated its proposal would reduce methane emissions

released into the air and adjacent communities.\n\nNew Mexico ranks second in the nation in crude oil production, and frequently in the top 10 states for natural gas, and methane emissions were

environmental agencies tasked with keeping our air clean are truly doing their job to minimize pollution as much as possible.”\n\nAlthough New Mexico took steps to curb emissions, Antoinette Reyes with the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club said Texas’ actions were insufficient and federal rules were needed to protect New Mexico from Permian Basin pollution spewing from the east.\n\n“Air pollution knows no boundary, these rules will meaningfully improve life for New Mexico communities bordering states lacking meaningful protections, like Texas,” she said. “It is vital that the EPA

the drive to turbocharge a car revolution | The Week", "text": "It’s not often a regulatory body sets out to remake an entire industry, said the Los Angeles Times, but that’s just what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to do with the automakers. A good thing too. Last week it proposed new emission rules that require manufacturers to electrify two-thirds of their passenger vehicles by 2032, “about half of new buses, garbage trucks and delivery vans” and up to 25% of new trucks. All the above will have to be zero­-emission by then.\n\nThe EPA reckons scrapping that many comb­ustion engines would reduce carbon emissions pumped into the atmosphere by nearly ten billion tons. Yes, there are questions to answer about supply-chain readiness, charging stations, and consumer attitudes toward electric vehicles (EVs), which last year accounted for less than 6% of vehicle sales. But the EPA shouldn’t have to wait for all problems to be solved before pressing ahead. “Regulations drive results, and the planet needs results quickly.”\n\nWhat we see here, said The Wall Street Journal, is the Biden administration “remaking a major industry in a way unprecedented in a free-market economy”. Only last month, the Energy Information Administration forecast that by 2030, EVs will constitute a mere 15% of sales. To try to force an additional 50%, as the EPA is doing, is “Chinese-style central planning”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But the up to $7,500 tax credit for buyers of EVs introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) won’t help much with that, since the IRA’s aim is to revive US manufacturing, so the subsidy only applies for EVs made in America using components made or mined in America. And right now the components that go into Teslas, and other US electric vehicles, are mostly made or mined in China. The hefty cost of rewiring and “reshoring” the supply chain is going to make those EVs very much less affordable.\n\n(Image credit: Onur Dongel/Getty Images)\n\nMaybe so, said Nitish Pahwa on Slate, but the EPA’s aggressive targets can still be achieved. EV sales are already soaring: last year saw a 65% leap, even though supply-chain short­ages pushed up prices. The fact that “cities are rapidly installing chargers on streets and buildings”, and that the improving efficiency of batteries enables motorists to travel further without charging, has done much to allay concerns about range. It’s not as if the automakers have been caught off-guard, said Stephen Wilmot in The Wall Street Journal. Knowing that they are “losing business to Tesla”, and that the EU and the UK are moving decisively towards outright bans on new petrol vehicles in the next decade, they’ve already been investing billions in electric manufacturing.\n\nThe truth is, consumers are on the fence about battery-powered cars, said Josh Kraushaar on Axios. A Gallup poll earlier this month found “just 12% of Americans are seriously considering buying” one; 41% “said they’d never buy one”. What the EPA is essentially doing is compelling consumers “to buy vehicles that currently are more expensive and have less driving range” than cars they’re used to.

The process would also include a 60-day public comment period. After the comment period, the agency would do a review and then issue a final rule, which would be in effect beginning with the 2027 model year.\n\nThe Transportation Department, in its announcement, touted potential savings to consumers and benefits to the environment from the rule if implemented as proposed — more than $50 billion in fuel over the vehicles’ lifetimes, a reduction of more than 88 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050 and keeping the equivalent of 233 million vehicles off the road through 2050 because of emissions reductions.\n\n“Better vehicle fuel efficiency means more money in Americans’ pockets and stronger energy security for the entire nation,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a news release.\n\nIn a likely nod to concerns from some that increasingly stringent rules make vehicles more expensive, officials said the combined benefits would exceed the costs by more than $18 billion. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, while acknowledging the importance of addressing climate change, has raised repeated concerns that the regulatory push toward electrification may price out middle class consumers, and Ford, for instance, is losing money on its EV bet while it and Tesla have pushed a price-cutting strategy to boost sales.\n\nNHTSA officials insisted, however, that this proposal doesn’t mandate electrification, noting that “manufacturers may use all available technologies — including advanced internal combustion engines, hybrid technologies and electric vehicles — for compliance.” Many automakers have announced ambitious EV strategies even as they continue to book big profits from gas- and diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nThe preferred alternative in NHTSA’s proposal “includes a 2% per year improvement in fuel efficiency for passenger cars, and a 4% per year improvement for light trucks, beginning in model year 2027 and ramping up through model year 2032, potentially reaching an average fleet fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon by 2032. It also includes a 10% improvement per year for commercial pickup trucks and work vans,” according to the release.\n\nNHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson noted that light trucks start from a lower fuel economy so they have more room for improvement and that heavy trucks and vans would see a big change if the proposal is finalized as envisioned, cutting fuel consumption almost in half for heavy duty pickups and work vans.\n\nThe proposal is the latest move by the Biden administration to shift the U.S. vehicle fleet in coming years.\n\nIn April, the EPA, under authority given it by the Clean Air Act, proposed historically tougher greenhouse gas emission standards for cars and trucks that it said could lead to electric vehicles accounting for more than two-thirds of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. by 2032 — a remarkable transition to EVs if it were to come to pass. Those standards — which are still being finalized and aren’t expected to be finished until sometime next year — don’t mandate a transition to EVs but so greatly reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions for the new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. beginning in model year 2027 that it’s hard to see how automakers would meet them otherwise.\n\nFor instance, under EPA’s proposed rule., the adjusted fleetwide target for light-duty cars and trucks in model year 2026 of 186 grams of carbon dioxide emitted per mile would be reduced by more than half, to 82 grams per mile fleetwide, by 2032, a reduction of 56%. And standards proposed for medium-duty vehicles like school buses and box trucks would see a 44% reduction compared with model year 2026 standards. The rule would cut emissions from heavy-duty trucks as well.\n\nUnlike in some past administrations, however, the Biden administration has allowed both EPA and NHTSA to issue separate rule-making as is related to fuel emission standards. As a consequence, EPA’s rule announced in April didn’t include mile-per-gallon targets unlike its past emission mandates. Instead, it stuck to allowable amounts of greenhouse gases emitted fleetwide. NHTSA’s new rule, on the other hand, includes mpg standards considered largely in line with EPA’s greenhouse gas targets and the agencies consulted with each other before issuing their rules.\n\nEPA’s rule, meanwhile, has faced some strong pushback. The Alliance for Auto Innovation, a trade group representing most major automakers, has told the agency that while it fully supports the move to electrification, the supply chain and infrastructure hurdles make the prospect of having EVs top 60% of all new car and truck sales in less than a decade a huge challenge. The Alliance’s senior director of energy and environment, Mike Hartrick, said in May it also represented “a significant movement of the country’s electrification goal posts” from Biden’s earlier goal of having EVs make up 50% of sales by the end of the decade. “To be clear, the administration’s 50% target was always a stretch goal,” he said.\n\nReuters reported this week that the Biden administration has also rejected a warning by GM that its proposed emission standards could cost the auto industry hundreds of billions in fines by 2032. Meanwhile, Republicans, especially in the U.S. House, have been working both to block the new emissions standards from going into place and prohibiting states led by California from moving toward prohibiting the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines, though those measures have little chance of passing in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate.\n\nContact Eric D.

She said nearly 76 million voters cast their ballots for Putin, his highest vote tally ever.\n\nPutin hailed the results as a clear indication of Russia's \"trust\" and \"hope\" in him. But his many critics saw them as another illustration of the preordained nature of the election. Criticism of Putin or his war in Ukraine has been criminalized. Independent media outlets have been closed down. Putin's fiercest political foe, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic prison last month. Other Putin opponents are either in jail or in exile.\n\nRussia's election:Putin hails big win as a sign of 'trust' in him\n\nGermany called the vote a \"pseudo-election,\" and Washington described it \"neither free nor fair.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin was \"sick with power and is doing everything in his power to rule forever.\" British Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote on X: \"This is not what free and fair elections look like.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"The elections took place in an ever-shrinking political space, which has resulted in an alarming increase of violations of civil and political rights, and precluded many candidates from running, including all those opposed to Russia’s illegal war of aggression, deprived Russian voters of a real choice and heavily limited their access to accurate information,\" said Josep Borrell, the European Union's top foreign policy official.\n\nRussian presidential election:Vladimir Putin cements longest reign since Stalin\n\nThere were also congratulations sent from some of Russia's allies, including Cuba, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as the leaders of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nIn a news conference Sunday, Putin said he would press on with his invasion of Ukraine.

It won 53% of the vote with almost all ballots counted, enough for a commanding lead over a united coalition of opposition parties.\n\nThe election campaign was dominated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which put Orban’s lengthy association with Russian President Vladimir Putin under scrutiny. In his victory speech, Orban called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky one of the “opponents” he had to overcome during the campaign.\n\nHungary is heavily reliant on Russian energy and Orban has dodged opportunities to condemn Putin’s assault on its neighboring state, complicating the EU’s efforts to present a united front against him. Putin congratulated Orban on his victory, a Kremlin spokesperson said Monday, adding: “Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of bilateral partnership fully meets the interests of Russia and Hungary.”\n\nOrban faced a more organized opposition campaign than in previous polls, but his Fidesz party nonetheless won comfortably across much of the country. Opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay even failed to win in his own district, where he had served as mayor.\n\n“We have such a victory it can be seen from the moon, but it’s sure that it can be seen from Brussels,” Orban said in his speech on Sunday night, making light of his government’s long-running tensions with EU leaders.\n\n“We will remember this victory until the end of our lives because we had to fight against a huge amount of opponents,” Orban said, citing a number of his political enemies including the Hungarian left, “bureaucrats” in Brussels, the international media, “and the Ukrainian president too – we never had so many opponents at the same time.”\n\nThe results indicate that Fidesz will hold 135 seats in Hungary’s 199-seat parliament, meaning Orban would retain a two-thirds majority that will allow him to enact further changes to Hungary’s constitution.\n\nThe far-right, anti-vaccine party Our Homeland also made it to Parliament, winning seven seats in a strong showing.\n\nBut Orban did not have a perfect night; a controversial referendum on banning educational materials and programs for children that are considered to promote homosexuality and gender reassignment – seen by critics as an attempt to demonize Hungary’s LGBTQ community – failed to attract enough votes to be considered valid.\n\nA thorny relationship with the EU\n\nOrban has gained close control of Hungary’s judiciary, media and education institutions during his 12-year stint in power, which is now set to be extended until 2026. He has pushed legislation targeting migrants and the LGBTQ+ community, and has spoken of his intention to build an “illiberal” state within the EU.\n\nCritics have long complained that he has tilted the political playing field against his opponents. Last month, Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE), recommended a full-scale international monitoring operation of the April 3 poll – a rare move for an EU state – after assessing claims of “a general deterioration of the conditions for democratic elections.”\n\nBut after a crushing victory on Sunday, Hungary is unlikely to revert from its collision course with Brussels leadership.\n\n“The whole world could see this evening in Budapest that the Christian Democrat politics, the conservative politics and the nationalistic politics won,” Orban said on Sunday night. “Our message to Europe is that it’s not the past but the future. This will be our common European future.”\n\nOrban visited his ally Putin weeks before Moscow invaded Ukraine. Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Sputnik/Getty Images\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Orban campaigned primarily on a platform of keeping Hungary’s troops and weapons out of the conflict. He has supported most of the EU’s sanctions against Russia since it invaded Ukraine, but has resisted going further and pitched himself as a peacemaker to voters.\n\nOn Wednesday, his foreign minister accused Ukraine’s government of coordinating with Hungary’s opposition parties, without citing evidence.\n\nThe opposition criticized him for his stance. “Putin is rebuilding the Soviet empire and Orban is just watching it with strategic calm,” opposition leader Marki-Zay said at a rally in March, Reuters reported.\n\nBut Marki-Zay conceded defeat late on Sunday, telling supporters: “We don’t debate the victory of Fidesz, but we debate that this election was democratic and even.\n\n“We will stay in this country, stand up for each other, hold hands and won’t let each other go. Hard times are coming, regardless of the election results. We know that they will blame us, we will be the scapegoats, so it’s more important than ever to hold each other’s hand and not let go.”\n\nEven before the invasion, Orban had a thorny relationship with the EU. His government has been lambasted by senior figures in the bloc over rule of law issues; earlier this year, Europe’s top court allowed the EU to block funding to Hungary and Poland for violating democratic rights.\n\nCrusading against Western liberal values has also formed a centerpiece of Orban’s premiership, and a referendum was also held Sunday on his controversial law that bans educational materials and programs for children that are considered to promote homosexuality and gender reassignment.\n\nLGBTQ rights groups encouraged voters to spoil their ballots, in order to prevent it from reaching the threshold of required to be considered valid. The tactic appeared to have worked; while those who responded sided mostly with the government, only 3.5 million valid votes were cast, short of the 4.1 million needed to validate the referendum.\n\nBut Orban’s law, which he frames as a “child protection” measure, is already in place and the ballot was seen as symbolic. Orban previously framed a 2016 referendum on migrant quotas as a victory even though it was similarly invalid, and human rights groups fear he will use the results of this ballot to further target the LGBTQ community.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Balint Bardi", "Rob Picheta", "Balint Bardi"], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/03/18/vladimir-putin-wins-election-opposition-the-excerpt-podcast/73015122007/", "title": "Vladimir Putin declared winner in election with no credible ...", "text": "On Monday's episode of The Excerpt podcast: Russian President Vladimir Putin wins another election.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Monday, March 18th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, the expected result of Russia's election. Plus, could either US presidential candidate drop out even if they wanted to? And why healthcare isn't a bigger issue on the campaign trail.\n\n♦\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has won reelection again. He won his fifth term with 87% of the vote according to the country's central election commission. Putin hailed his electoral victory as a sign of the country's trust and hope in him. Still, critics and activists have called the election a sham. Putin faced no credible opposition and cracked down on free speech. The name of Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, was at the center of elections this weekend. He mysteriously died at a Russian prison last month and long lines formed at some polling places in apparent support of a protest formed by the opposition.\n\nRussians abroad have also joined demonstrations outside Russian embassies around the world. Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya, joined a line at the embassy in Berlin as a crowd applauded and chanted her name. She said she wrote in her late husband's name on the ballot. In a post-election news conference, Putin surprisingly acknowledged being presented an offer of a prisoner swap that would've freed Navalny. He claims he was in favor of the deal while many in the international community have pointed to Putin for Navalny's death.\n\n♦\n\nSome voters may still be hoping that Joe Biden, Donald Trump, or both drop out of this year's presidential race. Could either do what Lyndon B. Johnson did nearly 56 years ago? I spoke with USA Today national political correspondent David Jackson for more. David, thanks for hopping on.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nHey, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo David, can you just remind us what happened when Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out back in the '60s and what led to his decision?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nOn March 31st, 1968, Lyndon Johnson at the end of a speech on the Vietnam War made the announcement that he would not be seeking reelection even though he was the favorite that particular year. So, immediate consequence was that he wasn't on the ballot that year. Vice President Hubert Humphrey replaced him, and that's the election that Richard Nixon won.\n\nBut he did it because he was under so much pressure over Vietnam and other issues. The country was quite divided back then. There was a lot of polarization and Johnson contributed to a lot of it. And he was concerned about his health and his age and some other things that we still hear about, and he decided that it just wasn't worth it. So, he sprung it on a nation that was really unprepared for it. And the end result is that that probably will never happen again.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid, how did LBJ dropping out influence elections in the years since?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nIn the short term it did because it allowed Vice President Hubert Humphrey to be nominated for president, even though he didn't run in a single primary that year. The primaries were less important at that point in time. There were only 15 of them that actually picked convention delegates. So, Humphrey was allowed to run for president without entering a primary, and yet, he still wound up with the nomination. And a lot of Democrats were very upset about that, especially after he lost the general election that year to Nixon.\n\nSo, after 1968, the Democratic Party organized the committee to reexamine the way that they picked their presidential candidates, and they came up with the system that we have today, the primaries and the caucuses. At that point, voters had more power to pick presidential candidate than party power brokers. It was a system that the Republicans also picked up, and it's the same deal that we have today. So, basically LBJ's decision to drop out of the race is what led to the current primary system that we have today.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd fast forwarding to today, David, is there any chance Biden or Trump would follow LBJ's lead? And could they even do so if they wanted to?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nNo, they couldn't. And the reason we wrote this story was because there are a lot of members of both parties who hope that their candidates do drop out. There are people who are concerned about Biden's age, people who are concerned about Trump's criminal liability and other factors, but the fact is that they aren't going to do it and there's really no way that they could do it, because they've already nailed down the nomination and it's the primary process that helped them do this.\n\nI mean, the way it's evolved, primaries provide special advantages to incumbents and to well-financed candidates. And Biden and Trump both fit those qualifications. So, they were basically able to use their money and their fame and their name identification to win primaries, rack up delegates. And so, they're now in an impregnable position, and as you say, they couldn't drop out if they wanted to.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid Jackson is a national political correspondent with USA Today. Great info as always. Thanks, David.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe great resignation appears to have fizzled out in parts of the economy. At its peak in the spring of 2022, a record 4.5 million workers a month or 3% of all US employees were leaving jobs. The pandemic spawned unprecedented labor shortages, forcing employers to beef up pay and benefits, and spurring workers to leave for other opportunities.\n\nAs the health crisis has faded, quitting and job switching have waned too. In January, 3.4 million or 2.1% of US workers left their jobs, slightly below the pre-COVID mark according to a labor department report this month. Experts have pointed to a cooling job market and that many have now already switched to jobs that better match their skills, interests, and salary requirements. But turnover has remained high in some industries. That includes in transportation and warehousing where truck driver shortages have intensified. And workers are still switching jobs at a high rate in other services like barbershops and car repair.

I spoke with USA Today health reporter Karen Weintraub, for more. Karen, thanks for making the time.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karen, how worried are Americans about healthcare and what are some of their biggest concerns?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThe vast majority of Americans are concerned about healthcare, particularly the cost of healthcare. Medical debt is the leading cause of debt in America, and a lot of people are concerned. Anybody who's had serious medical issues knows how crazy it is, really, how much time you have to spend on the phone, making appointments, dealing with appointments, dealing with insurance companies, fighting insurance companies. It's quite the catch 22 situation.\n\nSo, one example of the goofiness of our current system is this woman who I talked to, preventive medicine is covered under the current system, so she gets her mammogram for free, but because she has dense breasts, she always needs a follow-up ultrasound. And that ultrasound she has to pay for herself $200 out of pocket. And so, she can get the preventive care sort of, but not entirely. That's the system that we have right now. Same with colonoscopy. If it's a screening tool, you can get it, but once you have a hint that you might have a problem, a colonoscopy then is a diagnostic, it's not a screening tool and then you have to pay for it. So, our system really just doesn't work for a lot of people and it turns people off.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIn terms of where the presidential candidates stand on healthcare, let's just start with President Joe Biden. What are we hearing from him and what have we seen from him while in office?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo, he has spoken a lot about healthcare over the years. He's very committed to cancer care in particular. His son, Beau Biden died of brain cancer and he's talked about the cancer moonshot. He has talked a lot also about prescription drug prices. So, that's been his main target as president is lowering the price of drugs. The way he's negotiated it is these prices will come down starting mostly in 2026, although the price of insulin has come down already. But what he hasn't done, what the concern has been is that the healthcare system itself is not being changed by this.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Karen, how about challenger, former President Donald Trump. Has he made healthcare a part of his campaign strategy at all?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nIt hasn't been a big topic for him, no. He has talked recently about cuts to Medicare. He talks about waste in these federal programs. Biden says he's cutting the programs. He says he's cutting waste. I guess it's a question of what you define as wasteful spending.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nI'm curious, Karen, why experts believe candidates are not making healthcare a bigger player in this year's election? As you outlined, Americans really care about this issue a lot.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nIt's kind of a no-win situation, frankly. Obama put a ton of his political capital on changing the healthcare system, what we now call Obamacare, officially called the Affordable Care Act. And it really was basically the only major thing he was able to accomplish in his eight years in office because it cost him so much. It's a losing issue for politicians. If Obama hadn't accomplished that, he might not have accomplished anything at all, frankly, in his administration. Healthcare is one fifth of our economy, and there are a lot of people with a lot of money at stake in healthcare.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren, there will be tons of campaigning over the next few months. What will it take to push healthcare to the forefront on the campaign trail? Could patient activism help here?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah, I think that people mentioning it to the candidates, people bringing it up, patient advocacy typically does bring it up. Again, I think it's not an issue that a lot of candidates want to bring up on their own, so they need to be forced to bring it up, but it is an issue of high importance to a lot of the public, and so that's why we wanted to highlight it in our coverage.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren Weintraub covers health for USA Today. Thanks as always, Karen.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMarch Madness is here. The men's and women's college basketball tournament fields were announced yesterday.

Ahead of the vote, Bolsonaro and some of his allies had made unfounded claims about electoral fraud and unfair treatment by the press.\n\n“Anywhere else in the world, the president who lost would have called me by now and conceded,” Lula da Silva told supporters on Sunday night, explaining that he was “part happy, part worried” about the transfer of power.\n\n“He still hasn’t called, I don’t know if he will and I don’t know if he will concede,” he said.\n\nBut public concession or not, experts say it’s already out of the outgoing President’s hands.\n\nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks after the election results were announced on Sunday. Danilo Martins Yoshioka/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIt is Brazil’s Supreme Electoral Court that officially validates election results and communicates them to the Senate, Chamber of Deputies and State Assemblies.\n\nA press officer for the Electoral Court told CNN that the vote’s results are already considered validated, since the court’s declaration of the outcome on Sunday. A court session at a later point will formally confirm the win, but no date has been set for it yet, he said.\n\nElectoral Court President Alexandre de Moraes on Sunday personally called both Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro to inform them of the results and congratulate them on their participation in the democratic process, according to a press release by the Court.\n\nDe Moraes also said he did not see much room for the election to be contested. “The result has been proclaimed, accepted and those who were elected will take office on January 1,” he said in the release.\n\nJair Bolsonaro pictured on election day. Thiago Ribeiro/AGIF/Reuters\n\nBrazilian Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco has already publicly congratulated Lula da Silva and his supporters, as has Chamber of Deputies President Arthur Lira – a close Bolsonaro ally.\n\nForeign leaders from across the globe also swiftly expressed their support for Lula da Silva’s win.\n\n“I send my congratulations to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on his election to be the next president of Brazil following free, fair, and credible elections,” US President Joe Biden said after Sunday’s vote.\n\nAnd Russian President Vladimir Putin sent congratulations in a message reported by Russian state news agency TASS, adding: “The vote’s results confirm your high political authority.”\n\nThe President-elect’s diplomatic work is already underway, with Lula da Silva meeting Argentine President Alberto Fernandez – one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate him – in Sao Paulo on Monday.\n\nPrevious refusals to concede\n\nAt least twice before, Brazilian leaders have refused to participate in the transfer of power.\n\nAt the start of the Brazilian republic in the late 19th century, army marshall Floriano Peixoto did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Prudente de Moraes.\n\nAnd almost a century later, the last of the unelected military presidents, João Batista Figueiredo, snubbed the inauguration of his successor José Sarney.\n\nIn both cases, the boycott was largely symbolic. The same would be true if Bolsonaro were to refuse to concede the presidency in a public statement, according to legal expert Augusto de Arruda Botelho.\n\n“Not acknowledging the result is a non-starter from the political point of view, because at the end of the day, it is the Electoral Court that hands over power to the winner of the election,” he told CNN.\n\n“[Bolsonaro] can kick and scream as much as he wants,” he added.\n\nPlus it is in Bolsonaro’s political interest to appear the good sport, political scientist Camila Rocha told CNN.\n\nRocha’s reseach shows that refusing to concede would be damaging for Bolsonaro’s public image among his own supporters. “Even the most extreme pro-Bolsonaro supporters, like those I interviewed last year in Santa Catarina for my research, say that if Bolsonaro lost he would have to accept the result,” she told CNN.\n\n“So it is very clear that if Bolsonaro refuses to accept Lula’s victory, it could have a negative impact even among his supporters. He would certainly be perceived as a bad loser.”\n\nSupporters of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro blocking a highway near Abadiania, central Brazil.

Some people had left their taxis and had started walking along the side of the highway to reach the terminal, the crew said.

A number of flights have been delayed, according to an airline agent who spoke to CNN. Airline pilots and crew have not been able to make it to the airport because the blockade is causing significant delays at the airport, the agent told CNN.\n\nSome police officers on the road leading to the airport told CNN that they were afraid of upsetting the protesters and were trying to avoid confrontation.\n\nSeveral protesters have made clear they do not believe the election result.\n\n“We have a President that won at the ballot box and they defrauded the ballot boxes and put the other candidate ahead and we’re against that,” said Luis Valejo, a Bolsonaro supporter.\n\nAnother, Jurandir Santos, said that even if Bolsonaro accepts the results, “the people will not accept it.”\n\nIn the first public comments by any member of Bolsonaro’s inner circle since his election defeat, Bolsonaro’s son, Sen.

He and Le Pen advanced to the runoff after finishing in first and second place, respectively, among 12 candidates who ran in the first round on April 10.\n\nWhile the contest was a rematch of the 2017 French presidential runoff, much of Europe watched the election with unease. A Le Pen presidency would have fundamentally changed France’s relationship with the European Union and the West, at a time when the bloc and its allies rely on Paris to take a leading role in confronting some of the world’s biggest challenges – most notably, the war in Ukraine.\n\nAnd though Macron’s pitch to voters of a globalized, economically liberal France at the head of a muscular European Union won out over Le Pen’s vision for a radical shift inward, the 41.5% of people who voted for her put the French far right closer to the presidency than ever before.\n\nLe Pen’s performance is the latest indication that the French public is turning to extremist politicians to voice their dissatisfaction with the status quo. In the first round, far-left and far-right candidates accounted for more than 57% of the ballots cast.\n\nMany of those unsatisfied with the final two candidates stayed home. The voter abstention rate for the runoff was 28%, according to the French Interior Ministry, the highest in more than 50 years. In fact, more voters abstained than voted for Le Pen.\n\nMacron’s supporters, gathered on Champs de Mars in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in central Paris, broke out in massive cheers when the news was announced. The celebration was significantly lower-key than after Macron’s victory in 2017, though he did once again walk to deliver his speech to the European anthem, commonly referred to as the “Ode to Joy.”\n\nIn his victory speech, Macron vowed to be the “president for each and every one of you.” He then thanked his supporters and acknowledged that many, like in 2017, voted for him simply to block the extreme right.\n\nMacron said that his second term would not be a continuation of his first, committing to address all of France’s current problems.\n\nHe also addressed those who supported Le Pen directly, saying that he, as president, must find an answer to “the anger and disagreements” that led them to vote for the far right.\n\n“It will be my responsibility and that of those who surround me,” Macron said.\n\nLe Pen delivered a concession speech within a half hour of the first projection, speaking to her backers gathered at a pavilion in western Paris’ Bois de Boulogne.\n\n“A great wind of freedom could have blown over our country, but the ballot box decided otherwise,” Le Pen said.\n\nStill, Le Pen acknowledged the fact that the far right had never performed so well in a presidential election. She called the result “historic” and a “shining victory” that put her political party, National Rally, “in an excellent position” for June’s parliamentary elections.\n\n“The game is not quite over,” she said.\n\nA two week sprint to the finish\n\nMacron and Le Pen spent the last two weeks crisscrossing the country to woo those who did not vote for them in the first round.\n\nMacron had to convince voters to back him again despite a mixed record on domestic issues, like his handling of the yellow vest protests and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLe Pen’s campaign attempted to tap into public anger over a cost-of-living squeeze by campaigning hard on helping people cope with inflation and rising energy prices – a major concern for the French electorate – rather than relying on the anti-Islamist, anti-immigration and Euroskeptic positions that dominated her first two attempts at winning the presidency in 2017 and 2012.\n\nFrench far-right contender Marine Le Pen casts her vote in Henin-Beaumont, in northern France, on Sunday. Michel Spingler/AP\n\nShe presented herself as a more mainstream and less radical candidate, even though much of her manifesto remained the same as five years ago. “Stopping uncontrolled immigration” and “eradicating Islamist ideologies” were her manifesto’s two priorities, and analysts said many of her policies on the EU would have put France at odds with the bloc.\n\nThough Le Pen had abandoned some of her most controversial policy proposals, like leaving the European Union and the euro, her views on immigration and her position on Islam in France – she wants to make it illegal for women to wear headscarves in public – did not change.\n\n“I think that the headscarf is a uniform imposed by the Islamists,” she said during the one and only presidential debate Wednesday. “I think that the great majority of the women who wear one can’t do otherwise in reality, even if they don’t dare say so.”\n\nBut Vladimir Putin was perhaps her biggest political liability. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Le Pen was a vocal supporter of the Russian President, even visiting him during her 2017 campaign. Her party also took out a loan from a Russian-Czech bank several years ago that it is still repaying.\n\nThough she has since condemned Moscow’s invasion, Macron attacked Le Pen on her previous positions during the debate. He argued that she could not be trusted to represent France when dealing with the Kremlin.\n\n“You’re speaking to your banker when you’re talking to Russia. That’s the problem,” Macron said during the debate. “You cannot properly defend the interests of France on this subject because your interests are linked to people close to the Russian power.”\n\nLe Pen said her party was forced to seek funding abroad because no French bank would approve the loan request, but the defense seemingly failed to resonate.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger Joseph Ataman", "Joshua Berlinger", "Joseph Ataman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/03/14/russian-presidential-elections-explained/72947914007/", "title": "How long has Putin been president? How Russian elections work", "text": "Exactly one month after the suspicious death of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, in a penal colony, the country gears up for its presidential election. Four candidates are in the race, and voting will happen Friday to Sunday. Putin, 71, is expected to claim his fifth tenure.\n\nBacked by state-run media and an intensified crackdown on free speech and public dissent, Putin’s approval rating inside Russia has reached 80% ahead of the vote, according to the Levada Center, a Russian nongovernmental polling and sociological research organization.\n\nIt is not clear, however, how popular the president really is, considering that citizens are afraid of opposing the regime. Research has shown that pressure to conform helps account for Putin’s large approval increase after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and the same happened after the invasion of the rest of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nWho is running against Vladimir Putin?\n\nRussia’s registration of candidates closed on Feb 10, with Putin and three other candidates approved for the ballot. All the candidates support the war in Ukraine, and the most outspoken anti-war candidate, Boris Nadezhdin, was barred from running because of “flaws in the collection of signatures,” according to the Russian Central Election Commission.\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\n\nHow does this election echo abroad?\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Navalny, has accused Putin of having her husband murdered and called on the European Union to refuse to recognize the results of the vote, saying that “a president who assassinated his main political opponent cannot be legitimate by definition.\"\n\nWestern leaders, including President Joe Biden, also have blamed Putin for Navalny's death and warned of consequences. They have provided no evidence.\n\nFor the first time, elections also will take place in what Russia calls its new territories − parts of Ukraine now controlled by Russian forces. Baltic NATO countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania criticize that in a joint statement, calling Russia’s plan to hold elections in \"temporarily occupied and illegally annexed\" Ukrainian territory \"a grave violation of international law, the UN Charter, and Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.\"\n\nHow do presidential elections work in Russia?\n\nThe president is elected by a popular vote in a two-round system every six years. The original 1993 Russian Constitution specified a four-year term, but in 2008, Dmitry Medvedev, who was president between Putin’s tenures from 2008 to 2012, passed an amendment extending the term by two years.\n\nIf no one wins an absolute majority in the first election, a second round is held between the two leading contenders, and the winner is required to win more than 50% of the vote. Elected presidents have a two-term limit.\n\nSo why can Putin run again?\n\nThe 2008 Medvedev amendment wasn’t the only constitutional change. A constitutional referendum in 2020 effectively allowed Putin to run for a further two six-year terms after 2024 by removing “in a row” from the article regulating presidential term limits. That discounted his previous and current terms and made it possible for Putin to theoretically remain in the Kremlin until 2036 instead of having to step down this year.\n\nThe amendment also placed the Russian Constitution above international law.\n\nHow long has Putin been president of Russia?\n\nAfter working as a KGB agent in Dresden, East Germany, from 1985 to 1990, Putin returned to Russia and switched careers, working in administration in St. Petersburg and later Moscow. In 1999, he was appointed prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nWhen Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, Putin was handed the presidency on the last day of 1999 and has since been leader of the Russian Federation for longer than any other ruler since Josef Stalin, besting even Leonid Brezhnev’s 1964-1982 tenure.\n\nAre elections in Russia free?\n\nAccording to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observers, the last presidential election in Russia in 2018 was well-administered but restricted in terms of fundamental freedoms and lack of competition.\n\nThe OSCE report stated that “while candidates could generally campaign freely, the extensive and uncritical coverage of the incumbent president in most media resulted in an uneven playing field,” and it added that media owned or supported by the state remains the dominant source of political information in Russia.\n\nApart from benefiting from preferential media treatment, Putin’s 2018 reelection campaign also benefited from procedural irregularities during the vote count and the disqualification of his most influential rival, Navalny, according to Freedom House, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that rates democracies across the world. Navalny was not allowed to run for office because of a politically motivated criminal conviction. Other prominent critics who could challenge Putin on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad.\n\nAfter the crackdown on free speech in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, most independent media organizations have been banned, many Russian journalists are in exile, and foreign correspondents have either been expelled or jailed, including The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich.\n\nPrevious election results\n\nWhat is the political system in Russia?\n\nThe 1993 Constitution established a semi-presidential system for the Russian Federation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/05/23/vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-presidential-election-respect/9480961/", "title": "Putin vows to 'respect' Ukraine vote", "text": "Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin pledged Friday to \"respect' the outcome of Ukraine's presidential election on Sunday, but his conciliatory words were received with skepticism by Washington analysts.\n\nThe Russian leader, speaking at an investment forum in St. Petersburg, slammed the West over its involvement in Ukraine – and its economic sanctions against Moscow – but said Russia is ready to work with the new leadership in Kiev.\n\n\"We understand that the people of Ukraine want their country to emerge from this crisis. We will treat their choice with respect,\" he said.\n\n\"It would have been better to hold a referendum and adopt a new constitution,\" Putin added. \"Under the current constitution (Viktor) Yanukovych is still in power.\"\n\nPutin on Monday announced that Russian troops were ordered to withdraw from near Ukraine's eastern border, which NATO says has yet to happen. He also called for a decrease in violence by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, while violence there has increased, said economist Anders Aslund of the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington.\n\nWhat Putin is really saying is \"we will cause as much trouble as we can without fully investing ourselves,\" Aslund said. \"If the elections work out then we will try something else.\"\n\nPutin will try to have it both ways, says Damon Wilson, an adviser on Russia and European affairs in the administrations of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, now at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.\n\nHe may \"respect\" Ukrainian elections because of their inevitability, meaning he will recognize Ukraine as a sovereign nation represented by a legitimate government. Wilson said. \"At the same time, it's disingenuous to think he'll not try to influence what's happening inside Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin will continue to push for federalization, a concept all Ukrainian presidential candidates have endorsed for improved efficiency, but that Putin seeks to reduce the central government's ability to function, Wilson said. He will continue to use energy and economics as a leverage of influence, and to try to buy members of parliament like he's done in the past, Wilson said.\n\nAnd Putin will keep in the wings both his forces across the border and special forces \"able to manipulate and wreak havoc inside Ukraine,\" Wilson said. \"That remains as a coercive thing over the head of Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin's statement is timed to forestall a next round of sanctions prepared by U.S. and European Union officials that would target broad sectors of Russia's banking and energy sectors that will be ready to implement as early as Monday, Wilson said, citing private conversations with U.S. officials.\n\nIf Putin means by \"respect\" that Moscow is prepared to work with Ukraine's new president, \"that's a fine thing, but we need to see how that results in practice,\" said Steve Pifer, a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under former president Bill Clinton. \"Will that mean Moscow is prepared to engage in a normal dialog with Kiev? Will it use its influence to get the armed separatists in Donetsk and Lugansk to stop what they're doing?\"\n\nThere's no evidence the Russians have used their influence to get the separatists to disarm in east Ukraine, or to allow elections to go forward in areas they control, Pifer said.\n\nThe elections scheduled for Sunday were part of an agreement, reached by Ukraine, Russia and members of the European Union, which ended massive protests in Kiev in February.\n\nUnder the agreement, Yanukovych, a Putin ally, would have remained in office until the voting. But after he hurriedly fled Kiev and was formally removed from office by Ukraine's parliament, Russia charged that he had been illegally ousted in a coup and distanced itself from the agreement.\n\nPutin's comments Friday were the first time since Russia's subsequent annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea that the Kremlin has reiterated its support for Ukraine's elections.\n\nHis remarks appeared to be aimed at trying to reassure an audience already skittish over the Ukraine crisis and its impact on economic relations between the West and Russia. The chief executives of more than three dozen international firms canceled their plans to attend the annual forum following appeals from the U.S. government to boycott the event.\n\nIn his public comments, Putin also called on the interim government in Kiev to end its military operation against pro-Russian separatists in the east who have seized government buildings and fought government troops for more than a month.\n\n\"(Armored personnel carriers) are firing there and journalists are being captured and detained … What are the conditions for holding the elections?\" he asked.\n\nPresident Obama's spokesman Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force one Friday that the White House would welcome Russian acceptance of the results of Ukraine's elections. But he too sounded a skeptical note.\n\n\"We'll have to see whether, in fact, Russia does recognize and then take steps to engage with the Ukrainian government and the victor of the presidential election,\" Carney said.\n\n\"W e further urge Russia to use its influence to persuade separatists in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere to vacate buildings they've occupied, to lay down their weapons, to cease the activities that they've engaged in that have caused violence and instability in those parts of Ukraine, and instead to participate in the democratic process,\" Carney said.\n\nIn the deadliest attack yet, pro-Russia insurgents attacked a military checkpoint and killed 16 soldiers Thursday, casting a shadow over the presidential vote.\n\nIn Kiev, Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, on Friday urged all voters to take part in the crucial ballot to \"cement the foundation of our nation.\"\n\n\"Today, we are building a new European country the foundation of which was laid by millions of Ukrainians who proved that they are capable of defending their own choice and their country,\" said Turchynov, who is not running for president.\n\n\"We will never allow anyone to rob us of our freedom and independence, turn our Ukraine into a part of the post-Soviet empire.\"\n\nPutin's remarks were the latest in what appeared to be steps -- at least in public -- by the Kremlin in the past two weeks to ease the crisis over Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader had called for separatists to postpone their vote on secession and said he had ordered Russian troops massed at the border to withdraw from the border and return to their bases.\n\nAlthough the separatists went ahead with their independence vote and claimed overwhelming support in the areas heavily populated by ethnic Russians, Moscow -- unlike in Crimea -- has not taken steps to annex the area.\n\nSunday's elections may be a turning point because \"nobody can argue after decent democratic elections that Ukraine doesn't have a legitimate government,\" Aslund said. \"The whole Russian argument becomes obviously incorrect…. this would make it so Russia cannot continue to create chaos in Ukraine.\"\n\nSeparatists will prevent about half the voters in Ukraine's eastern region, which represent 14% of Ukraine's voters, from reaching polls, Aslund said. The remainder of Ukraine's elections are likely to be well-run, with high voter participation and a large international observer presence – meaning Putin will be hard pressed to challenge their legitimacy, he said.\n\nYet, Putin \"is a very good improviser\" who might back off a little but he won't stop trying to influence Ukraine,\" where he has invested heavily, Aslund said. \"He will try to work on Ukraine in another way, there are so many Russian agents in Ukraine that this won't be very hard.\"\n\nUkrainian security services have arrested 20 Russian agents. They have published a trove of phone calls between Russian operatives in Ukraine receiving orders from five Russian military intelligence centers. And several leaders of separatists in the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Lugansk and Donetsk are known Russian citizens, including Igor Strelkopf, commander of the so-called People's Republic of Donetsk, is a Russian GRU colonel, Aslund said.\n\nPutin also used the economic forum as an opportunity to discuss the West's policy of targeted economic sanctions against Russia, which he said was illegal and \"destabilizes the situation in our relations with the U.S. and the European Union.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, we felt the impact of the sanctions, we should be frank about that,\" he said in response to a question on a panel, but stressed that they had \"no systemic impact on our economy.\"\n\nIn a slap at the West over the Ukraine dispute, Putin said Russia is \"going to focus on Eurasian investment\" from now on, according to Putin.\n\nGazprom, the state-backed gas giant, signed a 30-year, $400 billion deal this week to supply gas to China.\n\nRussia is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, but the crisis over Ukraine has prompted Europe to begin to seek other suppliers.\n\nThe Kremlin leader told the forum that the current crisis over Ukraine, and its threat to European gas supply, is \"not due to Russia but to the situation in the Ukraine, which abuses its position.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/brittney-griner-released/index.html", "title": "WNBA star Brittney Griner released from Russian detention in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention, President Joe Biden said Thursday.\n\nGriner was released in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\n“She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home,” Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner’s wife, Cherelle. “After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that Griner’s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan’s family “have to have such mixed emotions today.”\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nGriner’s February arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the same time that the US enacted crippling sanctions in response to the Ukraine war, US diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations to try to secure the release of both Griner and Whelan.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said.\n\nThe prisoner swap occurred in Abu Dhabi Thursday, according to senior Biden administration officials. A joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nAsked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next “24 hours.” As for what he would say to Whelan’s family, he said, “We’re speaking to them.”\n\nCherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”\n\nBoth she and Brittney Griner “will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,” she added.\n\nThe Griner family echoed those sentiments in a statement Thursday night.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers - including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the family said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch President Biden give remarks after Brittney Griner release 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nWhelan told CNN in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where is being held in a remote part of Russia that he was “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far – and didn’t rule out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.”\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\n“This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,” tweeted House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable.”\n\nGriner – who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\n‘The only deal we could make right now’\n\nMonths and months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in Thursday’s prisoner swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in recent weeks that an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s release.\n\nThe final deal itself came together over the past 48 hours, the officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence.\n\nThat opening, while a significant breakthrough, was still a “painful” one, the officials said: in exchange for a convicted arms dealer, Russia would only agree to release Griner, leaving another American – Whelan – behind. In multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nBiden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official said. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brittney Griner's wife speaks about WNBA star's release 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said, because Russia said it has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.\n\nThe Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nIn the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.\n\n“It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,” the US official said.\n\nThe official says that was a “difficult decision” for Biden, but again, one he felt he had to make.\n\nGriner was moved from the penal colony to Moscow within the last 48 hours. Thursday morning, she boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates. Upon arriving there, she was met on the tarmac by US officials, including special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens. She was in “an extremely upbeat mood” and “all smiles” and “grateful.”\n\nWhelan family ‘devastated’\n\nWhelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a “sweatshop.”\n\nWhelan’s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are “devastated” that he was left behind.\n\n“It’s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, said on “CNN This Morning.” “But we do worry about what’s in Paul’s future. I think it’s become clear that the US doesn’t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I’m not really sure what the future holds.”\n\nThe Biden administration told Whelan’s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.\n\nIn an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was “devastated” at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won’t survive the rest of his sentence.\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news, according to senior administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, after the US secured the release of Trevor Reed, another American who’d been detained in Russia since 2019, Paul Whelan expressed frustration through a statement shared by his parents.\n\n“Why was I left behind?” Whelan said in April. “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in Russia 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of Death’ included in swap\n\nBout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nIt was a US decision to have the exchange happen in Abu Dhabi, an official familiar with the discussion said. “Russia was happy with it,” then UAE facilitated and provided the venue.\n\nWhen Putin and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, met in Russia in October, one of the issues they discussed was prisoner exchanges, and there was an agreement that the UAE could be helpful on the topic, a senior UAE official told CNN.\n\nThe US was aware that MBZ planned to raise the topic with Putin and there was nothing but encouragement from the US side, the official said.\n\n“There was criticism of the Putin meeting at the time. But that meeting is part of the reason that Griner was released today,” the official said.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Biden thanked the United Arab Emirates for its help with the exchange.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap. The statement said that the “success of the mediation efforts is a reflection of the mutual and solid friendship that connects both countries with the United States of America, and the Russian Federation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch interview with Viktor Bout 13 years ago from Thai jail after US sting operation 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked about the role of Saudi Arabia, US officials suggested a number of countries were involved.\n\n“We have and I’m sure we’ll continue to lean on partners around the world to work this through with us and to give us their ideas and to impress upon the Russians how important it is to us to resolve these sorts of cases. We appreciate when those partners do help us,” an administration official said.\n\nBout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Moscow had slammed his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased” and Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nSteve Zissou, Bout’s lawyer in the US, told CNN on Thursday that the prisoner swap between Griner and his client was “fair.”\n\n“As I have urged for some time, given the 15 long years that Viktor Bout has been in custody since the United States government targeted him in 2006, his exchange for Brittney Griner, who has only been in custody for a few months, is fair,” Zissou said in a statement.\n\nZissou told CNN said that his legal team knew a swap was imminent 24 hours ago.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Mj Lee Kevin Liptak", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/politics/us-troops-ukraine-russia-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Why the US isn't sending troops into Ukraine | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nWashington CNN —\n\nRussia’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day, has faced universal condemnation from Western powers.\n\nSanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine have come from many directions. But putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, is a line that the US and other Western allies have not been willing to cross.\n\nSoldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division wait in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, before deploying to Europe on February 14. Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that the Biden administration “has made clear” the US will not “put boots on the ground.”\n\n“We’re not going to put American troops in danger,” she said.\n\nBut what other factors are keeping US troops out of Ukraine? Here’s what you need to know:\n\nWhy won’t the US send troops into Ukraine?\n\nThough the US has condemned Russia’s actions at every chance, President Joe Biden has gone to great lengths to make clear that US forces will not enter Ukraine and engage Russia directly.\n\nWhy’s that? As Biden told NBC News earlier this month, “That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.” In other words, the US’ entrance into the conflict has the potential to touch off a global war.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, told What Matters on Sunday, “The key to diplomacy is to limit the potential for war. While the current war of Russian illegal invasion into Ukraine is tragic, chaotic and devastating, it is still a regional conflict.”\n\n“If NATO or the US sent troops into Ukraine to help them fight the Russians, the dynamic would shift to a multinational conflict with potential global implications due to the nuclear power status of both US and Russia. Because of that, the US and NATO — and other nations around the world — are attempting to influence the success of Ukraine and the defeat of Russia by providing other types of support,” Hertling said.\n\nWhat about the US troops in Europe?\n\nThe US has deployed thousands of troops throughout Europe, both before and during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCNN’s Barbara Starr reported Sunday that more than 4,000 US Army troops who deployed to Europe on a temporary basis will now have their tour of duty extended – most likely for several weeks – as part of the US effort to reassure east European allies during the current crisis.\n\nBut those troops are not there to fight the Russians.\n\nUS forces “are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said from the White House Thursday.\n\nRather, US troops are tasked with defending “our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” Biden added.\n\nIs there any scenario where the US would engage Russia directly?\n\nUkraine borders the NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Russia threatened one of these countries, the US – along with France, Germany, the UK and the rest of the 30-member NATO alliance – would be required by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to respond.\n\nArticle 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation. The first and only time it has been invoked was in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US; as a result, NATO allies joined the invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nWill American troops help create a no-fly zone in Ukraine?\n\nThe United States will not put US pilots in the air to create a no-fly zone in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday.\n\nThe Biden administration’s posture of keeping US forces out of Ukraine means “we’re not going to put American troops in the air as well, but we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves,” she said.\n\nWhile some Ukrainian officials have called on NATO countries to “close the sky” over Ukraine, establishing a no-fly zone would put the US in direct engagement with the Russian military which the White House has made clear it is not interested in doing.\n\nHow else is the US helping Ukraine?\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday he has authorized $350 million in new US military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n“Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,” the top US diplomat said in a statement.\n\nPrevious drawdowns have been for $60 million and $250 million, putting the total over the last year at more than a billion dollars, according to an administration official.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken announced Sunday that the US is sending nearly $54 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to assist those affected by Russia’s invasion.\n\nHow has the US punished Russia?\n\nIn a word, sanctions.\n\nThe US and Western countries have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting its banking, aerospace and technology sectors. These sanctions enact penalties across industries, including:\n\nAsset freezes for the largest banks\n\nDebt and equity restrictions on critical mining, transportation and logistics firms\n\nA large-scale effort to shut down access to critical technology for key Russian military and industrial sectors\n\nOn Friday, the US – along with the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada – announced it would impose sanctions directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the US and the European Commission, along with France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada, announced they would expel certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\n“Sanctions, blockades, economic influence, building of alliances against Putin’s actions while simultaneously supplying Ukraine with weapons and other aide will hopefully prevent escalations and unintended worldwide consequences,” Hertling said.\n\nWhere does public opinion sit?\n\nAs we wrote about last week, Americans are wary of US intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to polls taken in the run-up to Russia’s invasion.\n\nIn an AP-NORC poll, just 26% of Americans believed the US should play a major role in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. About half, 52%, said it should play a minor role and another 20% that it should play no role at all.\n\nOne-third of Democrats (32%) and 22% of Republicans wanted the US to play a major role. Independents were most likely to say the US should play no role; 32% felt that way, compared with 22% among Republicans and 14% among Democrats.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThomas-Greenfield said Sunday that the US has “not taken anything off the table” when asked about targeting the Russian energy sector with sanctions, which so far has not happened.\n\n“We’re ramping up as the Russians ramp up, so there’s more to come,” she told Bash.\n\nUS and European officials have discussed targeting the Russian Central Bank with sanctions, a step without precedent for an economy of Russia’s size. Thomas-Greenfield did not give precise timing for that but said, “This is happening very, very quickly.”\n\nThe scale of the central bank sanctions are still under discussion and could have even more bite than officials have telegraphed, CNN’s Phil Mattingly has reported.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Sunday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/02/27"}]}

Using this as a pretext to smear China is unacceptable.” Instead, China has claimed the facilities are administrative hubs, set up to help Chinese expatriates with tasks like renewing their driver’s licenses. China has also said the offices were a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had left many citizens locked down in other countries and locked out of China, unable to renew documentation.\n\nWhen approached by CNN last month about Safeguard Defenders’ original allegations, China’s foreign affairs ministry said the overseas stations were staffed by volunteers. However, the organization’s latest report claims one police network it examined had hired 135 people for its first 21 stations.\n\nThe organization also sourced a three-year contract for a worker hired at an overseas station in Stockholm.\n\nUndeclared consular activities outside of a nation’s official diplomatic missions are highly unusual and illegal, unless a host nation has given their explicit consent, and the Safeguard Defenders report claims China’s overseas offices predate the pandemic by several years.\n\nTheir reports have prompted investigations in at least 13 different countries so far and enflamed an increasingly heated diplomatic tussle between China and nations like Canada, home to a large Chinese diaspora.\n\nChina isn’t the only superpower to be accused of employing extrajudicial means to reach targets for law enforcement or for the purposes of political persecution abroad.\n\nRussia, for instance, has on two occasions been accused of deploying lethal chemical and radioactive substances on British soil to try to assassinate its former spies – allegations Russia has always denied.\n\nIn the United States, the CIA was embroiled in a scandal over the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects from the streets of Italy to Guantanamo Bay after 9/11.\n\nYet the suggestion of widescale repression of Chinese citizens in foreign countries comes at a pivotal time for a nation contending with its own unrest at home, amid fatigue at the country’s restrictive zero-Covid policy, as leader Xi Jinping’s third term in power gets under way. Last week, China indicated it would loosen some of its pandemic restrictions, three years after the onset of Covid-19.\n\nAs the second largest economy in the world, China has developed a deepening relationship with many of the countries where the new police stations have been allegedly found, raising awkward questions for national governments balancing commercial interests against national security.\n\nChina signs police patrol agreements with nations\n\nItaly, which signed a series of bilateral security deals with China over successive governments since 2015, has kept largely silent during the revelations of alleged activities on its soil.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 Italian police conducted multiple joint patrols with Chinese police – first in Rome and Milan – and later in other cities including Naples where at the same time, Safeguard Defenders says, it has found evidence that a video surveillance system was added to a Chinese residential area ostensibly “to effectively deter crimes there.”\n\nIn 2016, an Italian police official told NPR that joint policing would “lead to a wider international cooperation, exchange of information and sharing resources to combat the criminal and terrorist groups that afflict our countries.”\n\nThe NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence.\n\nOne ceremony in Rome to mark the opening of a new station was attended by Italian police officials in 2018, according to videos posted on Chinese websites, demonstrating the close ties between police forces in the two countries.\n\nA Chinese national flag is flown at half-staff to mourn the death of former leader Jiang Zemin at the Chinese Embassy in Italy on November 30, 2022. The NGO determines Italy has hosted 11 Chinese police stations, including in Venice and in Prato, near Florence. Jin Mamengni/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the Italian newspaper La Nazione reported local investigations into one of the stations had not unearthed any illegal activity. Il Foglio quoted police chiefs as saying recently that the stations did not present any particular concern as they appeared to be merely bureaucratic.\n\nItaly’s foreign and interior ministries did not reply to questions from CNN.\n\nChina also struck similar joint police patrol agreements with Croatia and Serbia between 2018 and 2019 as part of the nation’s increasing strategic footprint along the path of Xi’s defining foreign policy, dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChinese officers were seen on a joint patrol with their Croatian counterparts on the streets of the capital Zagreb as recently as July of this year, Chinese media reported.\n\nA Zagreb police official interviewed by Xinhua said the patrols were essential for “protecting and attracting foreign tourists.”\n\nA 2019 report from Reuters said Chinese officers had joined Serbian officers on patrol in Belgrade to help address the influx of Chinese tourists. One Serbian officer noted the Chinese didn’t have the power to make arrests.\n\nSafeguard Defenders also says Chinese stations were able to get a toehold in South Africa, and in nearby nations thanks to a similar accord with Pretoria, in place for years.\n\nChina began laying the foundations for closer policing ties with South Africa’s law enforcement agencies almost two decades ago, later setting up a network of what are officially called “Overseas Chinese Service Centers” in cooperation with the government of South Africa thanks to successive bilateral security agreements.\n\nChina’s consulate in Cape Town has said the plan “unites all the communities, both South Africans and foreign citizens in South Africa.”\n\nSince its establishment, the framework “has been actively preventing crimes against the community and reducing the number of cases significantly,” the consulate has said while noting that the centers are non-profit associations with no “law enforcement authority.”\n\nSouth African government officials have frequently been featured by Chinese media expressing support for the centers and saying their work has helped police deepen their relationship with Chinese expatriates who live there, according to a 2019 report from the Jamestown China Brief.\n\nCNN reached out to the South African Police Service, but it has not yet received comment.\n\nChina tries to return people against their will\n\nSafeguard Defenders stumbled on the police networks while trying to assess the scale of China’s efforts to persuade some of its people to return to China even against their will, which, based on official Chinese data, could number almost a quarter of a million people around the world during the time Xi has been in power.\n\n“What we see coming from China is increasing attempts to crack down on dissent everywhere in the world, to threaten people, harass people, make sure that they are fearful enough so that they remain silent or else face being returned to China against their will,” said Safeguard Defenders Campaign director Laura Harth.\n\n“It will start with phone calls. They might start to intimidate your relatives back in China, to threaten you, do everything really to coax the targets abroad to come back. If that doesn’t work, they will use covert agents abroad. They will send them from Beijing and use methods such as luring and entrapment,” Harth said.\n\nThe French interior ministry declined to comment on the allegation that a Chinese citizen was coerced into returning home by a Chinese police station in a Paris suburb.\n\nReports spark anger and investigations\n\nThe revelations have prompted vocal outrage in some countries and a conspicuous silence in others.\n\nLast month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Homeland Security Committee he was deeply concerned about the revelations. “It is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let’s say, without proper coordination. It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes,” he said.\n\nIreland has shut down the Chinese police station found on its territory, while the Netherlands, which has taken similar measures, has a probe underway, as does Spain.\n\nHarth told CNN the organization will likely find more stations in the future. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,” she said.\n\n“China is not hiding what it is doing. They expressly say that they are going to expand these operations so let’s take that seriously.\n\n“This is a moment when countries have to consider that it’s a question of upholding the rule of law and human rights in their countries as much for people from China, as for everyone else around the world,” she said.", "authors": ["Nina Dos Santos"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

It said that according to national security prosecution investigations, some of those arrested have allegedly sent videos calling for protests over social messaging apps. Some were also charged with abuse of social media, spreading false news and joining terrorist organizations – a repressive charge commonly used by the security apparatus against activists.\n\nIndian climate activist Ajit Rajagopal was detained in Cairo last Sunday after setting off on a protest walk from the Egyptian capital to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the COP27 conference will be held from November 6 to 18. Rajagopal was released after a brief detention in Cairo along with his friend, lawyer Makarios Lahzy, a Facebook post by Lahzy said. Reuters, which spoke to Rajagopal following his release Monday, cited the Indian activist as saying he was still trying to get accredited for COP27 but did not plan to resume his march.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nEgypt went through two mass uprisings in 2011 and 2013 which eventually paved the way for then-military chief Sisi to take power. Thousands of activists have since been jailed, spaces for public expression have been quashed and press freedom diminished.\n\nWhile protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt, a looming economic crisis and a brutal security regime have spurred renewed calls for demonstrations by dissidents seeking to exploit a rare window of opportunity presented by the climate summit.\n\nOne jailed activist, British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abdelfattah, escalated his hunger strike in an Egyptian prison this week, amid warnings by relatives over his deteriorating health. “Alaa has been on hunger strike for 200 days, he’s been surviving on only 100 calories of liquid a day,” said Sanaa Seif, Abdelfattah’s sister, who is staging a sit-in outside the UK Foreign Office in London.\n\nA place for dialogue\n\nCOP, the annual UN-sponsored climate summit that brings together the signatories of the Paris Agreement on combating climate change, is traditionally a place where representatives of civil society have an opportunity to mingle with experts and policy makers and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see a young activist approaching a national delegation walking down the corridor to their next meeting or an indigenous leader chatting to a minister on the sidelines of a debate.\n\nAnd while security is always strict – this is, after all, a gathering attended by dozens of heads of states and governments – peaceful protests have always been part of COP. Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of last year’s host city of Glasgow, Scotland, during the summit.\n\nYet Egypt has tightened the rules on who can access the talks.\n\nAs in the past, this year’s COP conference will take place across two different sites. The official part of the summit is run by the UN and is only accessible to accredited people, including the official delegations, representatives of NGOs and other civil society groups, experts, journalists and other observers.\n\nThen there is a separate public venue where climate exhibitions and events take place throughout the two weeks of the summit. But while this public part of the summit was in the past open to anyone, people wishing to attend this year will need to register ahead of time.\n\nThe chance to protest will also be restricted.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government has pledged to allow demonstrations, it has said protests will have to take place in a special “protest zone,” a dedicated space away from the main conference site, and will have to be announced in advance. Guidelines published on the official COP website say that any other marches would need to be specially approved.\n\nAnyone wanting to organize a protest will need to be registered for the public part of the conference – a requirement that may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\nRights groups sound alarm\n\nThe UN has urged Egypt to ensure the public has a say at the conference.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said it was “essential that everyone – including civil society representatives – is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh” and that decisions about climate change need to be “transparent, inclusive and accountable.”\n\nSeparately, a group of five independent human rights experts, all of them UN special rapporteurs, published a statement last month expressing alarm over restrictions ahead of the summit. They said the Egyptian government had placed strict limits on who can participate in the talks and how, and said that “a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists.”\n\n“This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt,” the group said in a statement.\n\nA group of Egyptian civil rights groups has launched a petition calling for the Egyptian authorities to end the prosecutions of civil society activists and organizations and end restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n\n“The Egyptian authorities have for years employed draconian laws, including laws on counter terrorism, cyber crimes, and civil society, to stifle all forms of peaceful dissent and shut down civic space,” the groups said in the petition.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth and scores of other groups have also spoken up, demanding the release of detained activists.\n\nIn the lead-up to the climate conference, the Egyptian government presented an initiative pardoning prisoners jailed for their political activity. Authorities also pointed to a new prison, Badr-3, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Cairo, where other prisoners were moved to purportedly better conditions.\n\nBut rights groups said the government’s initiatives amounted to little change.\n\n“Ahead of COP27, Egypt’s PR machine is operating on all cylinders to conceal the awful reality in the country’s jails, where prisoners held for political reasons are languishing in horrific conditions violating the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.\n\n“Prisoners are facing the same human rights violations that have repeatedly blighted older institutions, exposing the lack of a political will from the Egyptian authorities to bring an end to the human rights crisis in the country.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Protests erupt across China in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping! Step down, Communist Party!” some protesters yelled among hundreds who gathered in the financial hub Shanghai – one of multiple major cities where protests broke out following a deadly fire Thursday at an apartment block in the far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe fire appeared to act as a catalyst for searing public anger over China’s strict zero-Covid measures after videos emerged that seemed to suggest lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom Shanghai to the capital Beijing, residents gathered to grieve the 10 people killed in the blaze in Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, speak out against zero-Covid and call for freedom and democracy. On dozens of university campuses, students demonstrated or put up protest posters. In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent. But three years into the pandemic, many people have been pushed to the brink by the government’s incessant use of lockdowns, Covid tests and quarantines – as well as ever-tightening censorship and continued onslaught on personal freedoms.\n\nThe ratcheting-up of restrictions in recent months, coupled with a series of heartbreaking deaths blamed on an over-zealous policing of the controls, has brought matters to a head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver!

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night.

Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing.

Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time. CDC recommends that people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings.”\n\nThe developments added fresh confusion to masking policies nationwide, with several airlines and travel authorities quickly announcing Monday evening that masks are now optional. It is unclear if the Justice Department will seek an order halting the ruling and file an appeal.\n\nJust last week, the CDC extended this mask mandate through May 3. The masking requirement applied to airplanes, trains and other forms of public transportation.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Monday afternoon that it was a “disappointing” decision, and the Justice Department will make any determinations about a legal response.\n\nConfusion in wake of ruling\n\nIn the immediate wake of Mizelle’s ruling, Psaki told reporters that the White House wasn’t trying to “provoke uncertainty with passengers” by not providing an immediate response, but added that the administration continues to recommend that airline passengers continue to wear masks.\n\n“So, we would say to anyone sitting out there – we recommend you wear masks on the airplane and … as soon as we can provide an update from here, hopefully soon, we’ll provide that to all of you,” she said.\n\nFollowing the ruling, several US airlines – Delta, United and Southwest among them – said masks are now optional on their aircraft. In a statement, Alaska Airlines said that passengers whose behavior was “particularly egregious” over the past two years in objecting to the mandate will remain banned from flying on the airline, “even after the mask policy is rescinded.”\n\nAmtrak and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates DC’s Metro, also announced that they will no longer require masks for passengers and employees, though the state-owned and operated NJ Transit and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority will keep their requirements.\n\nA Biden administration official familiar with the White House’s decision previously told CNN the goal of the extension was to gather more information and understanding of the BA.2 variant of the coronavirus. Covid-19 cases in the US are on the rise, leading universities and the City of Philadelphia to reimplement indoor mask mandates.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said last week that part of the reason for the extension of the transportation mask mandate was because of rising Covid-19 cases and settings created by travel.\n\n“We bring a lot of people together in a closed setting for a prolonged period of time, and not everyone has the option to not travel,” Murthy said on SiriusXM’s Doctor Radio’s Doctor Radio Reports, giving examples such as traveling on a plane to see a sick mother or traveling for work to keep a job. “Because it’s not necessarily an optional setting for people and because, again, folks are together for a long period of time, that’s why the CDC has leaned into being cautious there and recommending that people continue to wear those masks.”\n\nJudge compares enforcement to ‘detention and quarantine’\n\nThe first part of the judge’s 59-page ruling turned on the meaning of the word “sanitation,” as it functions in the 1944 statute that gives the federal government the authority – in its efforts to combat communicable diseases – to issue regulations concerning “sanitation.”\n\nMizelle concluded that that the use of the word in the statute was limited to “measures that clean something.”\n\nJudge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle sworn in by Justice Clarence Thomas, This photo was tweeted by Laura Rosenbury, dean of the University of Florida's Levin College of Law, in October 2021. From Laura Rosenbury/Twitter\n\n“Wearing a mask cleans nothing,” she wrote. “At most, it traps virus droplets. But it neither ‘sanitizes’ the person wearing the mask nor ‘sanitizes’ the conveyance.”\n\nShe wrote that the mandate fell outside of the law because “the CDC required mask wearing as a measure to keep something clean – explaining that it limits the spread of COVID-19 through prevention, but never contending that it actively destroys or removes it.”\n\nMizelle suggested that the government’s implementation of the mandate – in which non-complying travelers are “forcibly removed from their airplane seats, denied board at the bus steps, and turned away at the train station doors” – was akin to “detention and quarantine,” which are not contemplated in the section of the law in question, she said.\n\n“As a result, the Mask Mandate is best understood not as sanitation, but as an exercise of the CDC’s power to conditionally release individuals to travel despite concerns that they may spread a communicable disease (and to detain or partially quarantine those who refuse),” she wrote. “But the power to conditionally release and detain is ordinarily limited to individuals entering the United States from a foreign country.”\n\nShe added that the mandate also did not fit with a section of the law that would allow for detention of a traveler if he was, upon examination, found to infected.\n\n“The Mask Mandate complies with neither of these subsections,” the judge said. “It applies to all travelers regardless of their origins or destinations and makes no attempt to sort based on their health.”\n\nMizelle added that, additionally, the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates the procedures the federal government must follow when implementing certain agency policies.\n\nThe Biden administration erred in failing to seek public notice and comment on the policy, she wrote. She also ruled that the mandate violates that APA’s prohibitions on “arbitrary” and “capricious” agency actions because the CDC had failed to adequately explain its reasoning for implementing the policy.\n\nMizelle was appointed to the federal court in late 2020 by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nHer confirmation in the days after the 2020 election was controversial and uniformly opposed by Democrats. A former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Mizelle was 33 at the time of her confirmation. She had been rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association for “the short time she has actually practiced law and her lack of meaningful trial experience.”\n\nPrevious lawsuits had failed\n\nOther lawsuits that have been filed targeting the mandate – and the directive to enforce it by the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration – have failed to succeed in blocking it.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department filing submitted last week in a separate lawsuit against mandate the brought in Texas, “many other individuals have sought time-sensitive injunctive relief from the CDC or TSA orders that require masks during commercial air travel.”\n\n“The Supreme Court has thrice rejected that relief, and so has every Court of Appeals to consider the issue – that is, the Fourth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits – as well as the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida,” the Justice Department said in that case, referring to an earlier lawsuit brought in Florida’s Middle District. “No court has granted such relief, and not a single Judge or Justice has noted their dissent from any of these orders.”\n\nUnlike those other cases where judges were weighing emergency or preliminary orders, Mizelle was considering the legality of the mandate on the merits.\n\nFlight attendants union urges ‘calm’\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, the Association of Flight Attendants urged “calm and consistency in the airports and on planes.”\n\n“We urge focus on clear communication so that Flight Attendants and other frontline workers are not subject to more violence created by uncertainty and confusion,” the union, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants, said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans cheered the ruling, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posting on Twitter that it was “Great to see a federal judge in Florida follow the law and reject the Biden transportation mask mandate.”\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter that the ruling showed why his work on Trump judicial nominations was “so important to protect [individual] liberty” and “restraining [government] overreach.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, meanwhile, tweeted that a “Trump-appointed judge is obstructing our pandemic response and putting the most vulnerable at risk.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/29/donald-trump-supreme-court-immunity-case-takeaways/72786796007/", "title": "Supreme Court Trump immunity case: How the ruling could make ...", "text": "The Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's claim of immunity the week of April 22, which will further delay a trial that had been set in March.\n\nTrump contends presidents must have immunity from prosecution or they could be extorted with the threat of prosecution while in office.\n\nWASHINGTON − Former President Donald Trump welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to hear his argument for immunity from federal charges he tried to steal the 2020 election, but legal experts feared a broad protection from prosecution after leaving office could turn presidents into dictators.\n\nThe high court’s decision to hear the landmark case in April will delay the high-profile criminal trial for months. It's unclear whether the delay will push the trial beyond the November election.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that the charges are politically motivated. If he returns to the White House, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek to dismiss any pending federal charges. Trump could also simply pardon himself, although his power to do so is debated.\n\nWhatever the decision, the case could set new boundaries between the three branches of government by clarifying when former presidents can be tried in the courts under laws that Congress approved.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the high court’s decision to hear the case:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHow is Trump claiming immunity from prosecution?\n\nTrump faces four criminal cases for charges of election interference in federal court and in Georgia state court, for federal charges of mishandling classified documents and for New York charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money.\n\nIn the federal cases, Trump has argued he is completely immune from prosecution because crimes were charged for actions he took as president.\n\nHis lawyer, John Sauer, argued at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that former presidents are only vulnerable to criminal charges after the House has impeached and the Senate convicted a president. Sauer said in response to a judge’s questions that a president could kill a political opponent and get away with it if the Senate didn’t convict him.\n\nBut the three-judge appeals panel ruled unanimously that former presidents are subject to laws that Congress approves and that courts judge.\n\n\"Former President Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law and he is answerable in court for his conduct,\" the panel ruled.\n\nWhy did Trump welcome the Supreme Court taking case?\n\nTrump welcomed the decision by arguing that without immunity, a president wouldn’t be able to function in the job because he would always be fearful about prosecution over contentious actions.\n\n“Presidents will always be concerned, and even paralyzed, by the prospect of wrongful prosecution and retaliation after they leave office,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “This could actually lead to the extortion and blackmail of a President. The other side would say, ‘If you don’t do something, just the way we want it, we are going to go after you when you leave office, or perhaps even sooner.’”\n\nBut legal experts contend such an expansive view of immunity would leave presidents unaccountable. Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney, said “this isn’t a hard case” because providing a president immunity for trying to steal an election “has to be a loser.”\n\n“If not, our claim to be a democracy is no longer viable,” Vance said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMcQuade, another former prosecutor, said a Supreme Court decision in spring would still allow Chutkan to begin a trial in August or September and finish it before November.\n\n\"I think there is time for the case to be decided and then tried before the election,\" McQuade said.\n\nWhy is the Supreme Court hearing Trump's appeal now?\n\nJustice Department special counsel Jack Smith had tried to get the high court to weigh in earlier but was rebuffed.\n\nAfter the trial court judge ruled in December that the presidency doesn’t confer a lifelong “get-out-of-jail-free” pass, Smith tried to leapfrog the normal appeals process in hopes of getting a final decision so the trial could start in March.\n\nSmith told the justices that the case presents \"a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy” that only the Supreme Court can definitively resolve.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined Smith’s request without comment. There were no noted dissents.\n\nNo justices dissented Wednesday either when the court announced it will decide the immunity issue now that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has acted.\n\nThat leaves observers guessing about why they're taking the case. It takes four justices to agree to hear an appeal. A major reason for doing so is if they think the lower court’s decision was wrong. But another is if the issue is of major significance.\n\n\"While at least four justices agreed to hear the case, that doesn’t mean four are inclined to accept Trump’s immunity defense,\" said Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former U.S. attorney. \"Even Jack Smith argued that this issue is a matter of national import that should be decided by this court, even if only to reject the defense or limit its contours.\"\n\nThe decision to hear the appeal – but do so on an accelerated schedule − may also have been a compromise if some justices wanted to deny it outright and others wanted full consideration. The fact that the court took about two weeks to decide could indicate there was a lot of back-and-forth.\n\nAlan Morrison, a law professor and associate dean for public interest at George Washington University, said options for the high court’s change of mind include wanting to hear what the circuit court had to say and perhaps playing a “bait and switch” on Smith.\n\n“The fact is this is the worst outcome for him in terms of what could have happened,” Morrison said. “He’s certainly not at fault. I thought it was a bold move to try to get the court to take it.”\n\nHow quickly is the Supreme Court acting?\n\nTypically, when a case gets appealed to the Supreme Court it can take months and months for a resolution. For example, in a case the justices heard Wednesday on whether the government can ban “bump stocks” on guns, the oral arguments came nearly four months after the court agreed to take the case.\n\nIn Trump’s immunity appeal, oral arguments will happen in about half that time.\n\n“This is still a very expedited timetable for a major historic case at the Supreme Court,” Norm Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House of Representatives' first impeachment of Trump, said on CNN.\n\nStill, Smith this month had urged the court to act even sooner if they now wanted to hear the appeal. He was hoping for oral arguments in March, not April.\n\nAnd it can take months for the justices to issue an opinion after hearing a case.\n\nDelays could mean Supreme Court tells voters it's 'up to you,' expert says\n\nThe trial will be delayed, but it’s not clear for how long.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled the trial for March 4. But the dispute over immunity has halted action in the case indefinitely.\n\nThe justices agreed to hear the case the week of April 22, which means a decision could come in May or June. If the trial can proceed after the high court’s decision, there would still be about two months of preparation for trial, under Chutkan’s earlier schedule for the case.\n\nProsecutors have estimated their case could take four to six weeks, then Trump’s defense could present its arguments. The election interference trial could still happen before the November election, but the longer the Supreme Court takes to rule on immunity, the smaller the chances for a verdict before voting.\n\n“The Supreme Court’s message to us is, ‘Hey voters, we’re leaving this up to you,’” Vance added on X.\n\nTrump has other trials pending\n\nTrump has a variety of civil and criminal trials pending as he hashes out the immunity claims with the Supreme Court. He is appealing civil verdicts totaling more than $500 million from columnist E. Jean Carroll and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nAmong criminal cases, Trump’s New York trial on charges of falsifying business records is scheduled March 25 and could last a couple of months.\n\nTrump’s federal trial on charges of hoarding national defense records after leaving the White House is tentatively set for May 20. But U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon set a scheduling hearing Friday to discuss pretrial preparations and the date could change.\n\nTrump has asked Cannon to dismiss those charges based on immunity and her decision is pending. Trump contends that he designated records marked classified as personal records under the Presidential Records Act, so he was free to take them with him to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nProsecutors have disputed the records containing some of the country’s most important national security secrets were personal and said there was no documentation that they had been declassified.\n\nIn Georgia, Trump faces racketeering charges without a trial date set. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked for an Aug. 5 trial, but the judge hasn’t set a date yet. Trump is trying to disqualify Willis, with closing arguments in that dispute scheduled Friday.\n\nHow has Trump fared before the Supreme Court?\n\nTrump reshaped the Supreme Court, giving it a potent conservative supermajority that has made major policy decisions, most notably overturning the 5-decade-old decision that made abortion legal nationwide.\n\nBut when it comes to Trump’s personal issues, he hasn’t gotten a lot of love.\n\nAfter Trump lost reelection in 2020, the court threw out a Texas lawsuit aiming to overturn the results in four battleground states.\n\nThe court has also allowed New York City prosecutors and Congress to get his tax records and didn’t stop the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 from accessing presidential documents. The justices also declined Trump’s request to get involved in the dispute over classified documents seized at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022.\n\nBut when hearing Trump’s challenge to Colorado’s decision that an anti-insurrection provision of the Constitution makes the former president ineligible to serve again, even the court’s liberal justices sounded skeptical that one state could make such a determination about a national candidate. That decision is pending.\n\nAnother Trump case at the Supreme CourtSupreme Court grapples with leaving Donald Trump on presidential ballot in Colorado\n\nWhat are 'official acts' of a president?\n\nIn agreeing to hear the case, the Supreme Court appeared to focus on what sort of “official acts” should shield a president from prosecution.\n\nPart of Trump’s argument for immunity is based on one of the high court's earliest decisions, called Marbury v. Madison, which found a president’s official acts “can never be examinable by the courts.” Trump defined official acts broadly to include his campaign-related activities covered in the criminal charges.\n\nBut the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that former presidents can be tried for official acts because the prosecution by definition means the allegations were carried out in defiance of the law. In Marbury, the Supreme Court found the president is responsible for his conduct and “cannot at his discretion” violate the law.\n\n“Here, former President Trump’s actions allegedly violated generally applicable criminal laws, meaning those acts were not properly within the scope of his lawful discretion; accordingly, Marbury and its progeny provide him no structural immunity from the charges in the Indictment,” the appeals panel wrote.\n\nMorrison, the George Washington professor, said he expects the justices to focus on what actions could be considered official. For example, disputes over whether Trump should have called the National Guard to combat the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, could be considered official acts as commander in chief. But Trump’s reported effort to visit the Capitol during the riot might sound campaign related.\n\n“I think what this question is looking at is the equivalent of what happens in civil liability cases involving the president, which is to zero in on specific acts that the indictment alleges and see whether they are within the outer limits of the president’s authority,” Morrison said. “It’s going to be very tricky.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-supreme-court-abortion-case/7545711001/", "title": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade abortion decision", "text": "Roe is no more.\n\nOn Friday morning, a divided U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the right to an abortion, clearing the way for dozens of states, including Michigan, to either renew laws already on the books or propose new ones that criminalize or permit the procedure.\n\nIn reversing both Roe and the 1993 Casey decision, which reaffirmed a right to abortion but gave the states more leeway in setting restrictions, a conservative majority of the Supreme Court said those previous decisions were wrong and that it fell to legislators in the states to determine whether and when to allow abortions other than in cases where a pregnant person's life is in danger.\n\nMore:Where Michigan stands on abortion if Roe v. Wade overturned by Supreme Court\n\nMore:Michigan Court of Claims judge grants injunction against 1931 abortion law\n\nThe court voted 6-3 to uphold a Mississippi law that effectively prohibits abortions after 15 weeks, earlier than the 23 or 24 weeks at which a fetus has been considered viable or able to survive outside the womb. Abortion bans prior to viability had been ruled unconstitutional under Casey until now.\n\nMichigan abortion rights\n\nMany states may now move to restrict abortion even further. In Michigan, the question is whether a 1931 law prohibiting practically all abortions except in cases where a pregnant person's life is in danger goes into effect. At least one judge has granted a temporary injunction to stop that from happening and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has asked the state Supreme Court to declare that law out of step with the state constitution.\n\n“Today is a sad day for America as an unelected group of conservative judges act squarely against the will of the people and medical expertise,\" Whitmer said. \"However we personally feel about abortion, health — not politics — should drive important medical decisions.\"\n\n\"For now, a Michigan court has put a temporary hold on the law, but that decision is not final,\" she added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, speaking Friday afternoon from the White House, criticized the decision and the court, saying it had never before taken away a right it had previously guaranteed to Americans. He urged voters to elect abortion rights supporters to Congress this fall so it could restore the right.\n\n\"This is not over,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland also criticized the decision, calling it \"a devastating blow to reproductive freedom.\" He added, however, that the decision \"does not eliminate the ability of states to keep abortion legal within their borders\" and that states with restrictive abortion laws can't keep pregnant people from traveling elsewhere for the procedure.\n\n[ Want more updates on this developing story? Download our app for the latest ]\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, rejoiced, having fought to overturn the ruling since its inception. Former President Donald Trump, who appointed three conservative justices during his one term in office, shifting the balance on the court, praised the outcome.\n\n\"Today’s decision, which is the biggest WIN for LIFE in a generation, along with other decisions that have been announced recently, were only made possible because I delivered everything as promised,\" Trump said in an email.\n\n\"Life wins!\" said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. \"Millions of Americans are celebrating today’s ruling and a pro-life movement that has worked tirelessly for decades. For a half century unelected judges have dictated America’s abortion laws. This historic ruling rightfully returns power to the American people to enact laws that protect unborn children and support mothers everywhere.\"\n\nWhat the Supreme Court said\n\nIn the decision Friday, five members of the nine-member court agreed that the U.S. Constitution granted no right to abortion and there was no historical reason to assume the founders wanted to do so.\n\n\"Abortion presents a profound moral question,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. \"The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. The court overrules those decisions and returns that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nAlito continued, saying, \"Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s 'concept of existence' prove too much. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.\"\n\n\"What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on\n\nwhich Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed 'potential life' and what the law challenged in this case calls an 'unborn human being.' ”\n\nMore: Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion questions for millions in Michigan\n\nMore: Abortion access in Michigan after Roe v. Wade overturned: What we know\n\nVoting in favor of overturning Roe and upholding the Mississippi law besides Alito were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, the last three of whom were appointed by Trump. Chief Justice John Roberts concurred in the decision insofar as he would allow for \"pre-viability\" abortion restrictions by the states and uphold Mississippi's law.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented with the majority.\n\nMajority felt Roe was unworkable, compared it to school segregation\n\nRoberts, in his concurring opinion, said he agreed that the viability test put in place by Roe and Casey — which said states could only regulate abortions once a fetus could theoretically live outside the womb — was unworkable and should go. But he said he wouldn't go so far as to throw out Roe and its finding that a pregnant person had a right to an abortion in its entirety, arguing that a person should have a \"reasonable opportunity to choose\" to have the procedure and no more.\n\nRoberts also recognized that the decision to overrule a half-century of precedent was \"a serious jolt to the legal system\" and called for a \"markedly less unsettling decision\" that left Roe at least partially intact.\n\nAlito and the other four refused, saying Roberts still hadn't shown how giving a pregnant person a reasonable opportunity to have an abortion \"is 'deeply rooted in this nation’s history and tradition' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' \"\n\nRejecting the idea that Roe should stand because it had been in force for nearly a half-century, Alito said it was so badly reasoned it must go and compared the court's overturning of it to the court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education to reverse an earlier decision upholding segregation in schools.\n\nAlito also made clear that the majority wasn't extending its decision to other matters, such as the right of same-sex couples to marry. \"Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,\" he said.\n\nThomas, in a concurring opinion, agreed that the decision didn't go beyond abortion. But he wrote that in the future the court should reexamine its thinking behind protecting other rights not enumerated in the Constitution. He specifically mentioned cases that prohibit states from enforcing same-sex marriage bans, disallow married couples to purchase and use contraceptives and outlaw sexual intercourse between two men.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, Kavanaugh said simply the decision was about abortion, no more, \"The issue before this court ... is not the policy or morality of abortion. The issue before this court is what the Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion.\"\n\nDissent says women's autonomy threatened by ruling\n\nIn a sharply worded dissent, Breyer, writing for himself and the two other liberal members of the court, blasted the majority saying the earlier decisions understood that \"The government could not control a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It could not determine what the woman’s future would be. Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions.\"\n\n\"Today, the court discards that (earlier) balance,\" he wrote. \"It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\"\n\n\"Some states have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in one’s own home. They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist’s child or a young girl her father’s — no matter if doing so will destroy her life.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nA large crowd representing both sides of the question had gathered outside the court, where security was high and security fencing had been installed.\n\nNow, the question turns to what states will do and what protests are likely to occur, with the nation already divided along partisan lines and a fractious midterm election on the horizon this fall.\n\nIn expectation of a decision overturning Roe, which grew exponentially after a draft opinion by Alito was leaked in May, conservative states had been preparing to renew or enact stricter abortion laws, even as protesters took to the streets in cities across the nation demanding that their rights be protected. Millions of people in the U.S. have never lived under a regime where abortions are effectively banned and abortion rights activists have warned that such a change could lead to a circumstance where pregnant people are unfairly penalized, forced to have children even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nThey also argue that people who get pregnant will put themselves at risk by having unsafe abortions and see their economic, career and family choices dictated for them in part by the government, a situation others don't have to face.\n\nAbortion opponents argue getting rid of Roe will save millions of potential lives by banning the procedure, a change they see as a moral imperative. With the court's decision, protests are certain to grow and the issue will explode again into American political landscape ahead of the November midterm elections as another stark dividing line between the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: attspangler@freepress.com.

What is the ...", "text": "An old piece of anti-spy legislation is piquing interest again after former President Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury. Among the charges is violation of the Espionage Act, which deals with documents related to national defense and the unlawful retention of documents. The indictment comes as special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's handling of classified materials nears an end.\n\nAfter news of the indictment broke Trump took to social media to defend himself, sharing on his platform Truth Social \"I AM AN INNOCENT MAN.\" He is set to appear Tuesday at a federal courthouse in Miami.\n\nAfter Trump left the White House in January 2021, the national archives began a year of correspondence with the former president's team in search of missing classified materials. Federal agents eventually searched Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence and found over 300 classified documents. Some were allegedly kept in violation of the Espionage Act.\n\nWhat is the Espionage Act?\n\nThe Espionage Act of 1917, enacted just after the beginning of World War I, makes it illegal to obtain information, capture photographs or copy descriptions of any information relating to national defense, with the intent for that information to be used against the United States or for the gain of any foreign nation.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIndictment reactionDonald Trump plays the victim card while rivals mostly defend him\n\nIs the Espionage Act still in effect?\n\nMany significant chunks of the Espionage Act of 1917 remain in effect and can be used in the court of law. In its modern iteration, the act has been used to prosecute spies and leakers of classified information.\n\nIn the headlines relating to the Trump Mar-A-Lago search, the section of the Espionage Act —which is itself a statute of 18 US Code Chapter 37— is 793.The concerns enumerated in 18 USC 793 are \"gathering, transmitting or losing defense information.\"\n\nWhat was the purpose of the Espionage Act ?\n\nThe Espionage Act was passed to bolster the war effort. Enforced by President Woodrow Wilson's attorney general, the law made it illegal to share any information that could interfere with the war or stand to benefit foreign adversaries. It was meant as a safeguard against spying.\n\nAt the time those found guilty could be fined up to $10,000 and serve up to 20 years in jail, according the The History Channel.\n\nIs espionage a state crime?\n\nMost espionage crimes are investigated by the CIA or FBI, making them matters of federal jurisdiction and resultant in federal charges.\n\nClassified documents timelineThe journey of Trump’s classified documents\n\nWhat was the Sedition Act of 1918?\n\nPassed as an amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917, the Sedition Act made it prosecutable by law to make false statements that interfered with the war effort, insult or abuse the U.S. government, flag, constitution or military; and interfere with the production of war materials, according to The History Channel. It was also a crime under this act to advocate, teach or defend the former behavior.\n\nThe Sedition Act was was repealed by Congress in 1920 on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment.\n\nREAD THE SEARCH WARRANT:Read the FBI's search warrant for Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property\n\nWhat is espionage?\n\nThis is both a philosophical and legal question. In it's strict definition, espionage is the practice of spying – usually to obtain confidential intelligence either of a military or political nature.\n\nCornell Law School describes espionage as \"the crime of spying or secretly watching a person, company, government, etc. for the purpose of gathering secret information or detecting wrongdoing, and to transfer such information to another organization or state.\"\n\nWhat is an example of espionage?\n\nOne famous example is that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple convicted in a conspiracy to share atomic intelligence secrets with the Soviet Union.\n\nThey were executed at New York's Sing Sing Correctional Facility in June 1953. The couple is particularly famous for being the first citizens convicted and executed for espionage during peacetime, The History Channel reports.\n\nWho has been charged under the Espionage Act?\n\nA number of notable figures have been charged under the Espionage Act. Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder, was indicted under the law in 2019 for his role in releasing secret military and government information during the Obama presidency.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg is another prominent name to be tried under the Espionage Act. Ellsberg was set to face 115 years in prison, Vox reports, for his famous leaking of the Pentagon Papers concerning the status of the Vietnam War to The Washington Post and The New York Times.\n\nWhat was the punishment for violating the Espionage Act?\n\nWhen it was passed originally, the penalty for being convicted of espionage under the Espionage Act was a fine of $10,000 or less and imprisonment for twenty years or less. Both the fine and the prison sentence could be imposed in conjunction as well.\n\nWhat is CUI Basic?\n\nCUI stands for Controlled Unclassified Information and refers to a subset of CUI in which the authorizing law, regulation or government-wide policy does not set out specific guidelines for handling or dissemination, according to The National Archives.\n\nWhat are declassified documents?\n\nDeclassified means essentially to remove the previously prescribed \"top secret\" label.\n\nClassified documents refer to the kind of material that government agencies have deemed so sensitive to national security that access must be controlled and restricted, Jeffrey Fields, associate professor of the practice of international relations at USC, wrote in an article for The Conversation.\n\nThere's an elaborate procedure to declassify documents, Fields wrote, though the president has the power to declassify anything at any time in accordance with provisions of the Atomic Energy Act.\n\nDECLASSIFIED:Trump claims Mar-a-Lago documents were 'declassified.'

Greenberger\n\nAs the country mourns the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, his straightforward, forceful and often witty prose has been highlighted by both those who were heartened by his legal analyses and conclusions, and by those who were dismayed. As a woman’s rights advocate, I am most often in the latter category. In his full-throated opinions, Justice Scalia set forth a legal approach that led to a more narrow interpretation of constitutional and statutory protections for women.\n\nWomen's core legal rights include protection against sex discrimination through the equal protection of the law in the 14th Amendment, the constitutional right to privacy — safeguarding women’s health, reproductive rights, and other deeply personal decisions — and Congress’s authority to enact laws to advance and strengthen women’s constitutional rights, including in the workplace, education, health, and economic and personal security.\n\nJustice Scalia disagreed with the majority of the court that the 14th Amendment should be applied with heightened force to protect women against government-sponsored sex discrimination. He dissented, for example, from the court’s decisions finding that government prosecutors could not eliminate women from juries simply on the basis of their sex, and that state governments could not use taxpayer funds for public male-only, elite educational institutions that denied young women unique opportunities.\n\nHe also wrote separately in other cases that allowing universities to consider race as a factor in admissions to achieve a diverse student body was unconstitutional under any circumstances—a position of particularly harsh impact for women of color, and also with potential application to affirmative action programs designed to bring women into fields of study where they have been discouraged or excluded.\n\nAs to the constitutional right to privacy, Justice Scalia strongly objected to any such protection for legal abortion as set out in Roe v. Wade and all of its progeny, including decisions in more recent years narrowing the right. And he wrote impassioned dissents in the cases that extended privacy protections for same-sex couples—rights entwined with protections against sex discrimination and affecting millions of women.\n\nAnother important set of cases relates to the scope of Congress's power under the Constitution to pass laws designed to help women. Justice Scalia wrote opinions to support the narrowing of congressional authority under the Constitution to pass legislation to protect women against sex discrimination or otherwise enhance their economic and personal security.\n\nA prime example is the Family and Medical Leave Act which, by making male and female employees equally eligible for 12 weeks of job-protected leave to care for newborns or sick family members, was designed to counter the longstanding stereotype that only women were responsible for providing this care. Scalia wrote in dissent that the family leave portion of the law should be struck down as applied to state government employers, arguing that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority to remedy sex discrimination.\n\nHe concurred in striking down the medical leave portion of the statute as applied to state governments, to emphasize his view that the Constitution does not contain heightened protection against sex discrimination. In numerous other cases, he joined the opinions of other justices that were consistent with this approach. They included a case striking down a portion of the Violence Against Women Act and another that limited an individual’s ability to challenge state violations of a provision of the Medicaid law that is so vital to women.\n\nWhile Scalia's approach most often led him to support the narrowing of women's rights, it is important to note that there are some cases in which he voted to protect legal rights that are key to women. In one such case, for example, he supported an interpretation of Title VII, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in employment, to prohibit employer retaliation against employees who report unlawful sexual harassment.\n\nWhatever your views of Justice Scalia’s tenure, there is no doubt that the legal issues he addressed and voted on during his almost 30 years of service on the Supreme Court have had an enormous impact on the lives and futures of American women. His legacy underscores the importance of each justice and the need for the country to have a fully functioning Supreme Court composed of nine justices, without undue delay or obstruction.\n\nMarcia D.

Now he's back in a city ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChinese flags flutter above streets and red celebratory banners line the harbor front, as a beaming crowd of masked officials and school children wave and chant in unison inside Hong Kong’s high-speed rail terminus, welcoming the arrival of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nIn his first trip outside mainland China since the start of the pandemic, Xi arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to mark the 25th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on July 1 – a highly symbolic event at a pivotal time for both the city, and Xi himself.\n\nThe former British colony is midway through the 50-year promise of “a high degree of autonomy,” given by Beijing under a framework known as “one country, two systems.” It is also swearing in its newly appointed leader, hardline former police officer John Lee.\n\nXi, meanwhile, is only months away from finishing his first decade in power – and is widely expected to seek an unprecedented third term at a key meeting of the ruling Communist Party this fall.\n\nThe two-day trip is a timely declaration of political victory for Xi, who has brought Hong Kong to heel with a sweeping national security law following the 2019 anti-government protests. In just two years, critics say, the law has been used to crush the city’s opposition movement, overhaul its electoral system, silence its outspoken media and cripple its once-vibrant civil society.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied the national security law is suppressing freedoms. Instead, it insists the law has ended chaos and restored stability to the city.\n\nPeople wave Chinese and Hong Kong flags as fishing boats carrying banners celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China sail through the Victoria Harbour. Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor an authoritarian leader obsessed with stability, Hong Kong may now feel more like home than ever. Unlike his previous visits to the city, Xi no longer needs to worry about any public expression of dissent – be it critical headlines on local newspaper front pages, protest slogans on billboards or mass rallies in the streets.\n\nInstead, he is set to be surrounded by only “patriotic” officials, loyal tycoons and a blanket of heavy security measures – including extensive roadblocks and a citywide ban on drones. He will be separated from the public by a meticulously maintained “closed loop” system – put in place to protect him against the city’s rising Covid-19 infections.\n\nIn a sign of the heightened security, journalists from at least seven media organizations, including CNN, were blocked from covering the ceremony days before the event, after initially receiving accreditation.\n\nBeijing’s supporters say Hong Kong has ushered in a “new era of stability, prosperity and opportunity.”\n\n“This is an important milestone for our nation and Hong Kong,” the city’s government said in a statement marking the anniversary. “(It) not only captures Hong Kong’s impressive achievements over the past two and a half decades, it also underscores our eager anticipation for and confidence in a brighter future.”\n\nBut critics fear Hong Kong is being increasingly reshaped in China’s image. To some, the “one country, two systems” experiment is already dead – 25 years ahead of schedule.\n\nIn 2019, a proposed bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China from Hong Kong plunged the city into months of social unrest. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\n“One country, two systems”\n\nProposed by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, “one country, two systems” is a political formula originally intended to help China achieve unification with Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy with a capitalist economy. But it ended up being first applied to Hong Kong, with the hope that it would set a desirable example for Taiwan to follow later.\n\nThe governance model allows a capitalist bubble to coexist within a socialist country, with a pledge that Hong Kong’s capitalist system and way-of-life will remain unchanged for 50 years.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher visited Beijing in 1984 to sign the Sino-British Joint Declaration for the handover of Hong Kong, Deng assured the British Prime Minister that “China will always keep its promises.”\n\n“When we gave the figure of 50 years, we were not speaking casually or on impulse, but in consideration of the realities in China and of our need for development,” he told Thatcher.\n\nUpon his arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, Xi called the “one country, two systems” a “good system.”\n\n“Facts have proved that ‘one country, two systems’ has strong vitality. It can ensure Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability, and safeguard the well-being of Hong Kong compatriots,” Xi said inside the West Kowloon Station.\n\n“Over the past few years, Hong Kong has withstood one severe test after another and overcome one risk and challenge after another. After weathering the storms, Hong Kong has emerged from the ashes with vigorous vitality,” he said.\n\nBut critics, including Hong Kong’s last British governor Chris Patten, have accused Beijing of breaching those promises in recent years as it tightened its grip on Hong Kong.\n\n“It’s fair to say for 10 years after 1997, maybe a bit longer, things did not go too badly wrong, but they’ve gone downhill since, partly because Xi Jinping and his colleagues are terrified of what Hong Kong actually stands for,” Patten said at a press conference last week.\n\nFight for democracy\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has waged an ideological war against the influence of “Western values” such as constitutional democracy, press freedom, judicial independence and universal human rights – notions that have long been cherished in Hong Kong and formed an integral part of its identity.\n\nThe city’s pursuit of full democracy, namely ultimately electing its leader by universal suffrage – a goal written into its mini-constitution, the Basic Law – is especially viewed with suspicion by Beijing, which is worried that a freely elected leader could pose a challenge to its authority.\n\nAs Beijing dragged its feet on electoral reforms, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy advocates lost patience. In 2014, thousands of young protesters occupied key roads in the city’s financial center to demand “true universal suffrage” – rejecting a proposal by China’s parliament to have the candidates vetted in advance by a pro-Beijing committee. The peaceful protests, known as the “Umbrella Movement,” ended after 79 days, with none of their demands met.\n\nSince then, Beijing has sought to exert more control over Hong Kong. During his first visit to the city as China’s leader in 2017, Xi warned that any efforts to “challenge the power” of the central government were “absolutely impermissible.”\n\n“Any attempt to endanger China’s sovereignty and security…or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line,” he said in a speech on Hong Kong’s 20th handover anniversary.\n\nBut Beijing’s tightening grip only intensified discontent in the city, especially among its younger generation – many of whom fear they are running out of time to fight for democracy before the 2047 deadline.\n\nSome tried to push for change by joining the city’s legislature, but that failed too under increasing pressure from Beijing. A slew of pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified over an oath-taking controversy, while other candidates were barred from standing for office.\n\nLong-running tensions eventually erupted in 2019. Over that summer, peaceful marches against a proposed bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China soon snowballed into sometimes violent anti-Beijing protests, plunging the city into months of social unrest and its most tumultuous period since the handover.\n\nA year later, during a lull in the protests brought by the pandemic, Beijing bypassed the city’s legislature to impose a national security law, which took effect the day before the July 1 handover anniversary. In vaguely defined terms, the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces – and allows for maximum sentences of life imprisonment.\n\nA riot policeman sprays pepper spray at a man as they disperse a crowd during a demonstration against \"parallel traders\" who buy goods in Hong Kong to resell in mainland China on Sunday, January 5.

Dale De La Rey/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: Hong Kong unrest Prev Next\n\nHong Kong’s transformation\n\nSince then, crackdown measures that would have been previously unthinkable have arrived at a dizzying speed, drastically transforming Hong Kong’s political and social landscape.\n\nNearly all of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures, including activists and politicians, have either been jailed or forced into exile. No opposition lawmakers are left in the legislature, which now allows only “patriots” to run for office.\n\nThe city’s most outspoken newspaper, Apple Daily, has been shuttered, followed by a number of smaller pro-democracy outlets, while dozens of civil society groups, from unions and churches to activist groups, have disbanded. Memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, from statues to annual commemoration vigils, are being erased from public spaces.\n\nTens of thousands of citizens are voting with their feet, emigrating to democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\n\nResponding to CNN’s request for comment on the city’s diminishing freedoms, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said: “Many freedoms and rights are not absolute, and can be restricted for reasons including protection of national security and public safety.”\n\nBut Xi’s transformation of Hong Kong is not only about chipping away the freedoms it once had – it also seeks to reshape the city in China’s image and connect it more deeply with the motherland.\n\nStarting from this year, schools, including some kindergartens, are required to hold a ceremony to raise the national flag at least once a week, where the national anthem must be played and sung.\n\nIn classrooms, national security education has been introduced to the curriculum to “develop in students a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity,” while books by pro-democracy figures, or others that are deemed politically sensitive, have been removed from the shelves of public libraries.\n\nHong Kong police are now adopting the goose-stepping marching style of the Chinese army, abandoning the British style they have used since the colonial area.\n\nHong Kong police officers perform a new goose-stepping march, the same style used by the Chinese military, to mark the National Security Education Day in Hong Kong on April 15, 2021. ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDays ahead of the 25th handover ceremony, the Wong Tai Sin temple, a Taoist shrine popular with local worshipers, became the first religious premise to hold a flag-raising ceremony in Hong Kong, after building a permanent platform for the Chinese and Hong Kong flags. Under Xi, Chinese flags have become ubiquitous at temples, churches and mosques across mainland China.\n\nHong Kong officials speak proudly of efforts to embed Hong Kong deeper into China’s national economic master plans, including developing the Greater Bay Area – a region Beijing hopes will one day rival the bay areas of San Francisco, New York and Tokyo.\n\nIn 2018, Xi officiated the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the longest sea-crossing bridge ever built. The same year, the West Kowloon Station opened, connecting Hong Kong with the mainland by high-speed rail.\n\nSince the pandemic, however, both projects have lain mostly idle, due to strict border controls between Hong Kong and mainland China – the last places in the world still adhering to a stringent zero-Covid strategy.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Xi is expected to cross that border at least three times in his two-day trip, as he plans to spend the night in Shenzhen – without being subject to centralized quarantine like ordinary travelers.\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in Hong Kong, thousands of officials, guests and staff have begun quarantining in the city’s hotels since Wednesday, merely to attend the ceremony.\n\nXi’s visit may be historic on many fronts, but for many Hong Kongers, his presence will only confirm how much has changed in so little time.", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}]}

Nearly 70% of the fruits and veggies on the list had no detectable pesticide residues, while just under 5% had residues of two or more pesticides, the report said.\n\nAvocados had the lowest levels of pesticides among the 46 foods tested, followed by sweet corn, pineapple, onions and papaya.\n\nMultiple pesticides\n\nIssued yearly since 2004, the EWG report uses US Department of Agriculture test data to rank 46 foods that are the most and least contaminated with pesticide residues. The USDA staffers prepare the food as consumers would – washing, peeling or scrubbing – before testing each item.\n\nThe USDA does not sample all 46 foods each year, so EWG pulls results from the most recent testing period. Strawberries, for example, have not been tested by the USDA since 2016, Temkin said,\n\nMany samples of the 46 fruits and vegetables included in the report tested positive for multiple pesticides, including insecticides and fungicides. Over 90% of “strawberries, apples, cherries, spinach, nectarines and grapes tested positive for residues of two or more pesticides,” the report said.\n\nTesting found the highest level of multiple pesticides – 103 – on samples of the heart-healthy trio of kale, collards and mustard greens, followed by 101 different pesticides on hot and bell peppers. In general, “spinach samples had 1.8 times as much pesticide residue by weight as any other crop tested,” the report said.\n\nBeing exposed to multiple pesticides, even at low levels, is “supra-additive,” with each pesticide having more of a health impact than it might in isolation, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, chief of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone, who was not involved in the report.\n\nHealth risks of pesticides\n\nHealth dangers from pesticides depend on the type, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Pesticides can impact the nervous system, irritate the eyes and skin, interfere with the hormonal systems of the body, or cause cancer, the EPA said.\n\nThe pesticide DCPA, classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen and banned in 2009 by the European Union, was frequently detected on collards, mustard greens and kale, the EWG report said.\n\nChlorpyrifos, a pesticide often used on nut and fruit trees and row crops such as broccoli and cauliflower, was banned by the EPA in February 2022 after a 15-year effort by environmental groups.\n\nChlorpyrifos contains an enzyme “which leads to neurotoxicity, and has also been associated with potential neurodevelopmental effects in children,” the EPA said.\n\nBabies and children are especially vulnerable to pesticides, experts say, because of the damage the chemicals can cause to the developing brain. A 2020 study found an increase in IQ loss and intellectual disability in children due to exposure to organophosphates, a common class of pesticides.\n\nA large number of pesticides also affect the endocrine system in developing fetuses, which can interfere with developmental growth, reproduction and metabolism.\n\n“Even a brief exposure to pesticides which alter endocrine function can cause permanent effects if the exposure occurs during critical windows of reproductive development,” according to the EPA.\n\nIndustry complaints\n\nThe agricultural industry has long complained about the release of the “Dirty Dozen,” saying EWG “willfully” misrepresents USDA data in the report.\n\n“To put it simply, EWG’s attempt to twist the data to create bias … results in growing consumer fear of fruits and vegetables,” said Chris Novak, president and CEO of CropLife America, a national trade association that represents the manufacturers, formulators and distributors of pesticides.\n\n“A study found that specifically naming the “Dirty Dozen” resulted in shoppers being less likely to buy ANY vegetables and fruit, not just those named on their list,” Novak said via email.\n\nIn response, EWG said the study in question, which was funded by another industry association, the Alliance for Food and Farming, presents an entirely different reality than what Novak describes.\n\n“The study actually shows that just over half of people surveyed said the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list made them more likely to buy fruits and vegetables,” Temkin said. “Only about 1 in 6 said our report would make them less likely to buy produce.”\n\nSteps consumers can take\n\nBesides eating organic, there are a number of actions consumers can take to reduce exposure to pesticides – and many other toxins such as heavy metals – that can be found in produce.\n\nRinse all produce before serving. Don’t use soap, detergent or commercial produce wash – water is the best choice, experts say.\n\n“Soap and household detergents can be absorbed by fruits and vegetables, despite thorough rinsing, and can make you sick. Also, the safety of the residues of commercial produce washes is not known and their effectiveness has not been tested,” the US Food and Drug Administration stated.\n\nChoose local. Buying food that is purchased directly from a local farmer can reduce the risk of pesticide exposure, experts say.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBuy in season.

Experts say the best way to wash produce is by washing it with just cold water. Pesticide residue was still found on over 70% of the non-organic produce tested. Nearly all of the levels fell under the legal limits allowed by government regulations, Environmental Working Group said.\n\nTeresa Thorne, executive director of the Alliance for Food and Farming, a nonprofit that represents organic and conventional farmers, says Environmental Working Group's lists concern her.\n\nFirst, she said, peer-reviewed research has shown that it's scientifically unsupportable, especially the claim that eating organic foods versus conventionally grown foods will result in lower pesticide exposure.\n\n\"Residues on conventional-grown are already so minute if they're present at all,\" she said. \"The second thing is is that this list has been shown again through peer-reviewed research to negatively impact consumers. When low-income consumers were exposed to this list and some of the messaging in the Dirty Dozen list, they stated they were less likely to purchase any produce, organic or conventional.\"\n\nShe said Environmental Working Group's goal to help families access fruits and vegetables with less pesticide exposure was achieved long ago.\n\nAccording to Thorne, 99.8% of the fruits and vegetables tested by the USDA under the Pesticide Data Program are well below the Environmental Protection Agency's safety levels.

It's the second straight year strawberries have led the list, which has been published since 2004 and is based on U.S. Department of Agriculture tests of 48 types of produce.\n\nEWG, a non-profit research group, found 70% of the thousands of analyzed samples contained at least some pesticides. Altogether, the group found 178 different types of pesticides.\n\nIs washing your produce a waste of time?\n\n\"Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is essential no matter how they're grown,\" said EWG senior analyst Sonya Lunder, \"but for the items with the heaviest pesticide loads, we urge shoppers to buy organic.\"\n\nJust about all the samples of strawberries, spinach, peaches, nectarines, cherries and apples contained pesticide residue, the analysis found. The most contaminated of the strawberries had 20 different pesticide types.\n\n\"A crop like strawberries will always have lots of pesticide residues because they are vulnerable to pests, they grow directly in the soil, have a high water content and lack a protective outer peel,\" Lunder said.\n\nCheddar, feta, mozzarella: The most nutritious cheeses you can eat\n\nSpinach made one of the more notable jumps on this year's list, moving from No. 8 to No. 2. Lunder said the USDA \"found significantly more pesticides by weight than prior years,\" with the average pesticide weight on spinach doubling that of other produce.\n\nSweet corn and avocados topped the EWG's Clean Fifteen list of foods with the least amount of pesticides. The study found these foods contained few pesticides and pesticide residue.\n\nThe organic produce market has exploded since the 1990s. A market analysis by the Organic Trade Organization found organic food sales increased from $3.6 billion in 1997 to $43.3 billion in 2015, with no signs of slowing down. Millenials, the study said, have stoked organic growth along with more consumer interest in where food comes from.\n\nGot milk? This is the kind you should be drinking\n\n\"From the surge in sales of organic food year after year,\" Lunder said, \"it's clear that consumers would rather eat fruits and vegetables grown without synthetic pesticides.\"\n\nA recent USA TODAY analysis on washing produce, showed regulations, and the level of pesticides on produce, make it unlikely a person would get sick from eating raw produce. Although it's not impossible.\n\nThe Alliance for Food and Farming, which represents organic and non-organic growers, is opposed to the EWG's list. The alliance's Executive Director Teresa Thorne said the list has been \"discredited\" and dissuades people from eating fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"If EWG truly cares about public health,\" Thorne said, \"it will stop referring to popular produce items that kids love as 'dirty' and move toward positive, science based information that reassures consumers and promotes consumption.\"\n\nHowever, the EWG said parents, in particular, should avoid feeding their young children food with pesticides, which have been linked to lower IQs.\n\n\"Even low levels of pesticide exposure can be harmful to infants, babies and young children, so when possible, parents and caregivers should take steps to lower children's exposures to pesticides while still feeding them diets rich in healthy fruits and vegetables,\" said Dr. Phillip Landrigan of the Mt.

An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors, HBBF, which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States – including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are among the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also pored over data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared at home. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourth of the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion, according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used in homemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregivers can help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and instead choosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human body doesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregivers need to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/03/22/dirty-dozen-fruits-vegetables-pesticides/4772652001/", "title": "Dirty Dozen 2021: Top 12 most contaminated fruits, vegetables", "text": "Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has released an annual list of fruits and vegetables the group calls the Dirty Dozen, because they're deemed to contain the most pesticides. But there are a few surprises to this year's list.\n\nWhile kale has been alone in the No. 3 spot since 2019 — the first time it made the list in 10 years — the group added mustard greens and collard greens alongside it. All three are known to be low in calories, high in fiber and have antioxidant qualities. Strawberries are No. 1 and spinach comes in at No. 2 on the list.\n\nMore:Worried about your fruits and vegetables?

The group identified, according to a news release, which fresh fruits and vegetables contain the most and the least amount of pesticide residue. You can find the list at www.ewg.org.\n\nAmong the findings, the EWG cited included:\n\n70% of nonorganic fresh produce sold in the U.S. had pesticides.\n\n20 different pesticides were found in a single sample of the three leafy greens in the No. 3 spot.\n\n115 pesticides — the highest amount — were found on bell peppers.\n\n“Whether organic or conventionally grown, fruits and vegetables are critical components of a healthy diet,” said EWG toxicologist Thomas Galligan in a news release. “We urge consumers who are concerned about their pesticide intake to consider, when possible, purchasing organically grown versions of the foods on EWG’s Dirty Dozen, or conventional produce from our Clean Fifteen.”\n\nEat your veggies\n\nThe annual report is not without controversy.\n\nWhat’s important to note is that dietitians and health experts recommend that the overall goal is for Americans to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables for a healthy, well-balanced diet.\n\nThe Alliance for Food and Farming (AFF), strong opponents of EWG's annual list, says it shows a negative impact on fruit and vegetable consumption.\n\n“Last year, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) faced significant criticism from the nutrition community for inaccurately escalating and perpetuating consumer safety fears about these healthy foods as our world was locking down due to the pandemic,” Teresa Thorne, Executive Director of the AFF said in a news release. “EWG continues to dismiss the needs of consumers and disrespect farmers by choosing to inaccurately disparage the very foods health experts agree we should eat more of every day to improve immune function, prevent diseases and increase lifespan.”\n\nThey also point out that the USDA's Pesticide Data Program report finds that 99% of samples tested fell below the safety standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, more than 40% of produce tested had no detectable pesticide residue.\n\nOnly one in 10 Americans eat enough fruits and vegetables daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends that adults eat 1½-2 cups of fruit and 2-3 cups of vegetables per day.\n\nThe AFF also points to studies that found eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, may reduce the risk for certain diseases. Another Tufts University study found that prescribing fruits and vegetables would prevent nearly 2 million cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, 350,000 deaths and cut health care costs by $40 billion.\n\nThe AFF finds that the EWG's Dirty Dozen list creates fear and disparages consumers from buying — organic or not.\n\n“With only one in 10 Americans eating enough fruits and vegetables each day, we should be promoting consumption to enhance immune function and prevent illness, not discouraging it with tactics like the Dirty Dozen list,” Thorne added.\n\nAlexis Temkin, Ph.D., EWG toxicologist, says the group advises that eating a diet that is high in fruit and vegetables, organic or conventional and including frozen and canned, should be a priority.\n\n\"There is increasing evidence that low dose chronic exposure to mixture of pesticides may have adverse effects on human health, particularly during sensitive windows of development like pregnancy and childhood,\" Temkin said in an email to the Free Press.\n\nEWG said it is aware that access and being able to afford organic is not always an option. That is why, they said, the group created its \"Clean 15\" shoppers guide.\n\nWhile the EWG's list is based on USDA data, most pesticide residues detected fall within established government levels.\n\nAlong with the Dirty Dozen list, EWG releases its list of fruits and vegetables that contain the least amount of pesticides. At the top of that list is the beloved avocado. Also, on the list are asparagus, cabbage, and cauliflower — all known as nutritional all-stars.\n\nTo help consumers the AFF provides an easy-to-use risk at safefruitsandveggies.com showing how many servings of a specific fruit or vegetable one would have to eat without any effect on the highest amount of pesticide residue the USDA recorded.\n\nWith bell peppers that would be 196 servings for a woman in one day.\n\nTo handle fruits and vegetables safely, the FDA recommends washing them before eating or using.\n\nEWG's list of most contaminated fruits and vegetables\n\nStrawberries Spinach Kale, collard and mustard greens Nectarines Apples Grapes Cherries Peaches Pears Bell and hot peppers Celery Tomatoes\n\nEWG's Clean 15\n\nAvocados Sweet corn* Pineapple Onions Papaya* Sweet peas (frozen) Eggplant Asparagus Broccoli Cabbage Kiwi Cauliflower Mushrooms Honeydew melon Cantaloupe\n\nContact Detroit Free Press food writer Susan Selasky and send food and restaurant news to: 313-222-6872 or sselasky@freepress.com.

According to a brief published alongside the study by the advocacy organization Environmental Working Group (EWG), the findings \"ring alarm bells,\" as the chemical is thought to be harmful and was found in common oat and wheat-based products, including Cheerios and Quaker Oats.\n\nHere's what to know about the findings.\n\nWhat is chlormequat?\n\nChlormequat chloride is a pesticide used as a plant growth regulator. The agricultural chemical works by decreasing stem height. This prevents crops from bending over, which can make harvesting more difficult. It is most commonly used on wheat, oats and barley, per the EWG.\n\nChlormequat is not approved for use on edible plants in the U.S. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided in 2018 to allow the importation of foods treated with the chemical. It is approved for use on food crops, mostly grains, in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nWhat did the study say?\n\nListeria outbreak:Salad kit from Bristol Farms now included in listeria-related recalls as outbreak grows\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, found that chlormequat was detected in 77 of 96, or 80%, of Americans tested for chlormequat.\n\nResearchers used urine samples collected from three geographical regions between 2017 and 2023 to test for the presence and concentration of chlormequat in the bodies of the participants. The study found not only that 4 out of 5 Americans have the pesticide in their system, but that the concentration has increased compared to prior years.\n\nThe study also found the chemical in 92% of oat-based foods purchased and tested in May 2023, including Quaker Oats and Cheerios.\n\nWhat products were found to contain chlormequat?\n\nResearchers found the presence of chlormequat in both traditional and organic oat and wheat-based foods.\n\nResearchers tested conventional oat-based products purchased in June and August 2022 and May 2023. Of both sets, chlormequat was detected in 92% of the tested products. Organic oat-based products had a lower detection rate of 12.5%.\n\nA sample of conventional wheat-based products tested in February 2023 also found that 22% had traces of chlormequat.\n\nThe study authors tested several individual items from a variety of brands for the presence of chlormequat. The chemical was found in several General Mills products, including Cheerios; Quakers Food products including oatmeal, granola bars and Old Fashioned Oats; and some generic store-brand granola and cereals, including Walmart and Target.\n\nMollie Wulff, a spokesperson for General Mills, told USA TODAY in a statement: \"All our products adhere to all regulatory requirements. Food safety is always our top priority at General Mills, and we take care to ensure our food is prepared and packaged in the safest way possible.\"\n\nPepsiCo, which owns Quaker Foods, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nWhat are the effects of chlormequat?\n\nScientists don't know the exact impact of chlormequat on the human body, as testing has been focused on animals thus far.\n\nSome prior studies have found that chlormequat is linked to infertility, disrupted fetal growth, delayed puberty and disruptions to the metabolic system. However, these studies were performed on mice and rats and have not been conducted on or translated to humans.\n\nEWG said that studies on the pesticide are ongoing but argued, \"Although these studies focus only on the chemical’s potential effects on animals, they raise questions about whether it could also harm humans. \"\n\nThe EWG also noted a 2023 proposal by the EPA to allow the use of chlormequat on barley, oat, triticale and wheat grown in the U.S. for the first time following chlormequat manufacturer Taminco's application to do so in 2019. EWG has said they oppose the plan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/10/dirty-dozen-list-fruits-vegetables-most-pesticides/502096002/", "title": "Strawberries, spinach top 'Dirty Dozen' list of food with most pesticides", "text": "If you're wary of the promises of organic produce, maybe you should at the very least start eating organic strawberries, recent research suggests.\n\nFor the third straight year, strawberries top the Environmental Working Group's Dirty Dozen list of fruits and vegetables with the most pesticide residues. But others view the report with skepticism.\n\nAbout a third of all strawberry samples had at least 10 pesticides, the study found. One sample, had an \"astounding\" 22 pesticide residues, notes the EWG, a non-profit group advocating for better human and environmental health.\n\nFollowing strawberries on the Dirty Dozen list was spinach, in which 97% of samples contained pesticides residues.

More than 80% of the time, these fruits and vegetables contained no pesticides, which can cause adverse health effects related to pregnancy complications and children with low IQs.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says today's fruits and vegetables are \"safer than ever.\" The Alliance for Food and Farming, which represents organic and non-organic growers, said the Dirty Dozen list is \"unsupportable.\" It points to USDA and U.S. Food and Drug Administration data which shows 99% of residues are \"well below safety levels\" set by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe alliance's executive director Teresa Thorne said the list may deter low-income consumers from buying fruits and vegetables and \"may be harming public health efforts to improve the diets of Americans.\"\n\nCheese:Cheddar, feta, mozzarella: The most nutritious cheeses you can eat\n\nMilk:Got milk?

It's nature's candy.\"\n\nAnd, of course, \"An apple a day helps keep the doctor away.\"\n\nWe've all heard the slogans and sayings and we know the bottom line: Fruits and vegetable are good for you.\n\nThat said, are all fruits and vegetables equally good for you? A study by the Environemtal Working Group suggests that might not be the case.\n\nThe group this week released its 2018 Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce, and an accompanying list of the \"Dirty Dozen\" fruits and vegetables with the highest quantities of pesticide levels, as wells as its \"Clean Fifteen\" list of those items on which few, if any, pesticide residues were detected.\n\nAt the top of the \"Dirty Dozen\" list are strawberries, spinach and nectarines. And several items commonly grown in Indiana — including tomatoes, apples and potatoes — also find themselves on the report's \"Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nCoal on the rebound: Could this 'clean coal’ plant proposal be answer to Indiana’s 17 billion tons of reserves?\n\nPothole got you down: You can file a pothole damage claim with Indianapolis, but it probably will be denied\n\nThe nonprofit still encourages individuals to eat fruits and vegetables and more of them for their known health benefits, but says it wants to help shoppers choose healthy produce while minimizing their exposure to pesticides.\n\nHence, the group's \"Clean Fifteen,\" which includes two items frequently grown by Hoosier farmers: sweet corn and cantaloupe. Avocados, pineapple and broccoli also made that list.\n\nThe group's analysis draws on nearly 39,000 USDA tests of 47 fruits and vegetables. Among its findings, according to the report, are that nearly 70 percent of \"conventionally grown produce\" has pesticides and almost all — 98 percent — of strawberries, peaches, nectarines, cherries and apples contained at least one pesticide.\n\nStill, some are skeptical about the conclusions of the report.\n\nFred Whitford, a professor within Purdue University's agriculture program, said these results need to be put into context. He acknowledges that there are pesticides on many produce, but said it is not above the federally defined safety levels for the chemicals.\n\n\"Any time you take a simple approach and say you have residues on these foods, it draws attention to it,\" said the expert within the Purdue Extension's Pesticides Program. \"But for many, it will then put a level of fear into them and then people could make a choice not to eat fruits and vegetables.\"\n\n\"People should be educated,\" he added, \"not scared.\"\n\nThe pesticide products, whether synthetic or organic, are very expensive, according to Whitford, and so farmers try to avoid using them if possible and to grow their crops in as \"undisturbed\" of an environment as possible. Instead, his program works with farmers to research and use other tools to reduce and balance pressures from bugs, weeds and disease.\n\nThis includes picking a variety of produce that would face less disease, for example, or planting at a time that would beat the bugs.\n\n\"There are many techniques we can use, but in spite of that, mother nature has a way of hitting us hard,\" Whiteford told IndyStar. \"So then that's when we use these products because have no other choices or we could lose crop.\"\n\nFarmers in Indiana and around the country are working to bring the best and most wholesome produce to consumers' tables, especially as farmers' market season gets underway. Everyone should make sure to wash their produce — for dirt and bacteria as much as pesticides, Whitford said — and then take care of and store it properly to keep eating fruits and vegetables as safe as possible.\n\nHere are the lists in full:\n\nThe Dirty Dozen:\n\n1.

Those targeted include the Defense Minister Rosa Adelina Barahona De Rivas and Military Chief of Staff Bayardo Ramon Rodriguez Ruiz.\n\nSeparately, the US Department of State announced it was taking steps to impose visa restrictions on 116 individuals, including mayors, prosecutors, university administrators, as well as police, prison, and military officials.\n\n“The Ortega-Murillo regime continues its subjugation of democracy through effectuating sham elections, silencing peaceful opposition, and holding hundreds of people as political prisoners,” Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement.\n\n“The United States and our partners are sending a clear message to President Ortega, Vice President Murillo, and their inner circle that we continue to stand with the Nicaraguan people in their calls for the immediate release of these political prisoners and a return to democracy,” Nelson said.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Council added seven more people, including members of Ortega’s family, to its own list of sanctioned Nicaraguan officials.\n\n“Those targeted are responsible for serious human rights violations, including repression of civil society, supporting the fraudulent presidential and parliamentary elections and undermining democracy and the rule of law,” the European Council said in a statement announcing the sanctions – which now target total of 21 individuals.\n\nThe EU has also added three entities – the National Police of Nicaragua, the Supreme Electoral Council and the company overseeing telecommunications and postal services – to the list.\n\nOrtega claimed a landslide victory in November election after a months-long government crackdown on his potential political rivals. One by one, the Ortega regime locked away any credible opposition, paving the way for the elections.\n\nAt least half a dozen likely presidential contenders had been detained ahead of the vote, clearing Ortega’s path to another five years in office. Though five other presidential candidates were listed on the final ballot, none were seen as strong challengers.\n\nOrtega came to power as part of the Sandinista rebels who overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979, and fought against the US-backed Contras during the 1980s. First elected in 1985, he has since demolished Nicaragua’s presidential term limits, allowing him to run over and over again.\n\nIncreasingly, however, Ortega has retreated from the public eye, with weeks and even months passing between appearances. His wife, Rosario Murillo, is now the recognized face and voice of the administration, with an idiosyncratic daily radio broadcast.\n\nOver the years, the pair have inexorably consolidated power, appointing loyalists to top government roles and exerting an increasingly tight grip on the country’s social and political spheres.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Vasco Cotovio Hamdi Alkhshali", "Ivana Kottasová", "Vasco Cotovio", "Hamdi Alkhshali"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-profile-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "How Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky went from an actor playing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky approached a lectern under bright lights, preparing to deliver a message to the Ukrainian people.\n\n“Today I will start with long-awaited words, which I wish to announce with pride,” he said.\n\n“Finally,” he continued. “Ukraine is United … This is our victory.”\n\nThe speech was fiction. It is from the closing scene of “Servant of the People,” a satirical TV show about a down-on-his-luck high-school teacher, played by Zelensky, who is thrust into the Ukrainian presidency after his rant about corruption goes viral.\n\nThe series didn’t just make Zelensky a star. It eventually served as the springboard for his real-life presidential campaign. In April 2019, within a month of the show’s finale, the comedian-turned politician was elected Ukraine’s president.\n\nZelensky again found himself in front of a lectern Friday, but the picture he outlined in the show’s final moments has never felt further away after Russian forces invaded Ukraine Thursday.\n\nThe battle for the capital, Kyiv, continued to rage Friday. Explosions lit up the sky as the Kremlin targeted the city with missile strikes before dawn, forcing people into air raid shelters.\n\nIn his Friday morning televised address, Zelensky was again a man in character, this time playing David to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Goliath. In a dark green tee shirt with dark circles under his eyes, the Ukrainian president struck a defiant tone and praised the country’s armed forces for “brilliantly defending the country.”\n\n“Now is an important moment,” Zelensky said. “The fate of our country is being decided.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv on Friday. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nZelensky has also been active on social media, using his Twitter account to post updates and reassure Ukrainians that he is staying in the country to lead the resistance.\n\nIn a video posted on Saturday morning titled “do not believe the fakes,” Zelensky revealed that he is still in Kyiv.\n\n“I am here. We are not putting down arms. We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this,” he said.\n\n“That is it. That’s all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine,” he added.\n\nZelensky has also turned down a US offer of evacuation from Kyiv, the Ukraine embassy in Britain said Saturday on Twitter.\n\n“The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy.\n\n“Ukrainians are proud of their President,” the tweet adds.\n\n‘This gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis’\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began early Thursday. Moscow’s forces attacked by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions – and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for Ukraine and its capital.\n\nPutin framed the “military operation” as a necessary action after the United States and its allies crossed Russia’s “red lines” by expanding NATO eastward.\n\nZelensky on Friday again called for Putin to hold direct talks.\n\n“There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said in Russian.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia was ready to take part in talks in Minsk, according to reporting by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. An adviser to Zelensky told CNN that Kyiv is considering the proposal.\n\nUkraine’s democratically elected government remains intact, but Putin has made it clear this week that he does not see Ukraine as a legitimate sovereign state. On Friday he called on Ukrainians to overthrow Zelensky themselves.\n\n“Take power into your own hands,” Putin said. “It looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement (with you) than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”\n\nPutin and his government have repeatedly put forward baseless and inaccurate claims that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “fascist” or “Nazi” regime. Zelensky is Jewish and had family members die in the Holocaust.\n\nPutin’s comments are unlikely to spur any sort of Ukrainian uprising. Many of Kyiv’s residents have left the city, and those that remain are unlikely to support him, considering Ukraine’s last pro-Russian leader was ousted in a popular uprising in 2014.\n\nZelensky was elected five years later, thrashing incumbent Petro Poroshenko, but his tenure has been rocky. The first several months of his term were engulfed by the quid-pro-quo scandal which saw former US President Donald Trump’s attempt to exert pressure on Ukraine to dig up dirt on election opponent and now-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nCovid-19 then tore through the country. Zelensky’s campaign promises, such as ending the war in eastern Ukraine and stamping out corruption, remain unfilled.\n\nBut the danger Zelensky faces is no longer just political.\n\nUS officials warned lawmakers that Russian forces who entered Ukraine through Belarus were about 20 miles away from Kyiv, sources told CNN.\n\nAnd intelligence officials in Washington are concerned the city could fall under Russian control within days. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Zelensky remains a “prime target for Russian aggression,” while Zelensky himself said Russia had marked him as their “number one target.”\n\n“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957937/what-does-queens-funeral-guest-list-mean-for-diplomatic-relations", "title": "What does the Queen's funeral guest list mean for diplomatic ...", "text": "Planning for Monday’s state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II has ramped up in recent days with invitations being sent across the globe.\n\nIn what The Independent said will be “one of the largest diplomatic gatherings in decades, nearly 500 foreign dignitaries” are due to attend the event, with only three countries not receiving an invitation.

They have a huge record of human rights abuses, including what we believe to be genocide, smashing churches and persecuting Christians?”\n\nWhile it is not thought that Xi will attend the funeral, coming as it does soon after his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Uzbekistan, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry said yesterday that Beijing was “actively considering” sending a high-level delegation to the funeral.\n\nQuestions have also been raised this week about the potential involvement of former US president Donald Trump, who issued what Insider described as “an effusive statement” soon after the Queen’s death calling her a “grand and beautiful lady”.\n\nIt appears, however, that President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have received two personal invitations, rather than being asked to form a US delegation, according to CNN, quashing the potential of a US delegation involving Trump. But in what could be considered something of a snub to Trump, there has been speculation that the Obamas might receive “private invites”, said the BBC.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, will also attend, despite the fact that “in the past year there has been a low-key row about whether the EU would be granted full diplomatic status in the post-Brexit UK”, reported The Guardian.\n\nWhat next?\n\nLiz Truss is expected to meet President Biden “as well as other key UK allies such as Anthony Albanese, the Australian leader, and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister”, said The Times.\n\nBut other world leaders “such as Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, are not expected to come as they are not formal heads of state”, said the paper.\n\nOne of the most notable group of attendees will be among the Australian delegation, with ten citizens who have made extraordinary contributions to their communities receiving invitations. One of those selected, Val Dempsey, told The Independent: “As it turned out, it was at the direct request of the Queen. It was in her wishes that ordinary people should come to the funeral and I’ve gotta tell you, I’m extremely ordinary. There’s nothing flash about me.”\n\nPotentially one of the most interesting meetings will be between Truss and President Macron as France is “hoping to open a new chapter in Anglo-French relations after the departure of Boris Johnson”, said The Guardian.\n\nGenerally, though, it appears that the death of the Queen will not be seen as a chance for formal bilateral meetings, “however tempting given the crisis in Ukraine”, added the paper.", "authors": ["Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harold Maass", "Sorcha Bradley", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-possible-successors-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Who might succeed Liz Truss as UK prime minister? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain will have a new prime minister within a week, outgoing leader Liz Truss said in her resignation speech outside 10 Downing Street on Thursday.\n\nThe fast-track process is in stark contrast to the contest that catapulted Truss into the hot seat – that lasted six weeks at the height of the summer.\n\nThis time, with the Conservatives at rock-bottom in the opinion polls and the markets jittery after a weeks of drama over Truss’ failed economic policy agenda, the party wants a new leader in place as soon as possible and with as little drama as possible.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, announced the candidates to replace Truss will need get least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2pm local time Monday.\n\nIf only one candidate meets that threshold, they will automatically become leader. Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election – securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid. The former attorney-general has not run before – but with her hard-line stance on immigration, might look set to drag the party further to the right.\n\nTom Tugendhat emerged as a surprise favorite among Tory members and the wider public, despite only coming fifth in the last leadership election. Having not served as a cabinet member before that contest, Tugendhat distanced himself from the moral mess of Johnson’s government and promised a “clean start” for Britain. After serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tugendhat was made security minister by Truss.\n\nBen Wallace, defense secretary and another ex-military man, was tipped to succeed Johnson in the last leadership contest – polling extremely well among Conservative members. However, he never ran in that election, and he has now ruled himself out of this race.\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May has also been floated as a possible “unity” candidate to succeed Truss. May tried to bring together the warring wings of the Conservative party over Brexit, in move that ultimately saw her replaced by Boris Johnson. As the party has proven unable to resolve its disputes this time round, another attempt at compromise may soon be in order.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956533/can-emmanuel-macron-unite-divided-france", "title": "Can Emmanuel Macron unite a divided France? | The Week", "text": "Emmanuel Macron has vowed to unite France after becoming the country’s first president in 20 years to win re-election.\n\nAddressing a rally at the foot of the Eiffel Tower following his victory over Marine Le Pen yesterday, Macron vowed to be “the president of all of us” and to respond “efficiently” to the “anger and disagreement” of voters who backed his rival.\n\n“I know that a number of French people have voted for me today, not to support my ideas but to stop the ideas of the far-right,” he said.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But his National Rally rival “nonetheless won more than 13 million votes in a historic high for her anti-immigration party”, wrote The Guardian’s Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis.\n\n“Before the caveats,” said BBC’s correspondent Hugh Schofield, “it is only fair to acknowledge the scale of Macron’s achievement.” The election marks “the first time ever that a governing president of the Fifth Republic has been re-elected”.\n\nAnd while former presidents “have retained the Elysée before”, Macron is the first in modern times to win a second term since Jacques Chirac was elected back into the top job in 2002. “Which when you consider France’s long-standing relationship with government – which is essentially to cheer ‘em in, then chuck ‘em out at the first opportunity – is no mean feat,” Schofield continued.\n\nThe result of yesterday’s vote there are “millions of French people of the middling type who feel that Macron has not been at all a bad president”. But Le Pen’s record vote tally also shows “people in France are now prepared to dally with the ‘extremes’”, added Schofield.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe victorious leader of the centrist Le Marche! (On the March!) party has called for unity, urging his supporters to be kind and respectful” to Le Pen voters amid the clear “division” in French society.\n\nBut despite that plea, the vote result triggered violence in cities across France. Police used tear gas to disperse gatherings in Paris, Lyon and Rennes after “several hundred demonstrators from ultra-left groups took to the streets” to protest “Macron’s re-election and Le Pen’s score”, said The Guardian’s Chrisafis.\n\nPolice clash with protestors in Paris (Image credit: Jerome Gilles/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n“There was a large police presence in central Paris hours after the election win, after police opened fire on a car, killing two people inside,” she reported. Whether the incident was linked to the election was unclear.\n\nHealing wounds\n\nMacron may be expected to “toe a more cautious line” following his second victory, said The Telegraph’s correspondent Henry Samuel. The centrist politician is presiding over a country “reeling from successive Yellow Vest revolts, Covid lockdowns and the war in Ukraine”.\n\nAs he heads into his second term, he faces further challenges including maintaining the “Franco-Germany engine” that powers the EU; combating “rising living costs”; overseeing his “controversial” pensions reform; and delivering on a pledge to foster “participative democracy” made during the Yellow Vest protests.\n\nLe Pen’s “powerful showing” could “spell trouble” for the under-pressure president, Politico said, and will serve as a “warning shot to Nato and the European Union”.\n\nEven “in one of the EU’s founding countries”, Macron’s best efforts could not stop millions voting for a figure “whose campaign platform advocates dismantling the EU from within by suspending its free-travel rules and downgrading the supremacy of EU law”.\n\n“The most immediate challenge” for Macron, said the site, is leading a “deeply divided country where political anger could easily boil over into street protests and violence”.\n\nAll the same, said Sky News’ international affairs editor Dominic Waghorn, Macron’s vote victory will have triggered “sighs of relief across Europe”.\n\nWhile his “defeat would have led to a seismic shift in world affairs”, Waghorn continued, his historic second term “means the status quo of the last five years goes on”, with France and Germany at “the spine of Europe” and Macron maintaining his “prominent role leading Europe diplomatically”.\n\nHowever, “the grievances laid bare” by Le Pen’s vote tally “may force him to focus his energies more on domestic issues as he tries to heal the deep divisions exposed during this campaign”.\n\nWarning signs\n\nThe result of the election marks “a personal victory for Macron, who has only run for election twice in his life: each time for the presidency, and each time with success”, The Economist said. “But it also carries warnings.”\n\nHe “has now kept the forces of populism out of France’s highest office twice”, a feat for which “history will judge him well”. But “the second-term president now has his work cut out if he is to renew the appeal of liberal politics, and reverse the steadily growing success of the extremes”, the paper added.\n\nMacron “will no doubt start this second term promising a new kind of government”, said the BBC’s Schofield. “He’ll be more of a listener. He knows there are wounds that need to heal.”\n\nBut another key problem that Macron faces is that “he has said that kind of thing before, and a lot of people simply don’t believe him”.\n\nThe president’s European allies are also likely to be “worried by the deep-seated anger and divisions exposed in this election and concerned by the steadily improving fortunes of the far-right in France”, said Sky News’s Waghorn.\n\nSo if Macron now has to “spends less time on the world stage now and more time healing his country’s domestic politics”, they will surely “not begrudge his absence”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/02/ini-letters-editor-050118/568377002/", "title": "Gov. Eric Holcomb: Building relationships key to securing ...", "text": "IndyStar\n\nIndiana’s path to future economic success is a two-way street. We can’t wait for the world to figure out how wonderful this state is, and it’s not enough to sing our praises from the comfort of our own rooftops and desktops. We have to get out to other states and nations and shout it from their mountaintops.\n\nThat’s why on Sunday I’m traveling to Israel — my fifth international economic development trip since becoming governor. We’ll spend four full days there with a delegation of leaders from the agbiosciences industry to share Indiana’s success and learn from Israel’s experience as a global hub for technology, innovation, and research and development.\n\nAt the same time, arriving Sunday at the Indianapolis International Airport is a delegation of 30 foreign ambassadors across four continents for a mission organized by the U.S. Department of State. For three days, this international delegation from the Experience America Program will meet with Indiana business and community leaders to create new global partnerships and strengthen long-standing ones. Later in May, I’ll make a second economic development trip to Europe — this time visiting Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Switzerland. My last stop will be France, and I’ll fly back on the first-ever non-stop flight from Paris to Indianapolis.\n\nI’m sorry I can’t be there to welcome our international visitors myself, but I know they will enjoy the natural hospitality Hoosiers are famous for everywhere they go. They’ll learn that the heart of our nation is located far from its coasts, right here in the Crossroads of America. They’ll learn about our world-class higher education institutions, our vibrant capital city, the charm of our rural communities — and the ways technology, innovation and entrepreneurship are transforming even our traditional stronghold industries, like farming and manufacturing.\n\nFor Indiana and for the nations represented in this foreign delegation, these trips have immediate and long-term value. We can find commonalities we never expected with nations and people very different from us.\n\nFor example, I’ve found one great need expressed by government and business leaders everywhere I go: finding and developing talent. In Japan, I saw a group of fourth graders in white lab coats tour an advanced manufacturing facility and learn about different career paths available to them in their own backyard. And, this image wasn’t a once-a-year occurrence in the Japanese businesses I visited. Connecting with local primary and secondary schools was just another part of the work these businesses did every day.\n\nThose are the types of ideas you put in your back pocket and take home to share right away. Other trips lead to big wins down the road, like the Infosys announcement we made a couple weeks ago. Rather than outsourcing jobs from America, Infosys is doing the opposite. They are insourcing jobs — on steroids. And, Infosys’ planned $245 million investment is the direct result of an economic development trip we made to India at the end of 2017.\n\nSometimes international investment is the result of positive relationships built and nurtured over many years — spanning generations and many governors. That’s exactly the relationship Indiana has with Japan. More than 290 Japanese businesses operate in our state today, and those companies employ more than 65,000. We took an economic development trip there last year to make sure our Japanese partners understand that Indiana doesn’t take them for granted.\n\nMaking and maintaining connections with people is an investment all of us can make that always pays dividends—whether that’s with our neighbors across the street or across the Atlantic. Indiana’s physical position in the center of the country, our economic position as a state that works for businesses, and our reputation for Hoosier hospitality give us a natural leg-up on other states.\n\nIt’s the two-way street that will take Indiana to the next level.\n\nEric Holcomb\n\nIndiana governor\n\nU.S. needs to welcome refugees here\n\nForget, if we must, the sob stories — the tales of war-ravaged people fleeing for their lives with whatever they can carry on their backs and on their heads and with whichever of their children they can find in the smoldering, terrifying chaos.\n\nForget the broken families, the raped sisters, the years of waiting day after day in makeshift camps for good news that might never come.\n\nForget that any American true to our own traditional values is called to act with compassion.\n\nConsider, instead, this: America needs refugees.\n\nRefugees provide us with a window on those huge parts of the world that most of us would otherwise never see. From them we learn about societal structure, educational priorities, and the penetration of technological advances in places little known or studied. We discern profiles of sickness and health. Refugees introduce us to knowledge, unfamiliar skills, and beliefs held by people of different cultures. They help us understand conflicts that beset other nations — nations in a world we purport to lead.\n\nWe cannot lead, and we cannot advocate effectively for peace, if we are ignorant of these things. Refugees educate us.\n\nThey ease labor shortages in warehouses, factories, farms, hotels and similar establishments suited to workers just learning the language and eager to get a foothold in their new country. Catholic Charities and Exodus Refugee Immigration, Indiana’s resettlement agencies, succeed in ensuring that new refugees who are able to work find decent jobs because enlightened employers who prize refugees’ toughness and enthusiasm seek them out, and demand exceeds supply.\n\nRecounting by phone the medical history of a patient I was referring to a fellow physician, I began, “This is a 35-year-old refugee from Congo who spent 16 years in a camp in Uganda...” My colleague on the other end of the line cut me off.\n\n“What makes him a refugee?” he asked.\n\nLike most Americans I encounter, he did not know. Terms like refugee, immigrant, legal, migrant”, and undocumented were all jumbled up in his mind. He did not know that refugees are by United Nations definition victims of persecution, or that they flee involuntarily, first to a neighboring country, because their lives and the lives of their families depend on them doing so. Refugees leave their homes and all they have ever known not because they want to have an easier life or to earn more money, but because they have no choice. They arrive in the United States — legally — after an arduous screening process that typically takes years.\n\nThanks to its nationwide network of agencies that coordinate with local health-care providers, employers, schools, and government offices, America’s multisector resettlement program has been a recognized global champion for decades. We know from long experience what it takes to begin integrating refugees into their new society, and we are exceptionally good at it.\n\nWe also know what we are getting from it. Most refugees are impoverished when they arrive. Many have had little or no formal schooling. Some have health problems born of years of deprivation. But refugees give back far more than they receive and have qualities—resilience, survivorship, perseverance, passion, selfless love of family, confident faith in the future—that in many ways make them the crème de la crème of humanity. By welcoming them, we get the best.\n\nArguing against America’s acceptance of refugees, a politician recently said to me, “What’s the point — we can’t save them all.” This is true. We can’t. But we can save some of them, and we can certainly save tens of thousands more than we are saving now, and when we do, America will be stronger because of it.\n\nRefugees are our heritage, our founding mothers and fathers, the molders of our institutions and the builders of our roads and railways. They enrich our language, our universities, and our economy. If America is to continue to grow with the lush, bountiful diversity of our past, refugees and all they will become are an essential part of our future.\n\nWe need refugees. They are who we are.\n\nEllen Einterz\n\nRefugee Health, Marion County Public Health Department\n\nSafeguard Indiana's voter registration rolls\n\nDespite the national attention that voter identification laws garner, many may be surprised to learn that the first of its kind was written and survived U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny thanks in part to the sorry state of Indiana’s voter rolls at the time.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the ID law, Indiana participates in the IVRC, otherwise known as the “Crosscheck” system, where state officials compare rolls to identify outdated or duplicate records matched elsewhere. Current legal challenges to the state’s use of such data would set Hoosiers back decades if seen through, however.\n\n\n\nIf one organization had its way, officials would not be entrusted to immediately update a registration even if they had written proof provided by a counterpart that a person subsequently registered in another state. This would handcuff officials from continuing the progress made to maintain our records after Indiana was sued twice for bloated rolls since 2006.\n\n\n\nIndiana is a proving ground for political interests to undercut an already limited set of federal standards for keeping voter rolls updated and reliable. This effort should be disposed of for the joint benefit of the voters and the officials sworn to serve them.\n\nLogan Churchwell\n\nCommunications and Research Director, Public Interest Legal Foundation\n\nTully is right about need to fight smoking\n\nI would like to thank Matthew Tully for his April 13 column, “A way to make Indiana greater — attack smoking.” I agree that our state is long overdue for serious tobacco reform.\n\nSmoking is a leading cause of cancer death in our country. That alone should be enough to inspire our lawmakers to fix Indiana’s smoking problem. But as Tully points out, the General Assembly missed opportunities this past session to increase Indiana’s cigarette tax, improve funding for tobacco cessation programs and raise the minimum age of sale for all tobacco products to 21.\n\nWhy didn’t these proposals receive overwhelming support in the General Assembly, when we all know someone who has been touched by cancer? Having lost my dad to smoking-caused lung cancer, I don’t want anyone else to go through what he and my family had to. Tobacco use is entirely preventable, but Hoosiers won’t be able to avoid or quit an addiction without the tools to fight back.\n\nTully’s ideas for confronting smoking are spot-on. I will continue to urge my lawmakers to support legislation that makes our state healthier.\n\nMillie Sowers\n\nIndianapolis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/biden-warsaw-saturday/index.html", "title": "Biden says Putin 'cannot remain in power' | CNN Politics", "text": "Warsaw, Poland CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden declared forcefully Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin should no longer remain in power, an unabashed challenge that came at the very end of a swing through Europe meant to reinforce Western unity.\n\n“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden announced at the conclusion of a capstone address delivered in the cold outside the Royal Castle in Warsaw.\n\nThe White House afterward downplayed the remark: “The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,” a White House official said. “He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”\n\nThe line was not in Biden’s prepared remarks, a separate White House official said.\n\nBut his remark was already reverberating as Biden departed Poland to return home to Washington after his last-minute trip to attend snap summits in Brussels and to reassure allies along NATO’s eastern edge.\n\nIt was the furthest he had gone in calling for changes atop Russia’s government and reflected a significant escalation in his rhetorical approach to Moscow. US officials had said previously said removing Putin from power was not their goal.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Biden, saying, “This is not to be decided by Mr. Biden. It should only be a choice of the people of the Russian Federation.”\n\nIn his speech, which drew a sharp line between liberal democracies and the type of autocracy Putin oversees, Biden warned of a long fight ahead.\n\n“In this battle we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days, or months, either,” he said.\n\nJust before Biden was set to speak in Poland, an airstrike struck a fuel depot just outside Lviv, Ukraine – about 200 miles away from where the President would speak. The strike caused billowing smoke and flames to rise above the western Ukrainian city, which had largely been seen as a safe haven during the war given its distance from the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nIt was a surprising attack, coming just a day after the Russian military said the first phase of the conflict had ended andthat it was shifting its attention to the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine. After days of Western leaders displaying their united front against Russia, the strike could be seen as a response from Putin and his military to Biden and the West.\n\nBiden, standing along NATO’s eastern edge, in Poland, issued a stern warning during his speech, telling Putin: “Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.” He said the US was committed to the collective protection obligations laid out in NATO’s charter “with the full force of our collective power.”\n\nBut Biden made clear the current conflict in Ukraine – not a NATO member – doesn’t require America to become directly involved.\n\n“American forces are not in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces, American forces are here to defend NATO,” he said.\n\nBiden opened his address saying that Ukraine is now a front line battle in the fight between autocracy and democracy, casting Russia’s invasion of its neighbor as part of the decades-long battle that has played out between the West and the Kremlin.\n\n“My message to the people of Ukraine is … we stand with you. Period,” said Biden.\n\nBiden cites lessons learned in 20th century Europe\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden cited a dark history of US hesitance with involving itself in Europe’s wars as an example of how the continent’s security is in the American national interest, a striking comment illustrating the about-face in US foreign policy from the last administration.\n\n“America’s ability to meet its role in other parts of the world rests upon a united Europe and a secure Europe,” Biden said Saturday as he met with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw. “We have learned from sad experiences in two world wars, when we’ve stayed out of and not been involved in stability in Europe, it always comes back to haunt the United States.”\n\nBiden’s comments came during the final day of a last-minute trip to Europe aimed at synchronizing how Western allies address Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Biden and Duda spent a lengthy stretch in a one-on-one meeting before beginning an expanded session with aides. Biden said he raised the world war comparisons during the private meeting.\n\nIn brief remarks, Biden repeatedly cited America’s commitment to NATO’s Article V pledge of common defense, and noted he was a main proponent of Polish membership in NATO when he was a senator 25 years ago.5\n\n“We take Article 5 as a sacred commitment, not a throwaway, a sacred commitment that relates to every member of NATO,” Biden said, insisting that members must remain “absolutely, completely thoroughly united.”\n\nThe President’s comments are a sharp contrast from the “America First” foreign policy of former President Donald Trump, who called NATO “obsolete” before he came into office and often questioned the value of American alliances with European nations. Trump’s time in office was marked by his spats with foreign leaders and the often-contentious nature of his dealings with traditional American allies in Europe and across the globe.\n\nGiven this recent history, NATO’s strength and unity had been questioned in recent years. Biden told Duda that he was sure Putin “was counting on being able to divide NATO and separate the eastern flank from the west, and separate nations based on past histories. But he wasn’t able to do it.”\n\nAnd noting that Poland had taken in millions of refugees fleeing violence in Ukraine, Biden made a point of referencing migrants seeking entry into the United States at its southern border. But he said the US must also take in people fleeing the war in Europe.\n\n“We have, in our southern border, thousands of people a day – literally, not figuratively – trying to get into the United States,” he said. “But we believe that we, the United States, should do our part relative to Ukraine as well, by opening our borders to another 100,000 people.”\n\nBiden meets Ukrainian officials in Warsaw\n\nEarlier Saturday, Biden met Ukrainian government officials who had traveled to Warsaw for engagements with their American counterparts. Biden’s visit to Europe has been entirely focused on the war, but the talks with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov were the first time Biden was able to meet face-to-face with officials from Ukraine during his tour.\n\nAs it got underway, Kuleba described an arduous journey from Kyiv to Warsaw that included a train and three hours in a car.\n\n“It’s like flying from Kyiv to Washington with a connecting flight in Istanbul,” Kuleba said. “The good thing is that since the beginning of the war I’ve learned how to sleep under any conditions. So I slept on the train, I slept in the car.”\n\nBiden, on hearing how the ministers had traveled, relayed that he, too, had made many journeys by train.\n\n“You’re looking at a fellow who’s traveled over a million, 200,000 miles on a train. Literally,” Biden said. Biden commuted from his home in Delaware to Washington as a senator and vice president on Amtrak trains.\n\nThe group meeting at a hotel in Warsaw, which also included Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, delved into more substantive issues later. A White House readout said the men discussed “further efforts to help Ukraine defend its territory.”\n\nThe United States is considering sanctioning Russian companies that make supplies for the Russian military, sources familiar with the option told CNN following the meeting, though an official decision hasn’t been made. Kuleba said he believed Biden administration officials were “keen to move on with further sanctions.”\n\nUkraine has been pressuring the US and NATO to increase the military assistance they are providing to Ukraine, including calls from President Volodymyr Zelensky to establish a no-fly zone.\n\nAfter talks in Brussels this week, during which Zelensky appeared virtually, it did not appear NATO members had warmed to the idea. Biden has said becoming more directly involved in the conflict could usher in World War III.\n\nThat left Ukraine’s leaders dismayed. “We are very disappointed, in all honesty. We expect more bravery. Expected some bold decisions. The alliance has taken decisions as if there’s no war,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, in a live interview with the Atlantic Council on Friday.\n\nA focus on refugees on trip’s final day\n\nWhile Biden is meeting with refugees in Warsaw, he said on Friday that he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective.\n\n“They will not let me – understandably, I guess – cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine,” he said. The White House has said it did not explore a visit to Ukraine.\n\nThe visit to Ukraine’s western neighbor comes as Poland has, on several fronts, urged the US to do more in the war.\n\nFor example, Duda has asked the US to speed up and simplify the procedures allowing Ukrainians with family in the US to come to the country.\n\nMore than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency released on Tuesday. A vast majority of those refugees have fled to Ukraine’s western neighbors across Europe.\n\nPoland, which borders Ukraine to the west, has registered more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country, though not all refugees who have entered Poland remain there.\n\nBiden met with chef José Andrés and other volunteers in Warsaw Saturday at a food distribution site for Andrés’ World Center Kitchen, the nonprofit devoted to providing meals in the wake of disasters.\n\nBiden met with some of the volunteers, some from Europe and some from the United States.\n\n“God love ya,” the President could be heard saying to them and asking if he could help them.\n\nFollowing his meeting with refugees at Stadion Narodowy, Biden was asked by reporters what seeing the Ukrainian refugees made him think of as he deals with Putin every day. Biden responded, “He’s a butcher.”\n\nThere are other issues connected to the war in Ukraine that have been top of mind in Poland.\n\nUS has continued to reject Poland’s proposal to facilitate the transfer of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. And the Polish President has called for a more permanent NATO defense posture in the country along with an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine.\n\nUS officials have not warmed to the peacekeeping proposition, suggesting it could violate Biden’s red line of keeping US troops out of the conflict.\n\nDuring Friday’s meeting with humanitarian workers, Duda said Biden’s “presence here sends a great signal and evidence of unity – unity within NATO.”\n\nThe Polish President added that Biden’s visit “demonstrates a huge support and also a big significance attached by the United States to the stability and world peace, to reinstating the peace where difficult situations are happening in places where somebody resorts to acts of aggression against other democratic and free nations – as it is happening today against Ukraine where the Russian aggression, unfortunately, happening for a month now is effect.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/us-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs/index.html", "title": "White House announces new sanctions on Russian oligarchs | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden imposed new sanctions Thursday on eight members of the Russian elite, along with members of their families, as he warned Russia is intensifying its bloody invasion of Ukraine with indiscriminate bombing.\n\nThe new sanctions are the Biden administration’s latest attempt to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin as the invasion of Ukraine advances.\n\n“The goal is to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia,” Biden said, accusing the oligarchs he is targeting of lining “their pockets with Russian people’s money while Ukraine and the people are hiding in the subway from missiles that are being fired indiscriminately.”\n\n“Our interest is to maintain the strongest unified economic campaign on Putin in all history, and I think we’re really on the way to doing that,” Biden said.\n\nThe new list of individuals described as “Putin’s cronies and their family members” will be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.\n\nThere will be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.\n\nIt includes a move to target Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, “one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals,” according to the White House, and will include his super-yacht and private jet.\n\nThe US is also sanctioning Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, whom the White House describes as “a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda.”\n\n“The United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains,” the fact sheet said.\n\nAccording to the White House, the individuals who will be subject to full blocking sanctions are:\n\nNikolai Tokarev (along with his wife Galina, daughter Mayya and two luxury real estate companies)\n\nBoris Rotenberg (along with wife Karina, and sons Roman and Boris)\n\nArkady Rotenberg (along with sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya)\n\nSergei Chemezov (along with wife Yekaterina, son Stanislav and stepdaughter Anastasiya)\n\nIgor Shuvalov (along with five companies, wife Olga, son Evgeny, his company and jet, daughter Maria and her company)\n\nYevgeniy Prigozhin (along with his three companies, wife, Polina, daughter Lyubov, and son Pavel),\n\nPeskov, Putin’s press secretary\n\nAlisher Usmanov\n\nThe US will also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates, the fact sheet from the White House said.\n\nThat will target oligarchs “known to direct, authorize, fund, significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of Russia’s destabilizing foreign policy.”\n\nAnd the Department of Treasury will also issue sanctions on disinformation targets. That includes SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton; SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United World International; and Geopolitical.\n\nIt will also designate “26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles in these organizations, enabling the Government of the Russian Federation’s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions as a part of their invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nBiden has vowed to go after the “ill-begotten gains” of Russian oligarchs, including their private jets, luxury apartments and yachts. The Justice Department announced a task force Wednesday comprised of various US law enforcement agencies designed to enforce sanctions against oligarchs, calling the initiative “Kleptocapture.”\n\nBiden is scheduled to assemble his Cabinet for a meeting Thursday afternoon as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its second week and most of his administration is involved in the US response.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting, which is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, is expected to focus much more heavily on foreign policy than usual, CNN has reported. The President is expected to make brief remarks at the start of the meeting on the latest developments in Ukraine.\n\nIt is the fourth Cabinet meeting of Biden’s presidency. Nearly every agency or department expected to be represented at the meeting has played some type of role in the administration’s response to the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris traveled to Germany last month to meet with allies and deliver a message from the US at the Munich Security Conference. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has assumed overall responsibility for military aid to Ukraine, including the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that were delivered this week. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has quarterbacked the sanctions packages rolled out over the last week by the administration and also worked with phones with counterparts in Europe to ensure they are aligned. The Biden administration is planning to impose new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and members of their families as soon as Thursday, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday the “Kleptocapture” task force meant to go after oligarchs’ yachts, private jets and luxury apartments. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s department has assumed responsibility for the export controls levied on Russia and Belarus that restricts critical technology. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration, which enforces the ban on Russian flights in US airspace.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm worked this week to coordinate the release of 30 million barrels from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, along with other nations. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will have oversight of potential temporary protection status for Ukrainian refugees, along with ensuring there are no spillover security concerns within the US.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines has led the US intelligence community at one of its most extraordinary junctures as the Biden team employs a strategy of declassifying and releasing intelligence about Russia’s intentions and plans. She also traveled to Europe to coordinate intelligence sharing with allies.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has assumed her highest-profile yet with speeches at the Security Council and General Assembly castigating Russia for its invasion. Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young will head-up White House efforts to secure $10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will not be in attendance because he is traveling to Europe for meetings today with NATO allies.\n\nThe President dedicated a large portion of his State of the Union address on Tuesday to the conflict as Ukraine’s cities continue to be attacked by Russian forces.\n\nOne million refugees have fled Ukraine in just a week, according to the United Nations, as Russian troops attempt to press further into the nation.\n\nUkrainian forces have so far been able to stave off Russia’s initial push and have maintained control of Kyiv and other major cities, but Russia is now bringing in more destructive weaponry and increasingly striking civilian infrastructure, CNN has reported. As the invasion enters a second week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pleading for more international assistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for the invasion, including harsh new sanctions and export controls aimed at imposing severe costs on the Russian economy.\n\nBiden announced on Tuesday the US would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace, joining a growing number of countries who have closed their skies to Russia. The US and its allies have also agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves.\n\nThe US will also prohibit American dollar transactions with the Russian central bank and fully block the Russian direct investment fund to prevent Russia from mitigating some of the effects of the sanctions.\n\nThe White House, along with the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada, announced this weekend they would expel certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world. In a major break from its longstanding neutrality, Switzerland also announced it would join the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russia.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Betsy Klein Phil Mattingly Kaitlan Collins Kate Sullivan", "Kevin Liptak", "Betsy Klein", "Phil Mattingly", "Kaitlan Collins", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/05/politics/joe-biden-russia-ukraine-war/index.html", "title": "Biden and his team believe Russia's war in Ukraine could define his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nMore than a week into Russia’s war in Ukraine, President Joe Biden and his team at the White House are settling in for what many of them believe will become one of the defining backdrops to his presidency: A grinding war in Europe led by an increasingly unsound combatant.\n\nOfficials told CNN they believe the coming hours and days could be potentially the bloodiest so far, with intensifying violence directed toward civilians as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues his advance toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The Kremlin leader is frustrated by a slower than expected start – initially believing Kyiv could fall in as little as 72 hours, according to US assessments.\n\nShipments of American weapons — including Javelin and Stinger missiles that can debilitate tanks and aircraft, respectively — have arrived as part of the $350 million package Biden signed last week, an expedited attempt to bolster Ukraine’s defenses.\n\nBiden has dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris back to Europe to reassure US allies as the largest ground war on the continent since World War II presses on. Harris will visit Poland and Romania next week “to demonstrate the strength and unity of the NATO Alliance and US support for NATO’s eastern flank allies in the face of Russian aggression,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe prospect of more sanctions, including a ban on Russian oil imports to the United States, has gained traction among Democrats and Republicans alike and Biden continues to weigh the potential benefits.\n\nAnd US officials are continuing to urgently examine Putin’s mindset and motivations as Western leaders who have met with him describe an isolated and altered man dead set on recomposing the old Soviet Union. In meetings among officials, concern has been raised about what Putin might do as he feels the squeeze of international condemnation.\n\n“The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more suffering and more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday.\n\nFor Biden, the war has consumed what he once hoped would be a spring focused on traveling the country to deliver a revamped economic message. Top advisers view the current period as the most critical of his presidency, with nothing less than global stability in the balance. From the Oval Office, Situation Room and, in the early morning and late evening, the Treaty Room in his residence, Biden has sought to corral a united Western alliance against Russia’s aggression.\n\n“The way to deal with autocracy – the way to deal with dictators – is a united, united front among our allies,” Biden told historian Heather Cox Richardson in an interview that was posted online Friday. “Now we’re united. And it’s going to be very difficult for the autocrats to succeed.”\n\nThat may have been an optimistic outlook, at least as far as Putin is concerned. Even Biden has voiced a belief that the Russian leader doesn’t intend to stop the war at Ukraine’s borders.\n\nAn international crisis replaces a health emergency\n\nJust as the Covid-19 pandemic recedes as the issue that occupies the President’s days, the war in Ukraine has emerged as an hour-by-hour crisis, sending Biden and his team into the Situation Room nearly every day for secure video conferences and phone calls with other world leaders. Aides say the crisis in Ukraine looms over Biden’s schedule so much that while other issues have set times to be discussed, he receives near constant updates on the invasion from his national security team.\n\nThe first 12 minutes of his State of the Union address this week focused only on Ukraine. The scope of the administration’s response was also clear during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, as nearly every department or agency head sitting around the table was somehow involved in the US reaction to the war.\n\nFrom his bunker in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has phoned the White House every few days – often at his request – from a secure satellite phone provided to him by the US government, always pressing for more assistance and greater punishment on Moscow.\n\nDespite conversations with the US about contingency plans for leaving Ukraine and forming a government-in-exile somewhere in Europe, Zelensky has shown no signs he is willing to leave his besieged country.\n\nIn a Facebook address late Friday, Zelensky condemned NATO’s decision to rule out the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country – a decision Biden backs since it would put American forces in direct opposition to Russia. Putin said Saturday that the imposition of a no-fly zone would be “considered by us as participation in an armed conflict.”\n\n“We believe that NATO countries have created a narrative that closing the skies over Ukraine would provoke Russia’s direct aggression against NATO,” Zelensky said. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have.”\n\nZelensky’s pleas have put Biden in the difficult position of denying an embattled leader what he’s asking for, though the White House insists it is responding rapidly to every request it can accommodate.\n\nWhen White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked Friday how Biden had “hardened himself” to watching atrocities unfold in Ukraine without sending US troops to help, she responded forcefully.\n\n“We are not watching; the President is leading the world in responding to this,” she said. “However, he is not going to put US military men and women serving on the front lines of battle and Ukraine to fight Russia. That has never been his plan, never been his policy, and he has no intention of doing that.”\n\nAll eyes on Putin’s next moves\n\nMultiple rounds of historically severe sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and industries have not yet led Putin to change course, even as they inflicted immediate damage on his country’s economy. As Russia becomes more isolated, and many of its residents leave, some American officials have wondered whether – and how – Putin will lash out.\n\n“He’s attacking right now because he has a goal. And he’s not going to let up on this goal. He’s not [at] a point in time where he can show this kind of weakness, so he has to keep going,” said Beth Sanner, a former top intelligence official who is now a CNN national security contributor. “So, the question is does he feel confident enough – despite his claims of everything being on track. Clearly, that’s not the case – does he feel comfortable enough that he is on the right track that he just sticks with that, or is he feeling more and more cornered?”\n\n“Some really big choices are coming on what to do on sanctions. Oil and gas sanctions could indeed lead to that backlash. It’s a dilemma at this point,” Sanner said.\n\nBiden administration officials are actively considering banning imports of Russian crude oil, though they have yet to decide and are still assessing how such a move would impact the market.\n\n“We are looking at options that we can take right now if we were to cut the US consumption of Russian energy, but what’s really most important is that we maintain a steady supply of global energy,” Cecilia Rouse, the chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Friday.\n\nThe administration is now facing bipartisan pressure from lawmakers to act, which only increased after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she supported a full ban.\n\n“I’m all for that. Ban it,” Pelosi said.\n\nUS officials have been cautious not to escalate tensions beyond where they already stand. When Putin ordered his nuclear forces into “special combat readiness” last weekend, Biden and his team chose not to follow suit, writing off the move as theatrics.\n\nAnd after the US Embassy in Kyiv declared that Russia’s attack on a nuclear power plant a “war crime” – bypassing Biden’s stance that it was too early to make such a declaration – the State Department issued an urgent directive to other embassies not to amplify the statement.\n\n“All – do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime,” the message said. “If you have retweeted it – un-retweet it ASAP.”\n\nOfficials said privately the urgent message reflected a desire to follow the legal process when it comes to declaring something a war crime.\n\nBiden believes Putin wants to re-establish the USSR\n\nFor Biden, the war in Ukraine is the culmination of a nearly five-decade career in foreign policy that placed a premium on trans-Atlantic ties, including eight years as the Obama administration’s frontman on Ukraine. Having once famously observed to Putin’s face that he believed he “had no soul,” Biden is now watching that claim play out in real time.\n\nPutin’s frame of mind has increasingly become an urgent matter for US intelligence and national security officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Biden has been briefed by Russia experts on his team that the Russian leader is operating partly based on emotion and a warped view of history.\n\nAfter a call with Putin this week, French President Emmanuel Macron came away believing the Russian leader was intent on seeing his invasion through.\n\n“This conversation is unfortunately an occasion to hear that President Putin will continue military interventions and to go all the way,” a source at the Élysée said afterward.\n\nPutin has isolated himself during the coronavirus pandemic, restricting the number of advisers he interacts with to a small group. And American officials believe his thinking has turned more extreme over that period, owing in part to the limited number of viewpoints reaching him.\n\nBiden’s aides have refused to diagnose Putin’s frame of mind in public. But they have made plain they see his behavior as a shift.\n\n“I’m not going to get into Putin’s mental state. What I am going to say is he has done something now that he hasn’t before, which is launched a completely unprovoked, unjustified invasion of Ukraine,” White House chief of staff Ron Klain said on CNN this week.\n\nWhile some American officials, along with others in Europe who have engaged directly with Putin, believe the Russian leader to have grown more mentally unbalanced in recent years, Biden has not endorsed that assessment in public or in private.\n\nInstead, he has deemed Putin clear-eyed in his goal: “Trying to re-establish the Soviet Union, basically,” he said in an aside this week.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/politics/trump-putin-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Trump has been on Putin's side in Ukraine's long struggle against ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmericans rarely pay much attention to international events. Busy lives leave little time for distant events with unfamiliar protagonists.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has become a rare exception, its butchery in plain view via saturation coverage for anyone with a video screen. But Americans may not yet have absorbed this disturbing reality: The American president who left office just 14 months ago sided with the butcher.\n\nThat’s right: In the struggle now uniting the free world against an autocrat’s lawless aggression, America’s most recent ex-President sided with the autocrat.\n\nIt’s not just that Donald Trump recently hailed the “genius” of Putin’s strike against Ukraine. Since his political career began, Trump has backed Putin in ways connected directly to the Russian’s quest to subjugate that country.\n\nFor years, relations between Russia and the celebrity real estate executive were lubricated by money. There was the development financing Trump’s sons boasted about, the Palm Beach mansion he sold to a Russian oligarch for $95 million four years after buying it for $41 million, the Manhattan project in association with a mob-linked Russian émigré.\n\nHe sought to place a Trump Tower in Moscow even as he ran for president. In 2013, when he staged a beauty pageant there, Trump asked on Twitter: “Will (Putin) become my new best friend?”\n\nPutin seized Crimea from Ukraine the following year. Protests in Kyiv had forced a Kremlin ally to quit the presidency. The ousted president, who fled to Russia, had been advised by an American political consultant. That consultant, Paul Manafort, subsequently became Trump’s 2016 campaign manager.\n\nCandidate Trump spoke forgivingly about Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. He mused about lifting sanctions to smooth relations with Putin.\n\n“The people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” Trump told ABC News in July 2016. That had been Putin’s justification for the invasion.\n\nPresident Trump sought to undo one punishment imposed on Putin by proposing that Russia rejoin the G7, an organization of the world’s major industrial economies. Other members, who had teamed with the US to kick Russia out during Barack Obama’s presidency, declined to go along.\n\nHis administration implemented some new sanctions on Russia at the insistence of national security officials and Congress. Trump himself objected.\n\n“In almost every case, the sanctions were imposed with Trump complaining about it and saying we were being too hard,” his former national security adviser John Bolton said on Newsmax recently.\n\nRussia menaced Ukraine throughout Trump’s term. He strengthened Putin’s hand in several ways.\n\nTrump cast doubt on America’s decades-old commitment to defending European partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Aides feared he might try to withdraw from NATO if he won a second term.\n\nHe fomented discord at home, advancing Putin’s objective of sapping American resolve. “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people,” his former Defense Secretary James Mattis said in 2020.\n\nTrump shielded Russia from opprobrium. Echoing Russian propaganda, he led fellow Republicans in smearing Ukraine by falsely suggesting that Kyiv rather than Moscow had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\n“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” Fiona Hill, who had directed Russia policy on Trump’s National Security Council, told a congressional impeachment inquiry in 2019.\n\nRepublicans protecting Trump cast the impeachment as Democratic partisanship. But it traced back to Trump’s alignment with Russia against its vulnerable neighbor.\n\nCongress had voted to provide Ukraine nearly $400 million in military aid. Trump delayed sending it.\n\n“I would like you to do us a favor,” Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their infamous July 2019 telephone call.\n\nThe favor was for Zelensky to smear presidential rival Joe Biden by investigating him and his son, Hunter. Zelensky never complied.\n\nThings haven’t worked out as either Trump or Putin wanted.\n\nTrump lost his reelection bid. Biden, who defeated him, now leads the global effort to stop Putin’s aggression.\n\nInstead of splintering under military and economic pressure, NATO and the European Union have pulled together in support of Ukraine. Within the US, the two normally brawling political parties have joined to condemn Russian savagery.\n\nRepublican senators who voted to acquit Trump of those impeachment charges applauded as Biden excoriated the Russian leader in last week’s State of the Union address. A Republican-sponsored “Putin Accountability Act” in Congress seeks to sanction, among others, the Russian oligarch who more than doubled Trump’s money on that Palm Beach mansion.\n\nEven Trump has changed his tune. A week after praising Putin’s strategic acumen, he denounced Russia’s attack on Ukraine as “a holocaust.”\n\nThe former President remains the leading candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2024. But the longer the bloodshed in Ukraine goes on, the bigger a liability Putin will become.\n\nTrump and those around him had wanted the controversy to go away. His former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who listened in the notorious Trump-Zelensky call, berated a reporter who asked about Ukraine a few months later.\n\n“Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” Pompeo shouted at National Public Radio’s Mary Louise Kelly.\n\nThey may not have cared then. Unfortunately for Trump, they care now.", "authors": ["John Harwood"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}]}

The current migrant figure includes August, but not September, the last month of this fiscal year, which has yet to be announced.\n\nAbout 2.2 million people were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border through August, compared to 2.38 million border encounters for all of last year.\n\n\"They've already exceeded last year's totals by now. There's no doubt. The encounters probably beat 2022 sometime during the middle of this month,\" said Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight for Washington on Latin America (WOLA), a nonprofit advocacy organization. Isacson, who researches border security, said it's possible the overall migrant encounter number this year could reach 3 million or more. \"It looks like it's on pace,\" he said.\n\nThe latest numbers come as some Americans are getting frustrated with migrants arriving in their neighborhoods with limited shelter and assistance options. Many said they want the federal government and local officials to do more to provide help to those in need and find a better solution for migrants hoping to enter the U.S.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from? Venezuela, Nicaragua and more\n\nIsacson said the migrant arrivals, mostly asylum seekers, at the U.S.-Mexico border have now risen to about 8,000 migrants daily. It's a level last seen in April, before the termination of Title 42, a COVID-19 pandemic policy that allowed the U.S. to cite fears of spreading the virus as a reason to expel migrants.\n\n\"I think that's going to be the new normal, this current high level seems to be the baseline and it's changing quickly. It could go up to 10,000 migrants,\" said Isacson about the daily arrivals, adding that migrants from Venezuela, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador are trying to enter the country. \"Parts of the world, especially Latin America, haven't recovered from the pandemic and their economies have worsened and some governments have been dictatorial as of late.\"\n\nIsacson added that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said during a press conference last week that U.S. authorities encountered more than 142,000 migrants at the border during the first half of September, according to CBP figures. That's slightly more than half of the August total of 232,000.\n\nBecause of various upheavals in their homelands, many migrant arrivals today have \"fewer social ties than in the past\" to the U.S. as they \"now need more of a safety net,\" said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst with the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute.\n\nWhy are so many migrants arriving in the US?\n\nMany migrants are seeking to improve their lives, find jobs, and places to seek refuge, be it in shelters, hotels, community centers, airports, bus stops, and even sidewalks, experts said.\n\n\"The flow is continuous,\" said Laura Cruz-Acosta, a city spokeswoman in El Paso, Texas, a border town accustomed to welcoming migrants. The city receives more than 1,800 migrants a day but is now feeling somewhat strained as its shelters are over capacity, she said.\n\nMayor Oscar Leeser said at a news conference on Sept. 23 that the city had reached \"a breaking point.\" The city's data dashboard showed Thursday that 7,600 migrants were in CPB custody, and more than 1,300 were being released into the city daily.\n\nWhy are Abbott, DeSantis sending migrants to NYC?\n\nThe migrants have sparked both local and federal debates among government officials.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has blamed a lack of federal aid and Republican Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida, who's also a GOP presidential candidate, for sending asylum-seekers to Northern states in recent months and causing a crisis.\n\nDuring a speech in New York City Wednesday, Abbott said he sent 15,800 migrants to New York City, about 10% of the nearly 120,000 who have arrived there in the past year.\n\n\"What you're dealing with in New York, what you are seeing and witnessing in this state is a tiny fraction of what's happening every single day in the state of Texas,\" Abbott said. \"This is unsustainable, and those are the words of your mayor. Those are the words of the mayors of Chicago and Los Angeles. Those are the words of the governor of Texas. What’s going on is unsustainable. It’s a crisis that’s chaotic and must stop.\"\n\nAbbott's criticism didn't stop there. He also took aim at President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden can flip that switch any day and stop New York from having to deal with the consequences of an open border,\" Abbott said. \"They must prevail upon their president for more than just money. They need a change in policy.\"\n\nIn response, Adams' office said in a statement, \"If he genuinely wanted to be part of the solution to this humanitarian crisis, Gov. Abbott would urge his Republican colleagues in Congress to collaborate with President Biden on desperately needed and long overdue immigration reform.\"\n\nWhite House says Congress must pass immigration reform\n\nA White House spokesperson said in a statement that Biden has called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\"Without Congressional action, this Administration has been working to build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system and we’ve led the largest expansion of lawful pathways for immigration in decades,\" the statement said. \"The federal government is working to provide information and services to ensure that those who are eligible submit their work permit applications immediately.\"\n\nMost of those big U.S. cities weren't prepared for the arrival of migrants en masse ranging from single adults to large families with small children, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst with the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\"It's not like migrants haven't been going to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C.,\" Putzel-Kavanaugh said. \"They are arriving in larger numbers and those larger numbers are exacerbating the situation.\"\n\nHow many migrants arrive at the US-Mexico border each month?\n\nIn August, there were 232,972 migrant encounters, either arrests or detainments, at the southern border (the most since December 2002), a spike from the 183,494 encountered in July and the 144,570 encountered in June, according to Customs and Border Protection. Last month's figure is also an increase from 204,087 encounters in August 2022.\n\nWithin the last five- to 10 years, the Border Patrol has been dealing with \"different flows of migrants, changes in their nationalities and demographics, and the tools Border Patrol have at their disposal aren't fit for that,\" said Putzel-Kavanaugh, of the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officials said migrants without any legal basis to stay will be processed for removal and face consequences that include a minimum five-year bar on re-entry, loss of eligibility to access lawful pathways, and prosecution for repeat offenders.\n\n\"We remain vigilant and expect to see fluctuations, knowing that smugglers continue to use misinformation to prey on vulnerable individuals. CBP is executing our operational plans and working to decompress areas along the southwest border,\" a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We are safely and efficiently vetting and processing migrants to place them in immigration enforcement proceedings consistent with our laws and operational planning efforts.\"\n\nIllegal border crossings worth the risk for some\n\nFor many migrants who travel hundreds, if not thousands of miles, many with their families, to get to the U.S., they may think it's worth the risk, said Victor Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol chief in the El Paso sector and the director of the Center for Law and Human Behavior at the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\nHe said many migrants come to the U.S. to work. He pointed to a decision this month from the Department of Homeland Security that it would grant Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. as of July 31 to help ease a path to work authorization. The TPS is in addition to nearly 243,000 Venezuelans who already qualified for the temporary status.\n\nManjarrez said many migrants tend to believe what smugglers and others who are misinformed tell them, rather than government officials.\n\nIsacson, the defense director of WOLA, said while there may be a lot of policies migrants have to contend with, many of them might assume it can't be as bad as what they've endured to get to the U.S.\n\n\"When you compare risking your life going through a jungle, a desert, or the Rio Grande to escape living in a dangerous slum in Caracas (Venezuela),\" Isacson said. \"Compared to that kind of life, they probably think there's no level of misery that these policies can impose that is worse than what they are fleeing from.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/us-mexico-border-crossing-deaths/index.html", "title": "First on CNN: A record number of migrants have died crossing the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly 750 migrants have died at the southern border this fiscal year, a record that surpasses last year’s total by more than 200 people, according to Department of Homeland Security figures shared with CNN.\n\nMigrants often face treacherous terrain when crossing the border – including oppressive desert heat, dangerous waters and falling from the border wall.\n\nSince October 1, which marks the start of the fiscal year, there have been 748 deaths, a Homeland Security official told CNN, with a month still left to go in the fiscal year. That’s up from 557 southwest border deaths during fiscal year 2021, the previous record.\n\nThe figures don’t always capture all deaths, as other state and local agencies may recover bodies without Border Patrol involvement, meaning the number of deaths is likely higher.\n\nLast week, the bodies of at least eight migrants trying to cross the US border from Mexico were found in the Rio Grande, Customs and Border Protection said. The remains were discovered by agents and Mexican authorities while rescuing other migrants in the river.\n\nAn increasing number of migrants continue to appear at the US-Mexico border as conditions deteriorate in Latin America.

In fiscal year 2020, there were 247 deaths and 300 deaths in 2019, marking a significant increase amid a 30-record year for border crossings. The agency data on deaths dates to 1998.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection declined to comment on the figures, but said smugglers are taking advantage of desperate migrants.\n\n“Transnational criminal organizations continue to recklessly endanger the lives of individuals they smuggle for their own financial gain with no regard for human life,” CBP said in a statement. “Smuggling organizations are abandoning migrants in remote and dangerous areas, leading to a rise in the number of rescues but also tragically a rise in the number of deaths. The terrain along the border is extreme, the summer heat is severe, and the miles of desert migrants must hike after crossing the border in many areas are unforgiving.”\n\nSo far this fiscal year, there have been nearly 19,000 searches and rescues along the US southern border, according to CBP – an increase from 12,833 in fiscal year 2021.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2020/08/06/apprehensions-us-mexico-border-el-paso-sector-fall-sharply-july/3310552001/", "title": "Apprehensions at US-Mexico border, El Paso Sector fall sharply in ...", "text": "Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped by roughly half in July, including in El Paso, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Thursday.\n\nApprehensions and encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border fell year over year to 40,746 last month, down from 81,777 in July 2019, according to CBP.\n\nIn the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector — which includes part of West Texas and all of New Mexico — apprehensions and encounters in July were about half of what they were a year ago.

Three takeaways as Title ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Pandemic-era immigration restrictions are finally gone, but what that means for the U.S.-Mexico border is unclear.\n\nThe Biden administration said Monday that it was still assessing the impact of the end of controversial immigration rules known as Title 42, which made it easier to expel migrants at the southern border. The rules, which ended Thursday, had been in place for three years as part of the federal public health emergency for COVID-19.\n\nThousands of migrants have been waiting in Mexico for the restrictions to end, and analysts predicted chaos and a surge of migrants looking to cross the border once the policy was lifted. So far, that hasn't happened.\n\n\"The situation on the border is very fluid,\" said Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant secretary for border and immigration policy. \"This is a continuously evolving situation that we are monitoring in real time.\"\n\nHere are three takeaways from administration’s termination of the policy.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDire prediction:Biden says border will be `chaotic for a while' when Title 42 ends\n\nNo migrant surge after Title 42. But could it still happen?\n\nIn the days leading up to the end of Title 42, the U.S. averaged roughly 10,000 migrant encounters a day along the U.S.-Mexico border as immigrants sought to enter the U.S. before the policy was terminated. Those numbers were expected to surge after the termination of Title 42.\n\nIt's early, but administration officials said they haven’t seen any signs of a surge. In fact, the opposite has occurred.\n\nThe border has remained relatively calm in the four days since Title 42 ended, and the number of migrants crossing illegally has dropped by 50%, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe U.S. has averaged fewer than 5,000 migrant encounters a day since Title 42 was terminated, Nuñez-Neto said.\n\nIt’s too soon to draw any conclusions about why the numbers are down, Nuñez-Neto said.\n\nBut several factors could be playing a role.\n\nFor one, the administration has revamped the system to crack down on illegal crossings and to offer a new legal pathway for migrants who often pay thousands of dollars to smugglers to get them across the border.\n\nAlthough Border Patrol agents can no longer expel migrants for public health reasons, the administration has a new rule that migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border will be turned away unless they’ve first applied online or sought protection in a country they’ve passed through.\n\nMigrants caught crossing illegally won’t be allowed to return for five years. They can be criminally prosecuted if they attempt to cross again. Families allowed in as their immigration cases progress will face curfews and GPS monitoring.\n\nAnother factor that might be deterring migrants from crossing the border is that Mexico has deployed large numbers of law enforcement and military troops along its border in recent days in anticipation of the expiration of Title 42.\n\nFor subscribers:'Psychological torture': These Venezuelan migrants were among final expulsions under Title 42\n\nPanama and Colombia also have undertaken a joint effort to crack down on networks that smuggle migrants across the border.\n\nEven so, “we are mindful that smugglers will continue to look for ways to take advantage of the change in border policies,” Nuñez-Neto said.\n\nIt’s also important to note, Nuñez-Neto said, that the conditions that are causing migrants to flee their homes and cross illegally into the U.S. haven’t changed. Those conditions include extreme poverty, violence and war.\n\n“We continue to see more displaced people in the hemisphere than we have in decades,” he said.\n\nWhat's next?When Title 42 expires, will migrants be prosecuted for crossing border illegally?\n\nWhat happens to migrants seeking asylum?\n\nThe Biden administration has expelled thousands of migrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally since the end of Title 42.\n\nU.S. authorities have returned to enforcing the nation's immigration laws under Title 8, a section of the U.S. code that spells out who is admissible to the country, criminal penalties for crossing the border illegally and the expedited removal of migrants who are deemed inadmissible.\n\nSince Friday, hundreds of migrants, including Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans, have been returned to Mexico. Thousands, including single adults and families, have been sent home to more than 10 countries, including Colombia, Honduras and Peru, Nuñez-Neto said.\n\nThousands more were being held in facilities run by Customs and Border Protection or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and were moving through the expedited removal process in a streamlined manner, he said.\n\nThe U.S. response to the end of Title 42 relies heavily on the cooperation of other countries. But some details still need to be worked out.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced on April 27 that it would open regional processing centers in Guatemala and Colombia to “reduce irregular migration and facilitate safe, orderly, humane and lawful pathways from the Americas” to countries such as the United States, Canada and Spain.\n\nBut Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei has complained about a lack of communication between the two governments and has even been calling Republican lawmakers in Congress for their help.\n\nU.S. officials deny any discord with Guatemala over the processing centers and insist that Guatemala has agreed \"in principle\" to help with the processing centers but that questions about implementation need to be resolved.\n\nCongress acts:House passes GOP border security bill as Title 42 expiration looms: What to know\n\nFlorida ruling injects uncertainty on migrant policy\n\nU.S. officials remain concerned about the impact a Florida judge’s ruling last Thursday could have on U.S. immigration policy after Title 42.\n\nU.S. District Judge T. Kent Wetherell in the Northern District of Florida temporarily blocked the Customs and Border Protection from going ahead with a plan to release, or “parole,” some migrants to alleviate overcrowding at immigration holding facilities.\n\nFearing a surge in migrants once Title 42 lifted, Customs and Border Protection said it would parole certain migrants without what's known as a notice to appear, essentially a charging document because those documents take additional time to prepare.\n\nWetherell said a Biden administration memorandum outlining the parole policy appeared to conflict with a decision from the court in a separate case earlier this year.\n\nNuñez-Neto said the administration is concerned about the effect the Florida ruling could have on the time it takes to process migrants.\n\n“Every individual we encounter is thoroughly vetted against our national security and public safety systems,” he said, adding that people are detained if they have outstanding warrants or have any affiliation with terrorism.\n\nThe Biden administration is expected to appeal the ruling.

The families that are part of the expedited process are those who could not be expelled by Title 42, but “do not have a legal basis to stay in the United States.” The administration is also flying certain families that have been expelled into the interior of Mexico to cut down on recidivism.\n\nThe Biden administration has been seeing high numbers of migrants coming to the United States border all year long, drawing criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike.

But this year, the numbers have continued to increase.\n\n\"We are facing a serious challenge at our southern border, and the challenges of course made more acute and more difficult because of the COVID 19 pandemic,\" Mayorkas said. \"It has also been made more difficult because of the fact that the prior administration dismantled our asylum system.\"\n\nMayorkas attributed the increases to the rise of violence, poverty and corruption in countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as well as international assistance to those countries being slashed under the Trump administration.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol said 154,288 of the people coming to the border were \"unique encounters,\" meaning the agency has not encountered them in the past. According to the agency, 27% of the people encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border were from people who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months. The average one-year re-encounter rate between 2014 and 2019 was 14%.\n\nWhile 52% of people encountered at the border were single adults, that number decreased by 6% from June.\n\nIn July, Customs and Border Patrol began an initiative to mitigate repeat migration that refers single adults to prosecution if they have been apprehended and deported under Title 8 in the past.\n\nWhile the number of single adults coming to the United States is decreasing, the number of unaccompanied children saw a nearly 25% increase from June. According to border agency, 18,962 unaccompanied children were encountered at the border, a 24% increase from the 15,234 in June.

Cruise’s character, who is interrogating Nicholson’s character, yells, “I want the truth!” Nicholson shouts back, “You can’t handle the truth!” The scene transcends pop culture.\n\nMore than 30 years later, Nicholson’s quote applies to the border crisis our nation faces. According to a recent NBC News poll, nearly a quarter of Americans still oppose a large-scale border security package, despite the obvious need to do so.\n\nYet, if they knew that nearly 8 million illegal border encounters occurred during President Joe Biden’s first three years in office, and that an additional 1.7 million migrants – known as “gotaways” – have evaded U.S. Border Patrol, they would realize the crisis isn’t merely partisan rhetoric.\n\nNew York cuts services for residents to pay for migrant housing\n\nIf they knew that California now provides taxpayer-funded health care to people who immigrated illegally, and that New York City has cut library and police funding to cover costs for migrant housing, they would realize how reckless this has become.\n\nThese statistics are just some of the facts – shall we say, the truth – about the results of our ongoing border crisis. But it’s not just about statistics. It’s increasingly about the real impact on communities where migrants are going once they are in the United States.\n\nThe border is a mess.Does Biden have the guts to stand up to progressives and get a deal?\n\nIt’s about the daily effects that our broken immigration and asylum systems are having on the entire country. The American taxpayers in cities and states hundreds or thousands of miles away from the border now bear the burden of the Biden administration’s inept leadership on this issue.\n\nThose who condone the Biden administration’s position on border security are not looking at the entire picture. The lack of outrage over the status of our southern and northern borders shows a clear misunderstanding of – or perhaps apathy toward – the problem.\n\nEven President Joe Biden now admits that the southern border is not secure.\n\nDecisions like those in New York and California, while appealing to progressives, ultimately jeopardize the American immigration and asylum systems of both today and tomorrow. These decisions impact all of us.\n\nUS border with Canada is overlooked concern\n\nLast year, I created the Northern Border Security Caucus with nearly 30 House Republicans who also are committed to strengthening border security. Issues at our northern border are unique from those at the southern border, although the concerns are similar. Instead of crossing a river from Mexico into Texas, you can walk into the United States from parts of Canada without knowing it.\n\nI’ve met with officials who tell me the north has become more vulnerable because Border Patrol agents have been transferred to handle the migration surge in the south. The north is largely unsecured and overexposed.\n\nThe result: Northern border encounters increased seven times in FY23 compared with FY21, when President Biden took office and began rolling back Trump-era border regulations. And of the 564 encounters with people on the terror watchlist, 484 were at the northern border.\n\nTo begin solving the border crisis, one of the first measures House Republicans passed last year was House Resolution 2, appropriately named the “Secure The Border Act.” Among its provisions, HR 2 would use physical barriers and technology to curb illegal immigration, increase the number of Border Patrol agents and streamline the asylum process. The bill remains in the Senate for consideration.\n\nWhat immigration strategy?Biden's just shoring up his biggest liability for reelection.\n\nBut lately, President Biden and the White House have communicated some revisionist history, suddenly blaming Congress (particularly Republicans) for not providing him with the funds and tools necessary to secure the border. The president’s blame game sounds like an indirect ask for help securing the border and solving an issue that is plaguing him in the polls.\n\nHere is another truth: Republicans have been publicly ready to work on border security for years. Sure, there may be disagreements about exactly how to solve the problem. But we continue to acknowledge the need for comprehensive border security in the short term, along with immigration reform and asylum reform in the long term.\n\nWe need Democrats to join our efforts.\n\nDemocrats are afraid of returning to Trump-era policies that actually worked all because they don’t like the man himself. But former President Donald Trump’s policies clearly were more effective than those of his successor, which essentially have been to stand by and do nothing while stonewalling state actions through the courts.\n\nOur national security and national sovereignty should not be red issues or blue issues.

Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., found his representation of a border apprehensions statistic misleading.\n\nTo clear up common areas of confusion, we dived into the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico borde, and how the country found itself in this position. Also, what do policies such as asylum and Title 42 look like in practice?\n\nHere's a guide to help you understand the debate:\n\nHow many encounters with migrants did U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have in the last fiscal year at the southern border?\n\nAgents encountered migrants at the southern border about 2,476,000 times in the 2023 fiscal year, from October 2022 through September 2023, according to CBP data.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThat includes people who tried to cross the border more than once. It also includes people who sought out border agents to claim asylum and those who scheduled appointments to claim asylum at official ports of entry.\n\nEncounters include cases in which people are apprehended or detained and then released into the U.S. with a court date, and people who are turned away.\n\nThe peak month was September, when agents encountered migrants nearly 270,000 times.\n\nBut the 2024 fiscal year has topped that. In December, the most recent month with available data, agents had more than 302,000 encounters.\n\nPoor economic conditions, violence and instability in migrants’ home countries often push them to leave, and the appeal of a better life in the U.S. prompts people to embark on dangerous journeys to cross the border.\n\nAnother reason for increased encounters is improved detection efforts by border agencies, according to a report from the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group.\n\n\"As border security improves and becomes more effective, the total number of encounters are likely to rise as well,\" the report said.\n\nHow do last year's encounters at the southern border compare with prior years?\n\nCustoms and Border Protection data shows agents had more encounters in the 2023 fiscal year than in previous years. In 2022, CBP recorded 2,379,000. In 2021, there were 1,735,000.\n\nNow that Title 42 has ended, what happens to asylum-seekers?\n\nUnder the COVID-19-pandemic-era Title 42, most migrants were sent back over the border and denied the right to seek asylum. U.S. officials turned away migrants more than 2.8 million times.\n\nBut there were no real consequences when someone illegally crossed the border. So migrants were able to try repeatedly to cross. A common error is equating encounters with actual people. The more people are turned away, the more this number can balloon as they try a second, third or fourth time.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended Title 42 in May 2023. Now in place is Title 8, a set of long-standing immigration laws in the U.S. Code.\n\nU.S. law states that people have a right to claim asylum if they arrive at a border and express a \"well-grounded fear of persecution.\"\n\nBorder agents briefly screen people who say they fear returning to their home country.\n\n\"If you say, ‘I have a fear of return,’ it triggers a protection under our laws that ensures that a government official will review your case to see if you are likely to be successful with qualifying for asylum in the U.S.,\" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nIf migrants pass the initial screening, their cases go to the immigration court system, which will determine whether they can stay. But that process can take years. Usually, the migrants are released into the U.S. to wait out their cases because Border Patrol stations don't have the capacity to detain everyone.\n\nThese are generally \"defensive asylum\" cases, in which people are placed in removal proceedings and must prove they should stay in the U.S. If they lose their case, they face deportation.\n\nAsylum-seekers with a court date have an incentive to go to their hearings because if they don't show up, they will be ordered deported, Barbato said.\n\nHow long do migrants wait for asylum court hearings?\n\nThe asylum system is massively backlogged, with more than 1.1 million pending cases. Petitioners are waiting an average of nearly four years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n\nBut going through the process is not a sure way to stay in the U.S. About 50% of asylum claims in the last fiscal year were denied, according to TRAC data.\n\nAs they wait for their court dates, asylum seekers can apply for work permits.\n\nWhat is parole and how is it being used?\n\nOne point of debate during border bill negotiations in the Senate was humanitarian parole. That is the president's authority to allow migrants into the U.S. for special cases during emergencies or global unrest. It does not provide a path toward U.S. citizenship.\n\nBiden's administration has relied heavily on humanitarian parole. The U.S. airlifted nearly 80,000 Afghans and brought them to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover. The U.S. has admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainians who fled after the Russian invasion.\n\nLast year, the administration announced a plan to admit 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela via parole, provided those migrants had a financial sponsor and flew to the U.S. instead of going to the U.S.-Mexico border for entry.\n\nAlso being admitted into the U.S. through the parole authority: migrants who make appointments through the CBP One phone app and are processed at official ports of entry.\n\nWhat is the CBP One app?\n\nThe Biden administration wants more people to be processed at these official border crossings instead of crossing unlawfully between ports. So the administration has tried to encourage migrants in Mexico to schedule appointments through the CBP One app.\n\nThere is an incentive for those who use the app and cross lawfully: a fast-track to legal work authorization.\n\nGlitches and challenges with the app are well documented. Many people try every morning to get an appointment in the lottery system. About 1,450 appointment slots are available each day.\n\nCBS News reported that in the app's first year, 450,000 migrants were allowed into the U.S. via the process. Migrants made more than 64.3 million requests to enter the country using the app, the outlet reported.\n\nMigrants who book an appointment have a brief meeting with a border agent. If they pass certain safety checks, they are released into the U.S. with a notice to appear in court at a certain date. They could go through the asylum process later.\n\n\"Most people, after that interview, are allowed to live in the United States, but they are in deportation proceedings. So they receive that Notice to Appear, and they also have to have a sponsor in the U.S.,\" Barbato said.\n\nWhat are 'got-aways,' and how many are entering the U.S.?\n\nSeveral Republican politicians have expressed concern about \"got-aways,\" people who crossed the border into the U.S. without being stopped by border agents.\n\nIt is difficult to know exactly how many people entered without being inspected, but the Department of Homeland Security makes an estimate based on models and observations. For example, an agent might see people in the distance but be unable to reach them, or a sensor or surveillance tool might detect that people are crossing.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office used DHS officials' public statements about got-aways to make its own estimate of 860,000 people in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nRepublicans have argued that people who cross undetected pose a security threat. Laurence Benenson, vice president of policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Forum, agrees that the government can do better at controlling the border, and that it's important to know who is crossing.\n\nBut Benenson also believes that most of the people who cross undetected are coming to the U.S. for the same reasons as those who encounter border agents.\n\n\"They come here for a better life; they come here to escape persecution; they come here to work and be with their families,\" he said.\n\nAdditional material from The Associated Press.\n\nOur sources", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2021/06/09/migrant-encounters-us-mexico-border-decreased-may/7628339002/", "title": "Migrant encounters at U.S.-Mexico border decreased in May", "text": "The number of migrants that U.S. Border Patrol agents encountered along the U.S.-Mexico border in May dropped for the first time in more than a year, according to the enforcement data published Wednesday.\n\nBut the drop in encounters between ports of entry was offset by an increase in the processing of migrants at the official border crossings along the Southwestern U.S. border.\n\nIn all, U.S. officials encountered 180,034 migrants during the month of May, reaching a new peak under President Joe Biden, the newly published statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show. That was a 1% increase compared to April's numbers.\n\nCBP expelled 112,302 migrants last month under an emergency public health rule known as Title 42 that the Biden administration has kept in place. To date, the U.S. has expelled 867,673 migrants under Title 42 since the rule took effect in March 2020.\n\nThe decrease in the number of migrants that Border Patrol encountered last month, although small, is notable. Migrant arrivals at the border had been rising rapidly since they bottomed out last April because of COVID-19 restrictions at the border.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn May, border agents encountered 172,011 migrants in-between the ports of entry, compared to 173,686 in April. That is the first decrease since April 2020.\n\nCBP touted Wednesday other notable decreases as well. The border agency said the arrival of migrant families and unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras dropped for the second straight month.\n\nThat was the case for all migrant families and unaccompanied children from other countries as well. U.S officials encountered a total of 14,168 single children and 44,639 migrants traveling as a family unit. Only the number of single adults continued to increase, statistics showed.\n\nAlthough the number of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border reached the highest point in nearly two decades, Customs and Border Protection said expulsions under Title 42 continued to drive up recidivism rates.\n\nAbout 38% of all migrants that U.S. border officials encountered at the Southwestern border had previously attempted to cross the border at least one other time within the past year, CBP said. That rate is more than double the 15% recidivism rate in the five years prior to the implementation of Title 42.\n\nAs Border Patrol encounters decreased, customs officers experienced in May one of the largest monthly increases in the number of migrant encounters at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOfficers with the Office of Field Operations, the men and women in blue staffing border crossings, encountered 8,023 migrants last month, compared to 5,168 in April. That's the highest number since November 2019.\n\nThe number of migrant encounters at official border crossings had remained low throughout much of 2020 and 2021. The U.S. implemented travel restrictions at ports of entry to curb the spread of COVID-19; they also froze nearly all asylum processing at border crossings.\n\nStarting in April, the Biden administration began allowing the limited processing of certain asylum-seekers under humanitarian exemptions to Title 42 at several ports of entry, including in Nogales.\n\nCBP has been processing up to 35 asylum-seeking families from \"particularly vulnerable\" situations each day at Southwest border crossings as part of negotiations between the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union over the future of Title 42.\n\nLead attorney Lee Gelernt said on Wednesday that the Biden administration had increased the cap to 55 families per day.\n\n\"So roughly 1100 individuals per week across southern border,\" Gelernt said on Twitter.\n\nHave any news tips or story ideas about the U.S.-Mexico border?

They also reflect a broader challenge President Joe Biden faces trying to manage unprecedented numbers of people arriving at the US-Mexico border.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 2.5 million encounters with migrants along the southwest border from October 2022 through September 2023. More than 80% of those encounters occurred between official ports of entry — in remote desert areas or mountains in southeastern San Diego and elsewhere in California, Arizona and Texas.\n\nIn the past six months nearly 100,000 migrants have arrived in the San Diego region, county officials said, though most have moved on to other U.S. cities.\n\nMany of the migrants who arrived over the weekend had been in Border Patrol custody but were released on what the federal government calls “humanitarian parole.” Some were disoriented and unclear about where they were, as they got off buses Saturday and Sunday at the Iris Street trolley station in San Diego. Some weren’t sure if they were still being detained.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThey had no place to charge their cell phones, use bathrooms, eat a meal, or arrange travel to other parts of the United States. Many had received notices to appear in immigration courts in other cities, some they had never heard of and couldn’t pronounce. Others had been separated from family members during the detention process and didn’t know what to do next.\n\n“Where am I?” asked Juan Carlos Ortiz, a 28-year-old from Nicaragua, as he rummaged through his backpack for shoelaces that had been removed from his shoes while in custody. With a shoelace halfway through one shoe, he raced with his group to catch the next trolley heading for the San Diego International airport.\n\nAnother man who spoke Arabic called a friend in Egypt and pressed his phone into a reporter’s hand: “Is my friend still in custody?” asked the man on the phone, half a world away.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said they had no choice but to release the migrants on city streets, because its holding facilities were overcrowded and understaffed. The agency said it was working with local and federal partners to find a solution to the humanitarian challenges at the southern border.\n\nThe welcome center, which opened in October, closed Thursday night because of a lack of funds. Previously it bused people from a federal detention center to a former elementary school in San Diego, where migrants were given basic services, connected with loved ones through translators, and allowed to rest and arrange for the next leg of their journey.\n\nSince October San Diego County has awarded $6 million to SBCS, the nonprofit formerly known as South Bay Community Services, which ran the center. The funds came from what’s left of $650 million the federal government sent San Diego County for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe nonprofit provided transportation, wifi, phone-charging stations, food, travel advice and other services. The group aimed to keep the center open through March, but Thursday was its last day because its “finite resources have been stretched to the limit” amid a significant increase in migrant arrivals, CEO Kathie Lembo said last week.\n\nCounty officials said the center served 700 to 900 people a day last week. In total it provided services to more than 81,000 migrants since October, Lembo said.\n\n“This temporary support was vital and prevented tens of thousands of individuals from being stranded in San Diego without the support needed to continue their journey, as 99.5% of the migrants we served traveled on to destinations outside of the county,” Lembo said in a statement.\n\nWhat newly arrived migrants will do now that the center is closed is unclear.\n\nMigrants who arrived last week came from China, Ecuador, Mexico, Egypt, Nicaragua, Guinea and Georgia.\n\n“If you speak Spanish, please walk down the sidewalk this way,” volunteers shouted as group after group of migrants left the federal buses. “English, over here!” waved another volunteer.\n\nVolunteers from nearly a dozen local and state nonprofits spread out from the Iris trolley station to the San Diego airport, trying to help direct people on the next leg of their trip.\n\n“I’m going to show you a diagram of the trolley’s route. You guys are here at Iris,” volunteer Robert Vivar explained to a group of Spanish-speakers, showing them a map. “Where you’re going to go is where the star is — at the stop called Old Town. That’s where you’re going to get down.”\n\nVolunteers used translation apps on cell phones to try to communicate with those speaking languages other than English, Spanish or French.\n\nIt was the same routine volunteers followed last fall before the migrant welcome center opened.\n\n“It feels like we’re starting from zero again,” said volunteer Patricia Mondragon, who stressed the need for continued government assistance. Mondragon said local or state governments could provide bathrooms, cell charging stations and wifi to help disoriented migrants figure out where they are and where they’re going next.\n\n“We really feel strongly there is a continuous role here for a whole-of-government approach, so we can be the welcoming region that we are known to be. We need to help people in a dignified manner,” Mondragon said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has said California cannot continue providing the same level of humanitarian services along the border it has in the past, not while facing tens of billions in projected budget deficits.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended in June, the state allocated $150 million for sheltering services for migrants. That money is “fully committed” for the year, a spokesman said.\n\nBut Monday Daniel Lopez, the deputy communications director for Newsom’s office, said California will continue “serving as a model of partnership for a safe and humane border.\n\n“The state remains committed to supporting counties as they develop contingency plans to provide sheltering and other essential services for migrants,” he said.\n\nCalifornia funds nonprofit organizations that temporarily house migrants who are separated from family members during the detention process. Lissette Gabelanez, 19 from Ecuador, was in that situation Saturday afternoon as she waited for her mother, father and 4-year-old brother to be released from detention.\n\n“Should I just go back to the detention center,” she asked a volunteer, who told her she was free to make her own decisions but they recommended she wait at the trolley station.\n\n“I’m just very worried about my family,” she told CalMatters.\n\nAt the Old Town trolley station Saturday morning, migrant travelers could take a free shuttle to the airport. But by midday Saturday, airport officials stopped migrants from boarding the free shuttles unless they could show proof that their airline ticket had already been purchased.\n\nA couple from Colombia said they could only purchase their tickets in cash and decided to take a taxi from Old Town to the airport. About a dozen people gathered around a T-mobile booth at the train depot to ask the attendant to charge their phones, as they tried connecting with loved ones to purchase airline tickets. “We’ve been slammed all day,” said the cashier.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Diego airport said migrants should not be arriving at the airport without tickets, or more than eight hours before their flights are scheduled to take off.\n\n“The airport is not set up to provide services,” said Nicole Hall, an airport spokesperson.\n\nSan Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond, a Republican, opposes using county funds to manage the street releases.\n\n“The federal government must manage the mess they’ve created,” he said. “We need the border to be secure and the laws to be upheld, including asylum cases to be heard on a case-by-case basis, not just mass released. But, in the meantime, if the federal government allows this to take place, they must fund the chaos they’ve created.”\n\nSome advocates have raised concerns about how funds at the migrant welcome center were spent and are calling for the county to investigate.\n\nInvoices obtained by CalMatters through a Public Records Act request show that from October through December the organization spent $750,000 on personnel costs, $368,000 on transportation from the border patrol detention center to the welcome center, $461,800 on onward travel for migrants, $151,000 on operating expenses, and $330,000 to subcontractors, among other costs.\n\n“It’s astounding that $6 million dollars have been spent in less than four months’ time and, as a region, we have absolutely no enduring welcoming infrastructure to show for it. This is unacceptable,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, which had volunteers at the trolley station.\n\nToczylowski said her organization will have to “fulfill the mission that has been abandoned by the organization that received all of the county funds.”\n\nFunding transparency is crucial, said Erika Pinheiro, executive director of Al Otro Lado, another nonprofit that sent volunteers last weekend.\n\n“Nothing can be done to get that money back, but we hope it serves as a lesson for the management of future funding so that it’s spent in a way that actually serves the community and focuses resources on the most vulnerable, ” Pinheiro said.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said Friday it would continue to “surge personnel, transportation, processing, and humanitarian resources to the most active and arduous areas throughout San Diego’s border region where migrants are callously placed by smuggling organizations.”\n\nIt added it will coordinate as much as possible with state, local and non-governmental partners, but “this situation is the latest example of the pressing need for Congress to provide additional resources and take legislative action to fix our outdated immigration laws.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}]}

Where to see Arizona wildflowers", "text": "Roger Naylor\n\nSpecial for The Republic\n\nAs far as wildflowers are concerned, a lot of things have gone right so far this winter in Arizona. Widespread rains came early and often. The moisture has been well spaced so there were no extended dry periods. Temperatures have stayed moderate. All those factors matter for how many and what types of flowers are likely to bloom.\n\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to wildflowers, but the 2023 season seems full of promise. The Arizona deserts may be teetering on the edge of a superbloom. It’s still too early to say but no matter how things play out during February, the desert should be filled with a colorful array of poppies, lupines and other flowers this spring.\n\nThis is a wildflower season that should not be missed. Here are seven Arizona wildflower hotspots worth exploring and which blooms you are likely to see.\n\nPretty:Arizona wildflowers are on their way. These are the blooms you're most likely to spot\n\nEstrella Mountain Regional Park\n\nOverview: This big park in Goodyear always seems to get a jump on some of the other spots in the Valley and it flashed lots of blooms in January. Visitors will find a nice medley of brittlebush, Mexican goldpoppies, globemallows, rock daisies and fiddlenecks, among others.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nWhat to look for: Some of the best sightings can be found along the Rainbow Valley Trail sprinkled with poppies, scorpionweed and brittlebush. On the Gadsden Trail, the blue/purple lupines are already blooming and noted for being “extra heavy and extraordinary in color and expanse.” Poppies of varying hues sway on both sides of Flycatcher Trail. Stop at the Nature Center for the exhibits and to get the latest info.\n\nWhen to go: Right now if you want. Abundant blooms should continue through February and into March.\n\nDetails: 14805 W. Vineyard Ave., Goodyear. $7 per vehicle. 602-506-2930, ext. 6; https://www.maricopacountyparks.net.\n\nMore places to see flowers:Try these Arizona hikes and scenic drives this spring\n\nPicacho Peak State Park\n\nOverview: Good to excellent. They’ve had plenty of rain and poppy plants are out in force on the lower slopes of the mountains, although few flowers are visible yet. Joining the poppies will be lupines and a healthy mix of perennials, including some rare globemallows with lilac-hued flowers.\n\nWhat to look for: This is a good park to visit even for folks with limited mobility. Visitors will be able to enjoy plenty of color from the park roadway and adjacent picnic tables. For a closer look, good showings of color can be found on the easy Nature Trail, Children’s Cave Trail and the moderate Calloway Trail.\n\nWhen to go: Mid- to late February. The season often starts early at Picacho Peak, although a late January cold snap could delay it a bit this year. Colorful blooms should continue into March.\n\nPro tip: Picacho Peak is one of the reliably best places to see wildflowers. Expect to share the road into the park and the paths inside with lots of similar-minded visitors. Here's where to keep track of the 2023 wildflower season at all Arizona State Parks.\n\nDetails: 15520 Picacho Peak Road, Picacho. $7 per vehicle. 520-466-3183, https://azstateparks.com/picacho.\n\nBest Scottsdale hikes in spring:McDowell Sonoran Preserve is full of possibilities for flower watchers\n\nLost Dutchman State Park\n\nOverview: Park rangers are cautiously optimistic, predicting an above average year while hoping for a stellar one.\n\nWhat to look for: In some recent years, the poppies at Lost Dutchman have been drastically reduced by late season freezes. So that is always a possibility. Yet even if that does happen, hardier perennials like brittlebush, globemallow and chuparosa should still flourish. If poppies show up to the party, it makes for an unforgettable sight with the steep ramparts of the Superstition Mountains rising directly from a sea of shimmering yellow and orange. For some of the best flower viewing, start up the Siphon Draw Trail, and then circle back on Jacob’s Crosscut and Treasure Loop.\n\nWhen to go: End of February through mid-March.\n\nDetails: 6109 N. Apache Trail, Apache Junction. $7 per vehicle. 480-982-4485, https://azstateparks.com/lost-dutchman.\n\n'We are curators of history':Meet the owners who are preserving Tortilla Flat's Apache Trail heritage\n\nOrgan Pipe Cactus National Monument\n\nOverview: If not a superbloom, something very close to it. Conditions seem pretty close to ideal at this remote park in southwestern Arizona. While poppies will bloom at Organ Pipe, they are not as predominant as at some other locations. Here visitors will enjoy a mixed bouquet of lupines, chuparosa, ocotillos, fairy dusters, brittlebush, globemallows and more.\n\nWhat to look for: In the monument, take the 21-mile Ajo Mountain Drive (a well maintained dirt road), looping into rugged country for a colorful mix of flowers. Or hike the Palo Verde and Victoria Mine trails for a closer look. If the season develops like they expect, rangers may schedule some guided wildflower hikes. Check the website or call the visitor center for details.\n\nWhen to go: March is the prime time. Heading south on State Route 85 from Gila Bend, travelers are treated to big pools of Mexican goldpoppies in good years.\n\nDetails: About 150 miles southwest of Phoenix off SR 85. $25 per vehicle, good for seven days. 520-387-6849, www.nps.gov/orpi.\n\nGet way out:Incredible Arizona hidden-gem destinations that are worth the drive\n\nBartlett Lake\n\nOverview: Good to excellent. After a couple of disappointing years, there are high hopes for a colorful season at Bartlett Lake.\n\nWhat to look for: The road to the reservoir quickly leaves suburbs behind and winds past rolling hills to the sparkling reservoir cradled by mountains. Poppies and lupines grow in profusion on the banks above the water. Be sure to keep an eye peeled for white poppies; this is a good spot for them. Some of the best flower sightings are along the road to Rattlesnake Cove. The Palo Verde Trail parallels the shoreline, pinning hikers between flowers and the lake, a wonderful place to be on a warm March day.\n\nWhen to go: March. Peak color should be in the middle of the month but much will be determined by temperature.\n\nDetails: Bartlett Lake is about 57 miles northwest of Phoenix. An $8 Tonto Day Pass is required. Buy one before you go; purchasing options are listed on the website. 480-595-3300, www.fs.usda.gov/tonto.\n\nArizona 2023 bucket list:Best adventures — and pizza! — to try this year\n\nCatalina State Park\n\nOverview: Good to excellent. All winter the rains have pounded this scenic park on the north side of Tucson. It even led to flooding of the big Cañada del Oro wash in January. All that moisture has greened up the saguaro-clad foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains and the lush garden is thick with flowering plants.\n\nWhat to look for: The Sutherland Trail offers the best assortment of flowers with fields of poppies, cream cups, lupines, penstemon and desert chicory. Best color can be found near the junction with Canyon Loop and continuing for about 2 miles on the Sutherland across the desert.\n\nFor those looking for a quick outing, a good wildflower spot is on the Nature Trail. The path climbs a low hill that’s often carpeted with an array of blooms. Guided hikes and bird walks are offered several days a week.\n\nWhen to go: Mid-March through early April.\n\nDetails: 11570 N. Oracle Road, Tucson. $7 per vehicle. 520-628-5798, https://azstateparks.com/catalina.\n\nBest Tucson hikes:Where to see waterfalls, mountains and a rare crested saguaro cactus\n\nPeridot Mesa\n\nOverview: Moderate to good. This rocky mesa on the San Carlos Apache Reservation east of metro Phoenix is known for some of Arizona’s best poppy displays, stretching across a broad hill and sweeping down the slopes.\n\nWhat to look for: Sharp-eyed visitors will spot lupines, desert chicory and blue dicks mingled among the blaze of orange. But the hillsides blanketed in poppies are the absolute showstopper. With the cooler temperatures this winter, peak bloom isn’t expected until later. The mesa is down a dirt road a short distance off U.S. 70 east of Globe. The road can normally be managed in a passenger car.\n\nWhen to go: Late March into early April.

Patches of bright orange poppies and white lilies dot the hillsides along mountain roads. Blue dicks and purple lupines have popped up along some trails.\n\nAnd it’s only the beginning.\n\nExperts predict this year’s wildflower bloom to peak between now and mid-April. They also expect it to be a particularly good one.\n\n“This is like all the colors on the rainbow and the vibrant green included,” said National Park Service biologist Mark Mendelsohn of the wildflower display.\n\n“It’s a spectacle. It really is,” he said. “It only happens a couple months out of the year and, to this extent, on really good years.”\n\nSuper bloom status? It could be just around the corner.\n\nMore on California's natural beauty:\n\nWhy a super bloom?\n\nAn above-average rain year alone can bring a spectacular bloom throughout Southern California.\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains that stretch over Ventura and Los Angeles counties got hit hard by the Woolsey Fire in November. Then they got doused by rain.\n\nThe combination typically means hillsides painted in orange, red, blue and purple blooms, as the more regular crowd of wildflowers mixes with so-called fire followers.\n\nFrom brightly colored fire poppies to California bells, their seeds can wait underground for decades until their cue to sprout.\n\n“I would get out there now and start looking,” said Joey Algiers, a restoration ecologist with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n\n“I think we’re at the beginnings of a really good wildflower year,” he said.\n\nWhen was the last super bloom?\n\nThe last super bloom happened here two years ago.\n\nAfter five years of drought, the thirsty ground got a boost from a wet December. Then the rain kept coming, not all at once, but a storm or two at a time.\n\nThe spaced-out rainfall gave the soil a chance to soak up water, dry out a bit, and then soak up some more — conditions ideal for wildflowers.\n\nRibbons of white, orange and yellow stretched over the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\nBlooms covered the region from the remote Channel Islands off Ventura to desert parks in San Diego County. Crowds converged on the Antelope Valley Poppy Preserve.\n\nAccording to the latest poppy report for 2019, the Lancaster preserve expects the best blooms to happen in April.\n\nWhere can you find wildflowers?\n\nSo far, in the Santa Monica Mountains, chocolate lilies have been spotted in Rancho Sierra Vista, poppies popped up in upper Cheeseboro and a stretch of grass turned yellow with goldfield flowers just inside the entrance at Paramount Ranch.\n\nIn Malibu Creek State Park, trail-goers can find a little bit of everything. Two weeks ago, Mendelsohn said, he was identifying the plants by leaves. By now, blooms likely have begun putting on a show.\n\n“We strongly recommend people get out there and view them but please don’t collect,” said Mendelsohn, also with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n\nPark officials also reminded folks that wildflowers also are best viewed trail-side.\n\nHeading off-trail can be particularly damaging in recent burn areas, where vegetation has just started its often years-long recovery, and can be a safety issue.\n\nBefore areas reopened, only the trails were cleared of hazards. Off-trail areas may have falling rocks and branches or hidden holes created when root systems were destroyed in the fire.\n\nIt also takes a big toll on the wildflowers, including those less-common fire followers. If they get picked or trampled, their seeds may be lost and they may not come back again, Algiers said.\n\nWant to test your wildflower IQ?

Sargassum rots after it washes ashore and produces hydrogen sulfide gas, which smells like rotten eggs and can irritate your eyes, nose and throat.\n\nUSA TODAY reports: 2023 could be big year for Sargassum.\n\nThe seaweed has existed for centuries, but climate change and inflows of nitrogen and man-made fertilizer from rivers have caused exponential growth over the past decade.\n\nLarge amounts of Sargassum are projected to hit the Gulf Coast shores, including Florida, this summer. Though the \"seaweed season\" is March through October, it started appearing ahead of schedule in the Key West area and in Cancun, Mexico.\n\nWhere does Sargassum come from?\n\nSources vary on where the seaweed comes from. A U.N. environmental agency says Sargassum originates in the 2-million-square-mile Sargasso Sea. Ocean currents carry it to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean islands, where the sheer amount of it hurts tourism and the fishing industry.\n\nHowever, the Sargasso Sea Commission says Sargassum on the eastern U.S., Western Africa and the Caribbean comes from a region south of the Sargasso Sea between the north equatorial current and the equator. Studies say that Sargassum found in the two regions are distinctly different, the commission says.\n\nOn the eastern Atlantic, the seaweed bloom near Florida and Mexico is considered one of the largest in history.\n\nUSA TODAY reported that more than 24 million tons of Sargassum blanketed the Atlantic in June 2022, up from 18.8 million tons in May, according to a report by the University of South Florida's Optical Oceanography Lab.\n\nThat report called the amount \"a new historical record.\"\n\nWhat is Sargassum?\n\nSargassum is a species of large brown seaweed, a type of macroalgae that floats in large masses. The Atlantic Sargassum belt reaches from the west coast of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico and can be viewed from orbit.\n\nIn 2018, NASA satellites photographed an estimated 20 million tons of Sargassum that stretched 5,500 miles across the Atlantic Ocean. The weight was more than 200 fully loaded aircraft carriers, NASA said.\n\nUp close, Sargassum is a collection of leafy structures, branches, and oxygen-carrying berries called pneumatocysts, air bladders that help the mats float.\n\nIs Sargassum dangerous to humans?\n\nIn the water, Sargassum is considered harmless to people.\n\nOn land, Sargassum begins to rot and produces smelly hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which can irritate eyes, ears, and noses. People with asthma or other breathing illnesses may have trouble breathing if they inhale too much of it.\n\nIn open areas like beaches, however, moving air usually dilutes the gas to non-harmful levels.\n\nThe seaweed also contains tiny sea creatures, such as jellyfish larvae, that can irritate your skin on contact.\n\nAnd don't use Sargassum in cooking, Florida officials advise. It may contain amounts of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.\n\nHow long has Sargassum been around?\n\nSargassum has existed for hundreds of years. Christopher Columbus encountered it in 1492 and named the Sargasso Sea after the seaweed.\n\nHistorically, small amounts of Sargassum have washed ashore with other beach wrack material such as sea grass, sponges and soft corals. Beach wrack helps stabilize shorelines and feeds dune plants.\n\nBut Sargassum began attracting international notice in 2011 when it started washing up on Caribbean islands in much larger amounts. The trend has continued nearly every year since then in varying amounts, threatening tourism in some seaside communities.\n\nWhat's driving the increase in Sargassum?\n\nClimate change is considered a key factor. Sargassum thrives in warm water. A report by Florida International University also cites:\n\nDust clouds from the Sahara: The clouds contain iron, nitrogen and phosphorus that fertilize seaweed and plankton and extend for thousands of miles over the Atlantic.\n\nThe clouds contain iron, nitrogen and phosphorus that fertilize seaweed and plankton and extend for thousands of miles over the Atlantic. More nitrogen: The Amazon and Mississippi rivers send large amounts of runoff fertilizer from farms and ranches into the ocean, which also feed the seaweed.\n\nUnlike most other seaweeds, which begin growing on the seafloor, Sargassum is holopelagic, which means it reproduces while floating on water.\n\nDoes Sargassum have any benefit?\n\nSargassum is classified as an Essential Fish Habitat by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That gives the seaweed special protections, including how it is collected. It can't be removed directly from water – it has to wash up on shore first.\n\nSargassum provides a source of food to a variety of marine wildlife, including birds, turtles, fish, and crabs, according to the Virgin Islands Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nGreen sea turtles use Sargassum mats as nurseries and loggerhead sea turtles use the seaweed to stay near the ocean surface, according to the Sea Turtle Preservation Society. Shrimp, crabs and fish also use it as a habitat.\n\n________\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; sargassummonitoring.com; University of Florida Water Institute; Associated Press; Florida International University", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2022/02/10/georgia-statefloral-distributors-have-florists-covered-valentines-day-mothers-day/6685452001/", "title": "Georgia State Floral Distributors are prepared for Valentine's Day", "text": "The National Retail Federation estimates that around one-third of Americans will be buying flowers for Valentine's Day, which is why Georgia State Floral Distributors is hard at work right now.\n\nOwner Cecil \"Len\" Collins Jr. said holidays like this are \"all hands on deck\" situations because they produce four-to-five times the business they normally get.\n\nThe company, based in Augusta and Savannah, supplies many of the retail florists within a 100-mile radius of each city. Collins and his customers take pride in the high-quality standard of Georgia State's flowers.\n\n\"Like fruit is different grades, we're up there buying the best grade,\" he said. \"Plus, it's all in the care and handling, stressing what we use with the fertilizers and having the right temperature.\"\n\nBrent Slagle of Flowers on Broad in Augusta has always admired the freshness of their product and the size of the blooms, saying \"You can always depend on their quality.\"\n\nThe Collins' distributors cultivate blossoms from growers across the globe and store them in their refrigeration unit. The vast and varied supply of flowers give the unassuming fridge a rainbow of colors and bouquet of scents.\n\nMichele Mikulec, owner of the Madame Chrysanthemum florist shop in Savannah, said via Messenger that she buys about 75% of her supplies from Georgia State because of their great variety.\n\nAnd she doesn't only have to select real flowers. The distributors also offer a huge stock of vases and arrangement tools as well as beautiful flowers that are inorganic, or as the Collins Family calls them \"botanically incorrect.\"\n\n\"Our customers tell us what to stock,\" Len said. \"We listen to them.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed reaction to the flower business. When hospitals increased safety restrictions, some revenue was lost because arrangements could not be brought to patients' rooms. But, Georgia State saw a bump for celebratory events like birthdays and anniversaries.\n\n\"With limited social gatherings, flowers filled the void,\" he said. \"Flowers are personal, God's creation and elicit emotion.\"\n\nThey are particularly personal for Len as his father, Cecil Sr., started the business in 1954 with uncles Bonnie and Frank. Bonnie had a wholesale flower business in Macon, while Cecil was a county agent.\n\n\"My uncle said, 'Hey, they're opening the Savannah River Site in Augusta. I think it's gonna be big,'\" Len said. \"So, he set my dad up here, closed his Macon store and moved up here to help my dad.\"\n\nFrank provided the seed money and the brothers set up shop in a 1,600-square-foot facility on downtown Augusta's Ninth Street. Since then, they've moved to a 38,000-square-foot site on Marvin Griffin Road and added another location in Savannah. As time passed, modern technology has also been a huge help.\n\n\"We used to get stuff in off of trains, have to go meet at the bus station to get flowers. Now it's refrigerated trucks, so we're getting it faster and it's in better condition,\" Len said. \"People are getting more for their money.\"\n\nIt also continues to be a family business. Len's son, Trevor, works in sales, but has worked with the business since he was a teenager.\n\n\"I remember being in middle school, sixth or seventh grade, him getting me up, dragging me out of bed at 6 in the morning to work in the summer,\" Trevor recalled with a laugh. \"Being in the warehouse with an old price gun, getting all the silk bushes and everything priced and ready to go.\"\n\n\"It was the same way with me,\" Len said. \"As soon as I could hold a broom.\"\n\nSo what's next?\n\nLen said they hope to continue to do more of what they do now, including supporting local florists. He encourages residents to shop directly from area vendors, rather than using third-party websites, so the florists can receive as much support as possible.\n\nCustomers like Jean Phelps of The Bloom Closet Florist in Martinez said she appreciates that kind of philanthropic attitude.\n\n\"I had to have emergency surgery Mother's Day week and they sold all my flowers I had pre-ordered so I wouldn't be out all the money,\" Phelps said via Messenger. \"They didn't have to do that, that's who they are though.\"\n\nThe Augusta location is just off Doug Barnard Parkway.

A wet winter produced a bounty of spring blooms across the Arizona desert unlike anything seen for quite a while.\n\nSuperbloom years are extremely rare so its unlikely we would have them in back-to-back springs. Yet we may be poised to beat the odds. Early indications point to another excellent year for wildflowers. And nothing could make me happier.\n\nMy Facebook and Twitter feeds from late winter into spring are almost solid wildflowers. I am obsessed with desert blooms and make no apologies for it. There is magic in these ethereal beauties. They are ground-level fireworks, a spill of neon and a fleetingly joyous welcome mat in these arid lands.\n\nOne of the great pleasures of being a desert dweller is spending a 70-degree winter day standing amid a field of golden poppies.

They’ll die soon after being plucked and won’t have a chance to spread seeds. Leave them for others to enjoy.\n\nSecond, stay on trails and watch where you step. There could be small seedlings all around. Do not trample the flowers by wading into a field — thus ruining them for everyone — just so you can snag a selfie.\n\nLOOK OUT FOR SNAKES:It's rattlesnake season. Here's how to stay safe\n\nStaying on the path is also a safety issue. I hiked more than 800 miles of Arizona trails last year and saw a total of three rattlesnakes. All were in March, while I was on wildflower hikes. This is the season snakes are most active. Stay on a clear path where you can see around your feet. Start wading into the greenery or climbing over boulders and you make yourself more vulnerable.\n\nNow, here are some of the best places to see spring wildflowers throughout metro Phoenix.\n\nWhite Tank Mountain Regional Park\n\nFarmlands in the West Valley come to an abrupt end, breaking against the wall of White Tank Mountain Regional Park. Flowers got an early start early in this 30,000-acre park. Poppies, desert lavender, lupines, wild geraniums, buckwheat, fleabane and combseed are already in bloom. Rangers predict an early and abundant season so you may want to make this one of your first stops. The best locations will vary week to week. Goat Camp, Mesquite and Mule Deer are all good flower trails.\n\nDetails: 20304 W.

Visitors will find a nice medley of brittlebush, Mexican goldpoppies, globemallows, rock daisies and fiddlenecks. Some of the best sightings can be found along the first 2 miles of the Rainbow Valley Trail. Look for swaths of color along the Quail and Gadsden trails as well.

Try the easy Bajada Trail, which parallels San Juan Road at the base of the Gila Range. It’s known for carpets of poppies and the small-blossomed bladderpod after wet winters. Another option is climbing the north face of South Mountain on the Ranger Trail, where the slopes are often streaked with an assortment of flowers.\n\nDetails: 10919 S. Central Ave., Phoenix.

Poppies, primrose, lupines, rock daisies, fairy duster and the flame-orange tips of ocotillo add drama to mountains that already exhibit plenty on their own. The Userys gain enough elevation to afford tremendous views back toward Phoenix and farther east to the rolling waves of the Goldfield and Superstition mountains.

Add flowers to the mix and that’s a great way to spend a day. At Lake Pleasant Regional Park, the heaviest concentration of poppies can be found on Pipeline Canyon Trail, especially from the southern trailhead to the floating bridge a half-mile away. The bridge is guarded by some extremely robust globemallows the size of landscape shrubs. A nice assortment of blooms also lines the Beardsley, Wild Burro and Cottonwood trails.

The lake will then be closed to fishing until 6 a.m. March 2 to allow the fish time to disperse and acclimate to their new surroundings. The trout season, which opened Nov. 1, will continue through April 15.\n\nLast fall’s trout stocking saw fish weighing up to 7 pounds being loaded into the lake.\n\nThe parks and recreation department stocks the lake in partnership with the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism as part of the Communities Fisheries Assistance Program.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“We are proud to continue this partnership with KDWPT to enhance the fishing experience for the residents and visitors of Shawnee County,” said John Boyd, Shawnee County Parks and Recreation planning and development director, in a news release.\n\nFor those who've never caught a trout before, they may be surprised at just how slippery they are to hold onto. Trout are covered in a protective slime coating that helps prevent them from getting sick. Anglers are often told to wet their hands before handling a trout to keep the membrane from coming off if they are going to catch and release fish.\n\nTypical bait and lures used to catch rainbow trout include trout dough, corn, minnows, salmon eggs, worms, Vibric Rooster Tails, Little Cleos, spinners and Yakima Mag Lips. Trout also have keen eyesight, which means anglers should use light lines when seeking trout. Fly fishing also is a popular method of targeting trout, especially when water temperatures get warmer.\n\nTrout typically are found in shallow waters, running in schools near the banks or near the surface over deeper waters. They prefer cooler water, ideally 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit. When water temps reach 65 and higher, trout typically stop feeding and many die off or head to deep, cooler waters as it continues to heat up into the 70s and 80s.\n\nRainbow trout in the wild generally run smaller in size than some of their salmonid brethren, such as the lake trout and Chinook salmon. They are bigger than many other species, however, such as the grayling, sockeye salmon, golden trout and whitefish, and can reach up to 45 pounds or more. The state record rainbow trout weighed 15.72 pounds and was caught by Spring Hill resident Josh McCullough at Kill Creek Park Lake in 2014, though Lake Shawnee has produced some record trout in years past.\n\nThe daily creel limit in Kansas is five trout per day, with a possession limit of 15.\n\nAll state licensing and permit requirements apply to fishing at Lake Shawnee and Ward-Martin Creek, which also is stocked, and anglers must have a state trout permit to fish for trout. The permit costs $14.50 and can be purchased online through the KDWPT’s website at http://www.ksoutdoors.com/. Licenses last 365 days from the date of purchase, meaning those who purchased a trout permit in the fall will not need to buy one this spring.\n\nThe county's trout stocking program was started in 1979 by Ted Ensley, former Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Commission secretary and Shawnee County Parks and Rec director, after game warden Bill Burlew came to him with the idea.\n\n“He and I got to talking one day and he said, ‘Well, I think this kind of a program would go good here,’ and I kinda looked at him and I said, ‘I don’t think so,’ ” Ensley said in a 2017 interview with The Topeka Capital-Journal. “But anyway, we had that conversation over the period of a couple of weeks or whatever and I said, ‘I’m going to bring that to the board of the county commission,’ and they said yes, so that was the genesis of the program.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/23/storm-brings-snow-rain-and-blizzard-warning-for-ventura-county/69937965007/", "title": "Storm brings snow, rain and blizzard warning for Ventura County", "text": "The coldest storm so far this season brought snow, rain and freezing temperatures to Southern California this week.

Snow levels will be lowest on Tuesday and Wednesday, forecasts indicate.\n\nGrapevine closed into Sunday afternoon\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officials from the Fort Tejon office said ice buildup will keep the Grapevine closed through Sunday morning.\n\nThey hope to open the route sometime Sunday afternoon.\n\nSunday morning Grapevine status\n\nAs of 6:30 a.m. Sunday, the Grapevine section of I-5 remained shut by snow and ice, among other routes, Caltrans reported.\n\nFor Ventura County travelers considering heading north to reach Interstate 5, Highway 166 north of Santa Maria, which connects Highway 101 to the 5, also remained shut Sunday morning, according to Caltrans road information.\n\nHighway 33 north of Ojai remains closed through Los Padres National Forest as it has been since early January storms damaged the route.\n\nChilly night ahead\n\nWith most rain and snow in the rear view Saturday night, the exiting storm system will still leave its chilly fingerprint behind.\n\nOvernight lows Saturday into Sunday are expected to dip toward 40 degrees or the high 30s in Ventura County's coastal areas, said Rose Schoenfeld, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nFurther inland, temps will droop to near freezing in the Fillmore and Piru areas, with lows in the mid-30s, she said.\n\nMoorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks could see lows in the high 30s.\n\nA chance of showers continues along with more sprinklings of snow in mountain areas.\n\nIn the Grapevine area, temperatures are forecast to stay below freezing overnight, keeping existing snow on the ground in place, Schoenfeld said.\n\nThe accumulated snow, coupled with the possibility of more snowfall and fewer winter-weather resources than areas where snow is commonplace have all contributed to the Grapevine's overnight closure, she said.\n\nSnow to keep Grapevine closed overnight Saturday\n\nThe tail end of a cold storm will keep Interstate 5 along Tejon Pass closed overnight, Caltrans officials announced Saturday evening.\n\nThe mountainous corridor that connects Ventura and Los Angeles counties to the Central Valley — the so-called Grapevine — remained impacted by snow, with more snowfall expected, the state traffic agency said.\n\nOfficials had no estimate for when the route might open.\n\nGrapevine...still closed\n\nSnow kept the Grapevine close as of 5 p.m. Saturday, Caltrans officials said.\n\nHighway 166 north of Santa Maria, which connects Highway 101 and Interstate 5 and serves as a detour when the Grapevine is shut, also remained closed.\n\nSome other regional routes, including Highway 14 in the Santa Clarita area, had reopened.\n\nTopanga Canyon Boulevard had also reopened after a mudslide closed it earlier Saturday, the state traffic agency reported.\n\nSnow-capped peaks in the 805 proved too powerful a draw to keep motorists away, reporter John Palminteri noted when tweeting photos of cars jamming Gibraltar Road in Santa Barbara County despite \"road closed\" signs and barriers.\n\nMud closes Topanga Canyon Blvd.\n\nCaltrans officials said early Saturday afternoon a mudslide had closed Topanga Canyon Boulevard from Pacific Coast Highway to Grand View Drive, blocking a route inland from PCH east of Malibu.\n\nGrapevine snow continues\n\nSnow continues to block the Grapevine, Caltrans officials said shortly after noon on Saturday.\n\nRegional four-day snowfall totals as of 10 a.m. Saturday showed Mount Wilson, elevation 5,700 feet, getting 35 feet of snow, that National Weather Service reported. Frazier Park had 23 feet.\n\nEstimates for Ventura County mountains weren't immediately available.\n\nRainfall totals\n\nThe storm's heaviest rain had passed through Ventura County by Saturday morning, said meteorologist Rich Thompson of the National Weather Service, although showers could linger. Thunderstorms and bouts of heavy rain were still possible.\n\nHere are some four-day rainfall totals for Ventura County as of 10:20 a.m. Saturday, per the weather service:\n\nMatilija Dam, 10.67 inches\n\nWestlake Village, 6.25\n\nThousand Oaks, 5.82\n\nPiru, 4.87\n\nFillmore, 3.72\n\nSanta Paula, 3.69\n\nSaticoy, 3.4\n\nCSU Channel Islands, 3.31\n\nLa Conchita, 3.13\n\nMoorpark, 3.05\n\nSimi Valley, 3.02\n\nOxnard Civic Center, 2.87\n\nVentura, 2.8\n\nOjai, 2.15\n\nCamarillo Airport, 2.14\n\nSunday should be mostly clear before more rain arrives Monday through Wednesday, Thompson said, but the incoming storm won't be as powerful.\n\nFrozen things from the sky\n\nHail and graupel reports in the east county popped on up Twitter late Saturday morning, including at the California Highway Patrol office in Moorpark.\n\nAnd hat tip to ReporterDawn, formerly of the Star and the Acorn, for meteorological acumen while sharing graupel in Agoura.\n\nHelicopter view\n\nVentura County's Aviation Unit posted videos of recent activity involving helicopter crews.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Copter 9 flew over Matilija Dam as the crew surveyed rivers and roads:\n\nOvernight, a county helicopter helped search from above when RVs in the Valencia area were washed into a river:\n\nSnow and ice cover Grapevine\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's office at Fort Tejon tweeted photos of the Grapevine Saturday morning covered with snow and ice.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., officials had no estimated time for the mountainous Interstate 5 corridor to reopen.\n\nEvacuation warnings assessed\n\nPatrick Maynard, who directs Ventura County's Office of Emergency Services, said Saturday morning he had reviewed the status of the county's evacuation warnings initially issued Thursday.\n\nMaynard provided an update shortly before 9 a.m.:\n\nCamp Chaffee near Casitas Vista Road: Will remain under an evacuation warning until 3 p.m. Saturday to allow time for the creek to recede.\n\nCreek Road/Old Creek outside Ojai: Evacuation will be lifted at 9 a.m. Some mud and debris remains in the roadway in both areas; however, nothing hazardous is present.\n\nMatilija Canyon Road: The road remains impassable due to water flow but debris looks minimal compared to January's storms. A helicopter copter will launch around 9 a.m. to do an aerial recon of the area so officials can further evaluate the status of the roadway. The area will remain under an evacuation warning until further notice.\n\nThe bulk of the rain system had made its way through Ventura County as of Saturday morning, Maynard said. Officials expect isolated showers, windy conditions and possibly a thunderstorm over the next 18 hours.\n\nNo significant threat of issues remain, he said. More information is available at the emergency services website at vcemergency.com.\n\nGrapevine closed\n\nSnow again closed the Grapevine early Saturday, the California Highway Patrol and Caltrans reported.\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m., there was no estimated duration.\n\nMotorists had been advised to use Highway 101 as an alternate route since Highway 114 in Santa Clarita was closed by snow, Caltrans said around 7:45 a.m., and highways 58 and 138 were also closed.\n\nHighway 166 north of Santa Maria, which closed Friday, also remained closed as of Saturday morning, closing off a route from Highway 101 to Interstate 5.\n\nSuch closures often slow Highway 101 in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties as more vehicles, including big rigs, use the coastal corridor.\n\nVentura River flood warning\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of flooding on the Ventura River as of about 12:15 a.m. Saturday, with the warning lasting until 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMeasurements taken near Foster Park showed a crest near 19 feet, with possible impacts on Highway 101 near downtown Ventura.\n\nWater rescue near Ojai\n\nFirefighters responded to a rescue near Ladera Road northeast of Ojai city limits around 10:35 p.m. Friday, where people were said to be stuck in a vehicle.\n\nA sheriff's helicopter had been called in but was cancelled, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. William Hutton.\n\nUltimately, a helicopter and rescue swimmer did rescue a driver from the vehicle, the Ventura County Fire Department reported.\n\nSeparately, shortly before midnight California Highway Patrol officials had requested a closure of Highway 150 from west of Santa Ana Road, near Lake Casitas, to Gobernador Canyon Road near Carpinteria.\n\nWater-rescue crews called out in Ventura\n\nFirefighters responded to a water rescue along the Ventura River around 10:15 p.m. , staging near Main and Peking streets in Ventura.\n\nRadio traffic from the scene indicated two people were stuck on an island south of the bridge. They did not appear to be immediately at risk from the water.\n\nThunderstorm warning includes Simi, TO\n\nStorm activity continued in the east county as of 10 p.m. Friday, with the National Weather Service issuing a severe thunderstorm warning until 10:45 p.m.\n\nTrees downed around Thousand Oaks\n\nAround 9 p.m. Friday, authorities responded to a number of downed trees and minor crashes in Thousand Oaks.\n\nA car crashed into a downed tree at Lynn Road and Avenida de los Arboles shortly before 9 p.m. The driver suffered minor injuries and did not need to be taken to the hospital, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. William Hutton.\n\n\"There are just a lot of downed trees calls,\" he said. The sheriff's office is contracted with Thousand Oaks for police services.\n\nAfter 9:30 p.m., four homes in the 200 block of Yellowstone Avenue in Thousand Oaks were evacuated after a tree fell and caused a gas leak, according to authorities. Few additional details were available.\n\nTrees, rocks, mud impact roads around county\n\nEmergency responders were busy Friday night as reports of flooded roads, fallen trees, downed power lines, rocks and mud impacted streets and highways around Ventura County.\n\nSome callers also reported flooding inside homes and other issues.\n\nSome incidents as of 9 p.m. included:\n\nA vehicle stuck in mud on southbound Highway 101 near Seacliff, with traffic slow along the corridor.\n\nRocks, a tree and power lines blocking lanes of Highway 150 west of Lake Casitas, between the lake and Carpinteria.\n\nA vehicle in floodwater on Highway 150 near Santa Ana Road, as Coyote Creek waters rose. A man was reportedly rescued from the vehicle.\n\nFallen trees and other issues were also reported on local streets and neighborhoods.\n\nWeak tornado watch issued for Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme\n\nAn alert of a weak tornado has been issued for Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme until 9 p.m., the National Weather Service said.\n\nA weak tornado, also known as a waterspout, could cause minor damage with spinning winds of up to 50 to 60 mph, said Joe Sirard, meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nMore Ventura County areas added to flood watch list\n\nMore Ventura County areas were added to the flood watch list, which is set to expire at 10 p.m., according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nAreas include:\n\nVentura and Ventura Harbor\n\nOxnard\n\nCamarillo\n\nPort Hueneme\n\nNewbury Park\n\nPoint Mugu\n\nPoint Mugu State Park\n\nWestlake Village\n\nAgoura Hills\n\nMinor flooding is ongoing or expected in these areas, according to the weather service. Minor flooding is possible along creeks and small streams, including Conejo Creek downstream of Highway 101 near Camarillo.\n\nThe rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable of local damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn scars, according to the weather service.\n\nLatest rain and snow totals\n\nFrazier Park has seen 13 inches of snow pile up over the last three days, 5 inches of which fell between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Friday, according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nNo updates were given for:\n\nMount Pinos: 12 inches\n\nMountain High: 16 inches\n\nPine Mountain Club: 6 inches\n\nLockwood Valley: 10 inches\n\nIn a tweet, the weather service said it expected snow to return to lower elevations after 10 p.m. Friday and warned drivers to avoid the recently-opened Tejon Pass.\n\nHere are preliminary rainfall totals over the last three days from the National Weather Service as of 4 p.m. Friday. The totals may be misrepresented because of snowfall, according to the weather service.\n\nAgoura Hills: 3.03 inches\n\nAnacapa Island: .99 of an inch\n\nCamarillo: 1.03 inches\n\nCSU Channel Islands 1.65 inches\n\nFillmore: 1.77 inches\n\nLa Conchita: 1.06 inches\n\nMoorpark: 1.33 inches\n\nNewbury Park: 2.18 inches\n\nOjai: 1.89 inches\n\nOxnard (National Weather Service location): 1.45 inches\n\nPiru: 1.57 inches\n\nPort Hueneme: .44 of an inch\n\nRocky Peak: 2.24 inches\n\nSanta Paula: 1.88 inches\n\nSaticoy: 1.61 inches\n\nSimi Valley: .88 of an inch\n\nThousand Oaks: 2.40 inches\n\nVentura: 1.20 inches\n\nWestlake Village 2.44 inches\n\nCHP escorting traffic on Grapevine\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol units from the Fort Tejon and Newhall areas are escorting vehicles through the Grapevine in both directions.\n\nThe Grapevine has reopened but one lane in each direction is closed, said Caltrans spokeswoman Allison Colburn.\n\nRoad conditions on the Tejon Pass on Interstate 5 will remain very wet through the night, according to the CHP Fort Tejon Twitter account, and motorists are advised to not pass the CHP officers conducting the escorts.\n\nCrews are continuing the monitor the roadway for changing weather and conditions and motorists are asked to drive cautiously, according to the Caltrans District 7 Twitter account.\n\nHighway 166 between Highway 101 in Santa Maria and Highway 33 near Taft remains closed.\n\n'In like a lamb'\n\nFebruary came in like a lamb after January storms drenched Ventura County and much of the state.\n\nBut it's going out like a lion, climatologist William Patzert said of Friday’s storm.\n\nIn much of Ventura County, average February rainfall is under 4 inches.\n\n“I expect us to smash that here in the next couple of days and early next week,” said Patzert, formerly at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.\n\nAfter a little break on Sunday, the rain is expected to return Monday and Tuesday.\n\nCaltrans closes part of Highway 166 after mudslides, flooding\n\nState authorities closed Highway 166 between Highway 101 in Santa Maria and Highway 33 near Taft around noon Friday, according to California Highway Patrol records.\n\nThe closure locked down 65 miles of the road that connects Highway 101 to Interstate 5 after flooding and mudslides covered parts of the road, said Alexa Bertola, a spokeswoman for California Department of Transportation District 5.\n\nBertola said the department had no estimate for when the highway would reopen.\n\nWith the Grapevine closed over Tejon Pass on Interstate 5, Highway 166 typically provides a detour for northbound motorists from Ventura, Santa Barbara and LA counties as a connection between the 101 and the 5. Southbound motorists on the 5 likewise use the 166 as a detour.\n\nClosure of both freeways can sometimes snarl roads in the region if drivers get backed up for extended periods.\n\nFlash flood warning issued for parts of Ventura County\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning to parts of Ventura County including Ojai, Fillmore and Simi Valley through 10 p.m. Friday.\n\nHeavy rain will likely continue through much of Friday with additional rainfall of 2 to 5 inches possible, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service.\n\nTow truck drivers roaming until 7 p.m.\n\nThe Ventura County Transportation Commission's freeway service patrol will navigate highways 101 and 118 without a break in service Friday because of the storm.\n\nTow truck drivers are roaming certain segments of the highways looking for stranded motorists until 7 p.m., according to a VCTC Tweet.\n\nTow truck drivers will change flat tires, provide a gallon of fuel and tow vehicles to a safe location off the freeway where motorists can arrange for additional assistance, according to the VCTC website.\n\nAuthorities warn of possible tornado\n\nOn Friday morning, authorities warned of a possible tornado in northern Santa Barbara County.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it had no confirmation that a tornado had formed. But its radar readings showed a supercell thunderstorm off the coast had moved to shore, prompting the warning.\n\nOnce it moved ashore, it dissipated quickly, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nHeavy rain still to come\n\nAround 1 p.m. Friday, heavy rain was falling around Ojai and farther north. But elsewhere in Ventura County, many areas had lighter or more moderate rainfall.\n\nThat's because some of the heaviest rain had stalled over Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, said Ryan Kittell, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. The band over Santa Barbara is expected to move in Ventura County later Friday afternoon or evening, he said.\n\nWhen that happens, the county will experience the brunt of the \"very cold\" storm. By Friday evening, periods of intense rain could reach half an inch to an inch an hour.\n\n\"We do expect quite a bit of flooding over the roads developing, if not earlier, certainly by tonight,\" Kittell said.\n\nLockwood Valley roads close\n\nClose to 2 feet of snow had piled up in Lockwood Valley by noon Friday and even more blanketed the nearby mountains.\n\nGusty winds came in waves throughout the day and the snow continued to fall, said Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Vulich at a station off Lockwood Valley Road in the Los Padres National Forest.\n\n“Pretty much every road is closed,” he said. “The road crews are working on Lockwood Valley Road between Frazier Mountain and Chico Larson Road.\"\n\nVulich said he had not had any reports of significant damage. The road closure had kept people safe and off the roads for now. But he expected to see a lot of folks come up on Sunday to check out the snow after the storm had passed.\n\nSnow blankets Mount Pinos\n\nThe National Weather Service reported three-day snowfall totals as of 11 a.m. Friday for these Ventura County spots.\n\nMount Pinos: 12 inches\n\nMountain High: 16 inches\n\nPine Mountain Club: 6 inches\n\nLockwood Valley: 10 inches\n\nFrazier Park: 8 inches\n\nSee the storm sweeping through county\n\nCounty reports rainfall totals\n\nHere are rainfall totals from the last 24 hours as of 9 a.m. Friday. The preliminary figures were reported by the Ventura County Watershed Protection District.\n\nCamarillo: .71 of an inch\n\nFillmore: .9 of an inch\n\nMatilija Canyon: 2.94 inches\n\nMoorpark: .83 of an inch\n\nOjai: 1.62 inches\n\nOxnard: .91 of an inch\n\nPort Hueneme: .44 of an inch\n\nSanta Paula: 1.06 inches\n\nSimi Valley: .88 of an inch\n\nThousand Oaks: .66 of an inch\n\nVentura: .76 of an inch\n\nA snow-covered Grapevine\n\nSnow blanketed the Grapevine on Friday morning. The interstate remained closed with no estimated time for reopening, according to a tweet from the California Highway Patrol.\n\nCaltrans is working hard on clearing the snow and ice from the roadway, the CHP said.\n\nCrews patrolling hot spots\n\nSnowfall at lower elevations reduced the amount of rainfall early on in the multi-day storm. But as the snow shifts to higher elevations, more rain could cause problems on local roads.\n\n“We’re just watching hour by hour,” Dave Fleisch, the county's assistant public works director, said Friday morning.\n\nThe agency had trucks patrolling throughout the county, particularly in areas that typically flood and those damaged in January storms, he said. The hot spots include Matilija Canyon north of Ojai as well as Camp Chaffee and Nye roads in the Ojai Valley.\n\nState Highway 33 and Matilija Canyon Road took some of the biggest hits last month. Parts of the roads washed out, and others were buried in mud and rocks.\n\nAuthorities report no major issues\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Office of Emergency Services reported no major storm-related problems by 9 a.m. Friday.\n\nBut it is early, OES Director Patrick Maynard said. The storm appears to be shaping up to dump much of the heavier rain on the county Friday afternoon, likely between 3 and 7 p.m., Maynard said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, much of the county recorded below an inch of rainfall. Matilija Canyon above Ojai received just over 3 inches of rain and spots along the Highway 33 corridor ranged from 1 1/2 and 2 inches.\n\nIntense downpours to hit Ventura County\n\nIntense downpours and isolated thunderstorms were shifting toward southern Ventura County and southeast Santa Barbara around 8:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nVery heavy rain, road flooding, small hail and gusty winds were possible, the National Weather Service said. The agency also cautioned that ocean waterspouts and land-based tornadoes were possible through noon Friday.\n\nPea-sized hail, waterspouts possible\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a special marine warning for winds potentially greater than 50 knots and steep waves in waters off Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\nThe warning, issued shortly after 8 a.m. Friday, covers the water from Point Sal to Santa Cruz Island, including San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands, and from Point Mugu to San Mateo Point, including Catalina and Anacapa islands.\n\nPea-sized hail and waterspouts are possible, the agency said. The warning remains in effect until 10:15 a.m.\n\n'Very disruptive' storm\n\nClimatologist William Patzert described the storm as “very strong” and “very cold.”\n\nThe system came out of northern Canada, dropping down the coast of California. Typically, storms lose intensity as they move south. But this one is maintaining its horsepower, said Patzert, formerly at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.\n\nHe called Friday the “big show” for Southern California. Some areas could get 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, and spots in the mountains may see blizzard conditions.\n\n“This is going to be a very disruptive and potentially dangerous system,” he said.\n\nSnow on I-5\n\nAuthorities reported about 8 to 10 inches of snow through the Tejon Pass Friday morning. Interstate 5 is closed in the area from Grapevine Road to Parker Road, Caltrans said in a tweet.\n\nPopular preserve closes\n\nThe Ventura Land Trust closed the popular Harmon Canyon Preserve as of Friday morning.\n\nThe popular hiking area in the Ventura hillsides closed for several weeks earlier this year after getting pummeled in January storms. The downpours washed out roads, mud slid down hills and several sinkholes opened up, one an estimated 30-feet deep.\n\nThis closure should not last as long, according to the trust. The preserve generally closes one day for every quarter-inch of rainfall to allow for trail maintenance and the soil to dry out. Periodic rain is expected in the area through Wednesday.\n\nBlizzard, wind, flood warnings in effect\n\nAs the storm intensifies, the National Weather Service issued warned of potentially hazardous conditions in Ventura County. Here is the list as of 4 a.m. Friday.\n\nBlizzard Warning: Ventura County mountains. Expires 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHigh Surf Advisory: Ventura County beaches. Expires 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nWind Advisory: Ventura County’s central and southeastern valleys, beaches, inland coast, Lake Casitas, Ojai Valley, Santa Monica Mountains. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Ventura County’s central and southeastern valleys and inland coast, Ojai Valley, Lake Casitas. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Santa Monica Mountains. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Ventura County mountains. Expires 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHeavier rain on the way\n\nAs of 6:30 a.m. Friday, Ventura County was on the edge of the brunt of the storm.\n\nSome heavier rain and snow was hitting areas above Ojai and local mountains. But the heavier activity – downpours, isolated thunderstorms and possibly a waterspout – was slamming the western side of Santa Barbara County, said Eric Boldt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\n\"We're looking at quite a bit of heavy rain throughout the day in Ventura County,\" Boldt said. \"I would say late morning, through the afternoon and into the evening, that's when we're going to be hit hardest here locally.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the low pressure system heading down the California coast will move right over top of Ventura County, he said. That means more unstable conditions, heavy downpours, small hail and some lightning.\n\nSnow closes interstate\n\nThe California Highway Patrol and Caltrans closed I-5 through the Tejon Pass around 4 a.m. Friday because of snow and low visibility. Highway 101 was the only viable alternative route.\n\nRain pushes into Ventura County\n\nAs of 8 p.m. Thursday, shower activity was expanding into western Ventura County, said meteorologist Robbie Munroe with the National Weather Service office in Oxnard.\n\nA warm front had set up offshore that was pushing the rain toward the area, he said. The warm front was more pronounced than anticipated, he said, which could lift some expected snow levels higher than previously forecast, although some snow could still fall as low as 2,000 to 3,000 feet.\n\nRainfall was likely to increase through the night along with a cold front. The heaviest and most widespread precipitation was expected Thursday night through Friday afternoon, Munroe said. Showers that linger through Saturday could also bring thunderstorms.\n\nSnow at higher elevations, especially above 5,000 feet, could reach 2 to 5 feet, creating dangerous conditions. A rare blizzard warning for mountain areas includes possible whiteouts and strong winds. The weight of snow, coupled with wind, could down trees, disrupt power and damage roofs.\n\nAn avalanche expert at the weather service has concerns about steep terrain in mountain areas where snow and wind combine, Munroe said. The greatest threat for an avalanche is typically within 24 hours of a storm.\n\nRecord low tied at LAX\n\nA low of 41 degrees recorded at Los Angeles International Airport Thursday tied the record low for the date set in 2019, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDuring a heavy rain squall around 11 a.m., the temperature fell from 51 to 41 degrees in less than an hour, the agency reported.\n\nNo records were noted for the Camarillo Airport station or the weather service office in Oxnard, the two sites in Ventura County where the agency tracks historical data.\n\nEarly snow impacts passes\n\nSnow fell on Highway 154 in Santa Barbara County Thursday afternoon, closing the route over San Marcos Pass, elevation 2,200 feet, for a time. After dusting the Santa Ynez Valley, the storm moved into the Ojai Valley, bringing bouts of rain and dropping some snow on surrounding mountainsides.\n\nWeather could close Highway 154 intermittently as the brunt of the storm arrives, officials said.\n\nIn Ventura County, Highway 33 remains closed above the Matilija Hot Springs area, as it has been since heavy rainstorms washed away portions of the route in early January.\n\nSome snow fell along the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 Thursday, but as of 6:45 p.m. Thursday, the highway was open.\n\nYou can check on updates for state highways and freeways at the Caltrans road information site.\n\nCounty issues evacuation warnings\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff's Office of Emergency Services on Thursday issued evacuation warnings for several areas hit hard by last month's storms. Repairs and cleanup are still underway, leaving spots more vulnerable.\n\nAn evacuation warning means people should be prepared to leave but the threat is not yet imminent. The warnings take effect at 3 p.m. Thursday through 10 a.m. Saturday unless conditions stabilize:\n\nMatilija Canyon Road in areas north of Fairview Road, including North Fork and Camino Cielo, in Ojai\n\nCreek Road near San Antonio Creek and Old Creek Road in Ojai\n\nCamp Chaffee at Casitas Vista Road near Camp Chaffee\n\nVentura Beach RV Park in Ventura (through 6:00 p.m. Friday)\n\nForecast calls for snow, rain\n\nThe brunt of this week's unusually cold storm is expected to sweep through Ventura and Los Angeles counties Friday and Saturday, bringing more snow, heavy rain and gusty winds.\n\nThe forecast called for 2 to 5 inches in the county's coastal and valley areas from Thursday through Saturday. In higher elevations, 2 to 5 feet of snow above 4,000 to 5,000 feet and 6 to 12 inches of snow from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.\n\nOn Thursday, some bouts of rain moved through Ventura County, with snow dusting peaks visible from the Ojai Valley and Santa Paula, among other spots.\n\nThis story will be updated.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/20/western-north-carolina-native-brook-trout-slowly-gaining-foothold-again/3632998002/", "title": "Western North Carolina native brook trout slowly gaining foothold ...", "text": "GRAVEYARD FIELDS – If brook trout could speak, they might have gurgled something like “back off!” to the men stalking them with Ghostbuster-like backpack electrofishers, nets and scissors.\n\nBut the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission brook trout team technicians shocked, netted, measured and snipped some fish DNA as quickly as they could, telling the trout how pretty they were, before setting them back into their watery wilderness of the Yellowstone Prong in the Pisgah National Forest.\n\nAnd if the fish could understand Southern Appalachian English, they would know the momentary distress and disorientation was done out of love, and for their own survival, which in some places in the mountains of Western North Carolina is in dire straits.\n\n\"Brook trout have probably lost 70-85% of their historic range. They’ve really retreated up into high elevation headwater systems,” said Jake Rash, coldwater research coordinator with the wildlife commission’s Inland Fisheries Division.\n\nHe was leading the brook trout conservation crew on a warm, sunny, early May day. The crew waded the high-elevation Yellowstone Prong that runs quick and clear under alternating pockets of sunlight and shade from river birches and rhododendron through national forest land, just off the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nConservation technicians Kenneth Lingerfelt, sporting the electrofisher backpack and probes that sent electric currents into the stream to momentarily stun the fish, was followed closely by Justin Nichols with polarized sunglasses, a net and quick reflexes, were on a fish-finding mission.\n\nThe team’s goal was the “beautiful” brook trout, the only trout species native to Western North Carolina, which through a variety of unfortunate circumstances, has greatly diminished.\n\nRELATED: French Broad River: clean and safe?\n\nRELATED: Tryon Equestrian Center improperly handles animal waste, violates water quality standards\n\nRELATED: Wastewater in the North Toe River? DEQ reviews permits\n\nIn an effort to reverse course for the future of this heritage fish, the wildlife commission and many partners including the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, Trout Unlimited, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture, are working to ensure healthy, fishable wild brook trout populations throughout their historic range and set them on a thriving path to sustainability.\n\n“Brook trout are a species of conservation value that mean a lot to a lot of people. Culturally, folks grew up in the mountains fishing for brook trout, and still love to fish for brook trout,” Rash said.\n\n“They have a high recreation value. But being native, they also have a real ecological and biological significance.”\n\nAnd economic significance. According to a 2015 study on North Carolina’s trout fishing industry, 149,000 trout anglers fished about 1.6 million days in 2014, heaping an estimated $383 million economic impact in local communities through fishing equipment purchases, food and lodging, as well as secondary spending by businesses associated with trout angling and their employees.\n\nRELATED: Trout fishing nets huge haul for WNC economy\n\nLingerfelt, who grew up in Asheville, graduated from UNC Asheville and has been with the Wildlife Commission for four years, said he caught his very first brook trout in the Yellowstone Prong, so the river, and the conservation work he’s doing, has sentimental significance.\n\nBut he said the massive efforts to restore native brook trout aren’t just for anglers’ delight.\n\n“I think it’s important for people to know that we are out here working hard to understand what’s happening with brook trout populations, their health, what’s impacting those populations, so we can educate and further contribute to strengthen the species as a whole in the Southeast,” Lingerfelt said.\n\n“Brook trout are an incredible indicator species for high water quality and good ecosystem health. That trickles down to everything downstream.”\n\nWhere did all the brook trout go?\n\nBrook trout are known locally as “brookies,” “specks” or “speckled trout,” due to the dark green, worm-like markings on their backs and tails, and yellow spots on their sides. They are known for their good looks and especially stunning, bright colors that come on in autumn.\n\nThe only Southern Appalachian native trout, brookies were once plentiful in the East, all the way from Georgia to Maine.\n\nThey can be thought of us quite picky about their homes. They will inhabit only clean, cold, clear and fast-moving streams at elevations averaging 3,000 feet above sea level here in North Carolina, with plenty of shaded banks and large rocks for nesting and spawning.\n\nGraveyard Field sits at over 5,000 feet in elevation.\n\nWhile brook trout have historically been a prized game fish, the wild species won’t win any “big fish” records on Instagram. They grow only 5-7 inches long in the wild here, Rash said, and are more often caught, admired and released and than caught for dinner.\n\nRash talks about brookies like a kid showing off his latest video game: \"The cool thing about trout is they're dark on top, and light on bottom. If you’re looking down, at them, they're camouflaged. If you're underneath them, they look like the sky.\"\n\nHe also admired their torpedo-shaped body, made to orient to the current without having to do much much and still stay on track.\n\n\"If we think of these charismatic critters that are pretty, fun to catch, some like to eat them, but what benefits them, absolutely benefits everything else downstream, and that could be a human,\" Rash said.\n\nBut life took a turn for the worse for brook trout at the turn of the last century. At the end of the 1800s and early 1900s, the logging industry — and road building to reach the giant, deep-forest trees — exploded across the mountains.\n\nThe clear-cutting on steep slopes caused significant damage to streams through erosion and sedimentation. This loss of habitat reduced brook trout populations throughout their range, and in many cases, entire populations were lost completely.\n\nWell-meaning attempts in the 20th century to return fish to mountain streams for the fishing public proved to be another hurdle for the brook trout.\n\n“Since that time they have also faced encroachment by other trout. Whether rainbow trout, which are from the West coast, or brown trout from Europe, they have moved in and occupied a lot of the ranges that brook would have historically,” Rash said.\n\nIn addition, efforts to enhance the populations in the early 1900s were by stocking brook trout from hatcheries up north, further muddying the native populations.\n\nWhile not listed as an endangered species, wild brook trout are identified in the N.C. Wildlife Action Plan as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need.\n\nFiguring out fish DNA\n\nThe first step in brook trout restoration is finding out where the native populations still are and figuring out their genetics, Rash said.\n\nTo that end, the brook trout conservation crew searches out the headwater streams in the mountains, which are typically in the upper watersheds high in the Nantahala and Pisgah national forests.\n\nThere are some 5,000 miles of trout waters in WNC, with more than 700 brook trout populations, Rash said.\n\nAfter shocking and netting brook trout, the crew anesthetizes them, then weighs, measures and snips off a tiny piece of fin tissue to send to the USGS Leetown Science Center lab in West Virginia, sort of the AncestryDNA.com for fish, to find out who a trout's daddy and grandaddy are.\n\nThe technicians also check the fish for signs of whirling disease, gill lice or other pathogens.\n\n“Using microsatellite DNA analysis, we’re able to compare what we have here vs. other brook trout populations in the state, and the whole range,” Rash said.\n\n“We can see how genetically diverse these fish are, or if they are essentially isolated and inbred, so there’s low genetic diversity. Also, we can determine if there has been any influence from historic hatchery stockings. If we have that information across populations, instead of randomly moving brook trout, it helps us make better decisions about picking what should be the best source population to move fish from and where to move them to,” he said.\n\nIt also helps with other conservation efforts, like habitat restoration projects done in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and nonprofits like Trout Unlimited.\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nLorie Stroup, fisheries biologist with the Pisgah National Forest, said the Forest Service’s focus on brook trout restoration is home makeovers, so to speak.\n\nBecause WNC streambeds are granitic rock, they are nutrient-poor, Stroup said, and look to the trees for nutrients.\n\nBut the intensive logging in the early 20th century ripped out trees right up to the rivers’ edges.\n\n“A lot of our streams in WNC lack large woody debris. We’ve taken sections that were devoid of wood and tried to enhance that,” Stroup said.\n\nUsing “hundreds and hundreds” of volunteers, the Forest Service works to improve river access and trails for people to prevent erosion, riparian plantings for bank stability, and install split rail fencing for protection of riparian habitat all along the Davidson River corridor, which is one of the most heavily used sections in Pisgah National Forest.\n\nVolunteers and partners are priceless in fish conservation work, Stroup said, because she is the lone fisheries biologist for Pisgah, which is “covered up” in recreation. The Pisgah and Nantahala national forests together consist of more than 1 million acres of mountainous terrain and are two of the busiest forests in the country with an estimated 5-6 million visitors a year, from anglers to hunters, hikers and mountain bikers.\n\nStroup also works with armies of volunteers to remove barriers to fish movement, such as bridges and culverts, most recently on Cathy’s Creek, which is a tributary to the French Broad River. The key is to allow fish to move freely through a stream system to connect with other populations, for long term genetic diversity, she said.\n\n“Our goal is to protect what native species we have, whether nonprofits, government or state agencies. Brook trout are our only native trout species. They’ve been resilient, but they’ve also been very sensitive to changes in the environment,” Stroup said.\n\n“The way we’ve used the land in the past has had an impact on brook trout, not to mention putting in rainbow and brown trout, so the competition for food and habitat became critical. We were pretty hard on brook trout at the turn of the century.”\n\nShe said even though government land managers, conservation nonprofits and private landowners now see the benefit to undoing past wrongs, keeping a vibrant brook trout population will require constant vigilance.\n\n“I think we’re always going to have to be mindful for restoration opportunities because of the amount of use of our public lands, and with climate change and things out of our control,” she said. “But these species are definitely worth fighting for and keeping resilient.”\n\nAndy Brown, Southern Appalachian stream restoration manager for Trout Unlimited, has been working with the Forest Service and state Wildlife Commission for years on what he sees are the three threats to the viability of native brook trout: sedimentation, fragmentation of habitat and temperature.\n\nTrout Unlimited works to remove culverts that fragment habitat by not allowing fish to get up to areas they need to access to nest and spawn, and to keep trout streams cold by working with private landowners to replant forested buffers, replacing shade on the water.\n\nHe said TU also works to remediate old logging roads built adjacent to streams and on steep slopes, leading to runoff and stream sedimentation. For this project, Brown said, the nonprofit has recently launched a citizen science program to get boots on the ground for data collection through sedimentation surveys.\n\nRELATED: Find your perfect trail to hike in WNC\n\nTrout Unlimited will hold two or three trainings a month for next three to four months, Brown said, around Davidson and Tuckasegee rivers and in the Wilson Creek Wild and Scenic River watershed around Morganton and Lenoir.\n\n“You just have to have an enthusiasm to learn and to help out. We emphasize teamwork and fun. If you feel like you’re limited in biological and scientific understanding, you can still hold a tape measure or take photographs,” Brown said.\n\nHe admits the volunteers now are mostly “old, retired white guys,” but encourages people of all backgrounds who enjoy being outdoors to help in the group’s conservation work.\n\nBrittany Watkins, 26, of Lenoir, just went to a Trout Unlimited training a month ago. She doesn’t fish but said she signed up because she loves the outdoors and wanted to do something “to contribute.”\n\n“It was really cool, a fun day,” Watkins said of the five-hour training on Wilson’s Creek. The volunteers learned to use an app, download maps, identify drainage points and types of trail tread, and fill out surveys as they hike a trail, answering questions such as “how is water getting off the trail,” and “how much water is reaching the streams?”\n\n“The goal is to see how much sediment is coming off the trail and affecting the fish using the water as habitat,” Watkins said.\n\nVolunteers, whom Brown calls “data loggers,” are asked to commit to a 4-5-hour hike three times a year, with a buddy.\n\n“I love the diversity of WNC and I think it’s important for any fish or animal, to protect their habitat so we don’t lose that diversity,” Watkins said. “It’s one of those things that once you do it, you’re never going to look at trails or rivers the same way. This makes you a steward of the land, when you’re out with your friends.”\n\nHow are brook trout faring in the Great Smokies?\n\nWhile it might seem that brook trout must be doing swimmingly in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, essentially a half-million-acre nature preserve on the mountainous Eastern Tennessee-Western North Carolina border, fisheries biologist Matt Kulp said that isn’t quite so.\n\nAlso a member of the brook trout conservation network, the Smokies might have one of the most serious signs of the species’ decline, said Kulp, who has worked in the park’s fisheries division for 25 years.\n\nIn addition to suffering habitat destruction from the logging era and competition from the stocking on non-native rainbow and brown trout, Smokies brook trout have felt the sting of acid rain, to the tune of some 75% of range loss in the national park, Kulp said.\n\nAcid deposition, fueled by pollution spewing from coal-burning power plants in Tennessee, had devastated air quality and plant life at higher elevations in the Smokies. But even after the 2002 Clean Smokestacks Act, and the enormous reduction in fossil fuel burning — 78% reduction in sulphur and 56% reduction in nitrogen, Kulp said — the problem has lasting impact.\n\nRELATED: How clean is Western North Carolina's air?\n\n“The acid rain is acidifying some of those high elevation ridges and causing additional range loss at top ends, whereas logging and rainbow trout were really a bottom up affect, lower portion of watersheds on up,” Kulp said.\n\n“So much acid rain has been deposited in soils. In many cases, higher elevation soils are approaching saturation for nitrogen. It will take a long time to leach out. The air quality is better, and rainwater is better, but soils are in bad shape. (A recent study showed) it will take to the year 2100 before streams can start to recover so they can start to support fish. In some streams that are more acidified, there’s no fish in the upper ends of them,” he said.\n\nOut of 2,900 miles of streams in the Smokies, only 40% have fish in them, Kulp said..\n\nThe park started intensive brook trout restoration in the 1980s through fits and starts, adhering to its mission of protecting and preserving native species and cultural resources.\n\nRELATED: Who killed the French Broad? Who revived it? New documentary answers questions\n\nRELATED: Eastern hellbenders lose bid for federal protection\n\nKulp said in recent decades, the techniques have been refined, resulting in the restoration of 13 streams and just over 48.5 kilometers (30 miles) of streams since the 1980s.\n\nTo get to this point, a lot of focus has been on eradicating the non-native rainbow trout, through electrofishing — making electric shocking passes through a streams two-three times every couple of weeks for a few months with the help of Smokies, Forest Service, Wildlife Commission staff and interns and volunteers — and more recently through a fish pesticide called antimycin.\n\n“It’s a naturally occurring bacteria found in soils, that naturally breaks down. It’s one of five EPA approved fish pesticides. It’s used in very low concentrations — 8 parts per billion over eight hours,” Kulp said. “It’s pretty innovative. We distribute it through buckets of water. It doesn’t harm humans. It kills bacteria. It’s kind of like penicillin.”\n\nThose fish die in place, stay in the creek and remain as nutrients for crayfish and other aquatic organisms and insects. After a stream is deemed “clean” of rainbow trout, crews will start to reintroduce brook trout.\n\nOne stream in the Smokies where you can find native brook trout today is Deep Creek near Bryson City.\n\nAnthony Creek in Cades Cove and Little Cataloochee Creek have recently been treated with antimycin, Kulp said, and should be stocked with brook trout soon.\n\nThe loss of native brook trout is even more dire on the Qualla Boundary, home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, which borders the Smokies in places.\n\nMike LaVoie, natural resources manager for the EBCI, said wild brook trout, an important heritage species prized by Cherokee anglers for food and recreation, today occupy less than 10% of their historical range in EBCI waters.\n\nRELATED: Great Smokies approve historic pact with Cherokee to harvest sochan\n\nThese fish have fallen victim as well to habitat degradation and introgression from non-native species, and are threatened by the recent discovery of non-native fish diseases and parasite threats, including whirling disease and gill lice.\n\n“We also have significant concerns based on recent EBCI climate vulnerability assessments conducted with N.C. State that brook trout could be eliminated almost completely from tribal waters by the end of the century,” LaVoie said.\n\nSince 2008, EBCI Fisheries and Wildlife Management has been working on inventory and monitoring to first identify where they have existing wild brook trout populations, completed genetic assessments of these existing populations and performed many habitat projects such as replacing culverts that serve as barriers to movement, stormwater management, and stream buffer restoration to improve bank stability and increase shading.\n\nThe tribe is also in the planning phase for identifying suitable streams that have barriers to prevent future non-native trout invasion for restoration. One possible site has been identified on Mingo Creek.\n\n“The EBCI also recently finalized their federally (EPA) approved water quality standards, one of only around 50 tribes in the country, which will allow for stronger protection of wild trout within EBCI watersheds,” LaVoie said.\n\nRELATED: Climate report: Southern forests are threatened\n\nAlso a member of the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture, LaVoie stressed how important partnerships across agency and state boundaries are when it comes to saving the wild brook trout.\n\n“Brook trout are a key species in terms of a system, a watershed, they’re at the top where the water starts. If we can work on these waters on the top of mountains, that’s incredibly important for everything downstream, for other fish and hellbenders, and people. It’s part of the lure and draw to be here,” said Rash, in emphasizing the role that brook trout play in the ecosystem at large.\n\n“We want to live in a place that is healthy and want our waters to be healthy. What’s good for us, what’s good for critters, it can start with what’s good for brook trout. That’s the beauty of nature. Everything is connected. Nothing is done in a vacuum.”\n\nWant to help?\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering with Trout Unlimited's data logging program as part of its efforts to restore native brook trout, email Andy Brown at abrown@tu.org.\n\nWild brook trout fish facts:\n\nFamily: Salmonidae\n\nNicknames: Brookies, speckled trout, specks\n\nAverage length: 6-8 inches\n\nAverage weight: 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 pound\n\nDescription: Olive-green coloration of the upper sides with mottled, dark green “worm-like” markings on their backs and tails.

They've been stringing us along. They could have told us this four months ago,\" said Charlie Tucker, president of the community district board of directors.\n\nThe district has been trying unsuccessfully since last summer to get help from state and federal officials to help pay the cost of cleaning out the outlet pipes.\n\nThe district estimates the work would cost from $1.7 million to $2.1 million, more than the district can afford. The district provides irrigation water to 50 to 60 customers in the Ono area.\n\nWeather:Heavy rain leads to flooded streets in Redding\n\nTo help the district qualify for federal and state emergency funds, the board approved a local emergency due to the dam back in July and renewed the declaration in November.\n\nThe emergency resolution says \"conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property,\" exist at Misselbeck Dam.\n\nTucker said the outlet pipes are covered with about 20 feet of of sediment and other debris that were washed into the lake from the surrounding hillsides.\n\nThe 2018 Carr Fire left a burn scar covering 90% of the 12-square-mile watershed above 113-acre Rainbow Lake, according to a letter the district sent to the supervisors last summer.\n\nDistrict officials say the 2018 Carr Fire left hillsides devoid of vegetation that would normally hold in place soil, ash and other debris. All that debris and sediment washed into the lake and plugged the outlet pipes.\n\nJohn Moore, also a member of the district board of directors, said funding has been denied because federal and state officials don't believe the issues at the dam are a result of the Carr Fire.\n\nIf the district can show a direct relationship to the fire, they would be more likely to receive financial help, he said.\n\nInsurance:Many Dignity hospitals might no longer be taking this insurance in 2020\n\n\"If you take away the fire, we don't have all the runoff with leaves and sticks and sediment and whatnot,\" Moore said.\n\nDistrict officials have also enlisted the help of state and federal elected officials, who have written to the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBack in October, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa wrote a letter to FEMA asking it to determine the problems at the dam be categorized as a \"direct effect from the Carr Fire and eligible for federal disaster aid.\"\n\n\"Obviously, this is one of those items that we just need to see fixed and quickly,\" LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel said.\n\nMoore said he didn't understand why the federal and state governments issued more than $10 million in grants to do erosion control to keep ash and other debris from being washed into Shasta County streams following the Carr Fire, but won't help the Igo Ono district recover from similar Carr Fire-caused damage.\n\nMoore said the Western Shasta Resource Conservation District in Anderson received the money to do the work.\n\n\"But on our side of the ridge, we get the 'sorry fellas, but all this ash and debris is not due to the Carr Fire,'\" said Moore, who is also a director for the conservation district.\n\nDistrict officials are worried that over the winter, more logs and debris will be washed into the lake and block water water from going over the spillway. If the water rises too high it could overtop the dam and cause it to fail, the board wrote in a letter to the board of supervisors.\n\nThe district says a study by the Office of Water Safety at Sacramento State University estimates that if water overtops the dam, the structure \"would be destroyed for its entire height and nearly its entire width in a period of 6 minutes.\"\n\n\"Failure of the dam or spillway would endanger lives and property between the dam and Cottonwood,\" the district said.\n\n$22M Center of Hope is moving ahead: 5 things you should know about the new campus\n\nSeveral structures on Sunny Hill Road downstream of the dam would be inundated with 20 feet of water within 15 minutes of dam breach and multiple structures on Gas Point Road would be under 10 feet of water, the district said.\n\nIt would take about 2 hours for water flowing down the North Fork of Cottonwood Creek from the dam to reach the area of Lower Gas Point Road, and at that point the water would be about 17 feet deep, according to an inundation map made by Sacramento State.\n\nIt would take about 9 hours for the water to reach Interstate 5 where it crosses over Cottonwood Creek, the map says. At that point, the water would be about 8 feet deep.\n\nStructures near the main stem of Cottonwood Creek and structures on Ponder Way and Denise Way would also see water up to 5 feet deep, the district said.\n\n\"The worst-case scenario is the dam breach occurring when Cottonwood Creek is already at flood stage, which is the more likely scenario given the current outlet works condition,\" the district said.\n\nIs your home at risk?

The legislation provides $52.7 billion in federal aid to restore manufacturing of the tiny devices to the U.S. considered vital to the economy that has been largely shipped overseas in past decades.\n\n\"This will mark one of the largest investments ever in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters.\n\n\"We think this is a defining moment for the United States, the semiconductor industry and Intel,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.\n\nThe grants and loans along with a 25% investment tax credit included in the legislation will help Intel with what its now says is a $28 billion project, up from $20 billion initially, in Licking County, where it is building two factories along with expansions in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon.\n\nThe Commerce Department would not say how much Intel is getting for the Licking County project, indicating that its approach was a more holistic look at all of Intel's U.S. operations.\n\nGelsinger said Intel expects the company to receive benefits totaling more than $25 billion from the tax credit, reflective of what he says is more than $100 billion in qualified investments that the company is making over the next five years.\n\nHe said the low-cost loans come with favorable terms that will help drive Intel's investment.\n\nThe award is part of the Biden administration's push to manufacture leading-edge chips in the U.S. needed to power advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Right now, the U.S. designs these chips but doesn't make any here, said Raimondo, who has set a goal of manufacturing 20% of these chips in the U.S. by 2030.\n\n\"We rely on a very small number on a factories in Asia for all of our most sophisticated chips,\" Raimondo said. \"That’s untenable and unacceptable. It’s an economic security problem. It’s a national security problem, and we’re going to change that.\"\n\nIntel to create 30,000 jobs nationwide\n\nThe president formally announced the award to Intel on Wednesday in Arizona, where the company is building two factories and modernizing a third one at its campus in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler.\n\nThe Biden administration's targeted investments in U.S. industries, which the White House has dubbed the Investing in America program, have \"ignited a manufacturing boom in America, a clean energy boom, a jobs boom, all here in America, finally,\" the president said in Arizona.\n\nIntel's expansion at its four campuses in the U.S. is expected to create 30,000 jobs and tens of thousands of indirect jobs, according to the Biden administration.\n\nIn Ohio, Intel is expected to create 3,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio, 7,000 construction jobs and an estimated 10,000 indirect jobs. The $28 billion investment is the largest in state history.\n\nIntel has spent $1.5 billion and hired 69 workers through 2023 and has committed to an additional $3 billion in spending on the project, according to a report filed by the company with the state.\n\nIntel also is receiving more than $2 billion in incentives from Ohio and New Albany.\n\nWhen the Intel project was announced for Licking County, the company anticipated starting production in 2025. Now it expects construction of both plants to be finished in 2026-27 and to become operational in 2027-2028.\n\nGelsinger told reporters Tuesday night that the Ohio project remains a track that the company indicated was possible when work began.\n\n\"The factory is being built today,\" he said. \"If you show up at the site, we're taking a field and turning into the most modern manufacturing location in the Intel network.\"\n\nMoney to be awarded later this year\n\nThe Commerce Department said it expects money to begin flowing before the end of the year after final details with Intel are worked out.\n\nThe awards are conditioned upon Intel hitting milestones along the way, including its commitment to work with state and local agencies, labor unions, and colleges and universities to develop and train workers for jobs created by the investment.\n\nThe Biden administration has declared Columbus a workforce hub meant to train workers for the jobs in the region by such companies as Intel and Honda's electric battery plant with LG Energy in Jeffersonville, and Intel previously announced a $100 million commitment to local and national higher education programs over the next decade.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Intel's building spree wouldn't be possible without the aid, and Gelsinger said there likely will need to be a second CHIPS act to continue the work of bringing back production to the U.S. where costs are higher than in Asia.\n\n\"We need to build the best stuff,\" he said. \"We have to get back to leadership.\"\n\nOhio leaders applaud CHIPS award\n\nA bipartisan group of political, business and labor leaders praised the announcement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Clearly, we're going to get a good share of this money,\" said Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican. \"This should be looked at as a very happy day in Ohio. We continue to have the money to keep this great project going.\"\n\n\"It's going to allow this project to reach its full potential,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat.\n\n“I’ve never see this in my 37 years in the building trades,’’ said Mike Knisley, secretary-treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.\n\n\"We are going to be building for a long time,\" said Steve Stivers, president of the Ohio Chamber and former Republican congressman.\n\nmawilliams@dispatch.com\n\n@BizMarkWilliams", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/03/22/rep-andy-biggs-district-benefitting-from-chips-act-he-voted-against/73057884007/", "title": "Rep.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the country's vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, Biden said. Advanced chip manufacturing is making a comeback in America after 40 years.\n\n\"If it was invented in America, it ought to be made in America,\" he said, in reference to semiconductors.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo earlier said Biden is \"tired of being at the end of the supply chain,\" adding that the CHIPS Act funding is designed to change that.\n\nThe administration seeks to have 20% of advanced semiconductors made in this country by the end of the decade, up from none currently, she added.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nBiden says his administration 'ignited a manufacturing boom in America'\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the stage just after noon on Tuesday at Intel's Ocotillo Campus in Chandler to announce a multi-billion dollar grant for the company to build out semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of hundreds of people, Biden portrayed the grant as evidence that his economic program has begun to work.\n\nHis program of targeted investments in U.S. industry, which the White House has dubbed the 'Investing in America' program, has \"ignited a manufacturing boom in America, a clean energy boom, a jobs boom, all here in America, finally,\" the president said.\n\n\"We have more to do. I get it: we have more to do.

Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\nFive chip “wafers” were displayed on the table in front of Biden.\n\n“I was stunned at how thin the fibers are,” Biden said, holding one of the wafers.\n\n“I’ll be darned,” he said. “You’re bringing the future back to America.”\n\nThe president has touted the CHIPS and Science Act, which he signed in 2022, as part of his efforts to revitalize American manufacturing.\n\n— Laura Gersony\n\nIntel exec projects 2025 marketplace entry, says federal money ‘definitely not a bailout’\n\nIntel expects its advanced chips from CHIPS Act funding to start showing up in the marketplace by 2025.\n\nKeyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer, also bristled at one reporter's question about the need for a well-capitalized company like Intel to need $8.5 billion in federal grants. \"This is definitely not a bailout,\" he said. \"Intel is investing billions of dollars ourselves.\"\n\nEsfarjani said there's often a 13-times multiplier effect of local communities, meaning that each dollar invested by Intel in Chandler will engender $13 in other investments from local suppliers and even secondary firms like hotels.\n\n\"When we come (to a community), the suppliers come with us,\" he said.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nIntel exec stresses importance of domestic supply chain\n\nKeyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer, emphasized the need for the U.S. to re-establish dominance in advanced semiconductors, partly for national security reasons.\n\n\"More than 90% of the advanced chips are currently made outside the U.S.,\" he told reporters covering the event. \"That is definitely not OK.\"\n\nEsfarjani also emphasized the need to develop more of a domestic supply chain for this critical industry.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nRoughly 40% of new jobs won’t require a college degree, Intel says\n\nWhile the focus of the CHIPS Act and Intel's involvement centers on expanding U.S. manufacturing of advanced semiconductors, many of the jobs that will be created won't require a college education. Around 40% could involve technician positions, company officials said.\n\nChristy Pambianchi, Intel's chief people officer, encouraged potential applicants to see what's available on the company's website. She also emphasized the company's training and apprenticeship program through the Maricopa Community College system.\n\nPambianchi said those programs are a way for people who lack a college degree to gain employment with the company. Even current Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger started as a technician at a company plant in California, she said.\n\n— Russ Wiles\n\nBiden visit prompts focus on workers’ rights\n\nPresident Joe Biden's visit already has resulted in calls for treating workers well.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday morning, a coalition of labor and environmental groups asked Intel to sign agreements they say will ensure workers and surrounding communities around the new projects “have a fair deal.”\n\nThe coalition includes the Sierra Club, an environmental group, and the United Auto Workers, one of the nation’s larger unions with outsize political clout in the swing state of Michigan.\n\nTaking questions from press on Wednesday morning, top Intel officers didn’t directly answer whether such an agreement would be on the table.\n\n“We have a longstanding history of working very closely with all the communities within which we operate. We’ve been here in Arizona for over 40 years,” said Christy Pambianchi, Chief People Officer at Intel. “It’s hard to tell where Intel and the communities are separated. For us, that’s just a way of doing business.”\n\nWhile running for president in 2020, President Joe Biden said he would ensure federal contracts only go to employers that sign an agreement saying they won’t oppose unionization efforts, also known as a “neutrality agreement.”\n\n— Russ Wiles and Laura Gersony\n\nWhy Intel? What to know\n\nIntel is the world’s second-largest producer of semiconductor chips, which are basically tiny brains that help power everything from cellphones to air conditioners.\n\nIt set up shop in Chandler in 1980 and the city is now home to Intel’s only two large-scale facilities in Arizona. The company generates nearly $9 billion in statewide economic impact each year.\n\nThe company also is spending $20 billion to expand one of its Chandler facilities. It will make the local campus Intel’s largest manufacturing complex anywhere on earth at a time when the world needs a secure supply of chips more than ever.\n\nThe company’s two main facilities in Chandler are called the Ocotillo campus and the Chandler campus. The Ocotillo campus is almost exclusively focused on manufacturing semiconductors. The Ocotillo site is massive. It’s made up of more than a dozen buildings and occupies roughly 700 acres in southwest Chandler.\n\n— Sam Kmack\n\nHow big a deal is the microchip industry in Arizona?\n\nIt’s huge. Metro Phoenix is one of the nation’s hubs for this technology.\n\nSince January 2020, 35 companies in the semiconductor industry have announced plans to expand or relocate to Arizona, representing $65 billion in investment, according to data from the Arizona Commerce Authority.\n\nThose companies include massive fabrication facilities, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel, which are both underway on multi-billion-dollar projects to manufacture semiconductors in Phoenix and Chandler. The list also includes dozens of smaller companies that work in the supply chain, including chemical manufacturers, packaging, transportation and other areas that serve the industry.\n\nIn total, the companies represent more than 13,000 jobs, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nDid other presidents visit Arizona microchip plants?\n\nYes. Biden and former President Barack Obama have both come to the Valley to promote chip manufacturing plants.\n\nIn December 2022, Biden visited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s north Phoenix campus for the “tool in” ceremony. At the ceremony, Biden and TSMC executives also announced the expansion of the facility, growing the investment from $12 billion to $40 billion.\n\nObama visited Intel’s campus in January 2012. At the time, the plant was under construction on a $5 billion expansion. Obama used the visit to emphasize the need for domestic manufacturing.\n\nObama's visit was remembered for a tense encounter with then-Gov. Jan Brewer, who stuck her finger in the president's face not long after Air Force One landed.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nWhat is the CHIPS Act?\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law in August 2022. It paved the way for investment of $53 billion into semiconductor manufacturing and research around the country.\n\nThe law was a significant step for Arizona's semiconductor industry, which has been rapidly growing since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced plans to build a massive factory in Phoenix in 2020.\n\nThe Arizona Commerce Authority and other organizations formed the Arizona Small-Scale Supplier Consortium, aimed at showing the importance of individual suppliers in Arizona.\n\nAbout 20 companies are taking part in the supplier consortium, an ACA spokesperson said. In total those companies represent about $1.8 billion in investment and expect to create 3,800 jobs.\n\n— Corina Vanek\n\nWhat is President Biden doing at Intel in Chandler?\n\nBiden was to appear at Intel Corp.’s Ocotillo campus to announce funding from the CHIPS Act for cutting-edge microchip production.\n\nIntel, already one of Arizona's largest employers, will receive up to $8.5 billion in federal grants as part of a preliminary agreement to be announced by President Biden and U.S. Commerce Department officials. The grants would mark one of the largest-ever semiconductor manufacturing investments.\n\nThe $8.5 billion in CHIPS funding that Intel stands to receive, in addition to up to $11 billion in federal loans, will help expand two fabs, or factories, in Chandler. It will also help bring the company's most advanced semiconductors to the market. Building factories like these \"are like building a city,\" said Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel's chief operations officer.\n\nOver the next five years, Intel expects to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. as it expands capacity in Arizona and the other three states, with an estimated creation of more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs.\n\nThe proposal also calls for about $50 million to develop the company's semiconductor and construction workforces.\n\n— Russ Wiles", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/chandler/2023/11/03/arizona-intel-chandler-octillo-campuses/71307450007/", "title": "What to know about Intel, the semiconductor company getting ...", "text": "Chandler’s economy benefits greatly from the presence of Intel, a company that creates the bulk of the city’s jobs and generates massive amounts of financial activity.\n\nIntel is the world’s second-largest producer of semiconductor chips, which are basically tiny brains that help power everything from cellphones to air conditioners.\n\nThe company will receive up to $8.5 billion in federal grants as part of a preliminary agreement to be announced by President Joe Biden and U.S. Commerce Department officials during a visit to Arizona on Wednesday.\n\nThe funding, designed to rebuild America's technological leadership in semiconductors, could be spread among multiple Intel projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon, with Arizona receiving one of the largest commitments.

Here’s what to know.\n\nWhat does Intel do in Chandler?\n\nThe company’s two main facilities in Chandler are called the Ocotillo campus and the Chandler campus.\n\nThe Chandler facility has a broader purpose. Employees there work on everything from Intel’s “autonomous vehicle” efforts to its semiconductor packaging technology to research and development.\n\nThe Ocotillo campus is almost exclusively focused on manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nHow big is Intel in Chandler?\n\nThe Ocotillo site is massive. It’s made up of more than a dozen buildings and occupies roughly 700 acres in southwest Chandler.\n\nIn terms of its importance to the city, Intel is second to none. It’s Chandler’s “leading employer,” according to city spokesperson Stephanie Romero.\n\nStaffers have also said Intel’s multibillion-dollar expansion was one of the major reasons Chandler’s revenue increased by 20% this year. That cash helped Chandler pay off its public safety pension debt earlier than expected.\n\nHow many employees work at Intel in Chandler?\n\nIntel employs 13,000 regular employees. That figure is expected to be closer to 16,000 once its expansion is complete.\n\nIt also created about 8,000 temporary construction jobs as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nWhat jobs are available at Intel’s Chandler locations?\n\nIntel often has hundreds of open positions listed on its website. The jobs range from business analyst jobs to roles for communications interns.\n\nIntel’s Chandler construction: What is the company building?\n\nThe expansion is taking place at the Ocotillo campus. It includes the construction of two new factories, Fabs 52 and 62, which will be finished and fully operational sometime in 2024. Intel started work on the project in late 2021.\n\nThe company is spending $20 billion on the effort. It’s the largest private investment in Arizona’s history and brings the amount of cash that Intel has spent in the state up to roughly $50 billion.\n\nOver the next five years, Intel expects to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. as it expands capacity in Arizona and the other three states, with an estimated creation of more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs.\n\nThe proposed $8.5 billion federal grant, along with Intel's own funding plans, would mark one of the largest-ever semiconductor manufacturing investments.\n\nThe proposal calls for the construction of two new leading-edge logic fabs and modernization of one existing fab at Intel's Chandler campus. That will significantly increase leading-edge capacity, including high-volume domestic production of Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced chip design. The company plans to produce the first 18A product, called Clearwater Forest, in Arizona.\n\nThe proposal also calls for about $50 million to develop the company's semiconductor and construction workforces.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/energy/biden-ally-big-oil-surtax/index.html", "title": "Biden ally pushes Big Oil surtax to eliminate 'perverse' incentives to ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden is drawing up a surtax on Big Oil that would seek to rein in the industry’s skyrocketing profits at a time when gasoline prices are at record highs.\n\nWyden, an Oregon Democrat who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, is floating a 21% surtax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies that generate more than $1 billion in revenue, according to a spokesperson for the senator.\n\n“Our broken tax code is working for Big Oil, not American families,” Wyden told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe proposal, reported earlier by Bloomberg News, also calls for a 25% excise tax on stock buybacks and would close an accounting loophole on inventories that critics say allows oil companies to understate their profits and defer taxes indefinitely.\n\n“The proposal I’m developing would help reverse perverse incentives to price gouge by doubling the corporate tax rate on companies’ excess profits, eliminating egregious buybacks, and reducing accounting tricks,” Wyden said.\n\nSuch a move could be popular given that oil company profits are surging, and gasoline prices are at record highs.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that imposing an additional tax on the oil industry would backfire by depressing investment at a time when companies need to spend more on expensive new drilling projects to keep up with demand.\n\n“Policymakers should be focused on increasing energy supply and reducing costs for Americans,” Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement. “Imposing new taxes on our industry will do the exact opposite and only discourage investment at a time when it’s needed most.”\n\nIt’s not clear if the White House would support the surcharge floated by Wyden.

A representative for the oil industry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Tuesday letter, Biden called for oil companies to boost supply of gasoline and slammed the high profit margins as “unacceptable” at a time when families are grappling with record-high prices.\n\nBiden said he directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to hold an emergency meeting on the issue and to engage with the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee representing the oil-and-gas industry.\n\nThe oil industry quickly pushed back on the President’s arguments.\n\n“We are surprised and disappointed by the President’s letter,” Chet Thompson, CEO of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in a statement.\n\n“Any suggestion that US refiners are not doing our part to bring stability to the market is false,” Thompson said. “We would encourage the Administration to look inward to better understand the role their policies and hostile rhetoric have played in the current environment.”\n\nThe President and his team have acknowledged in recent weeks that there is not much Biden can do to immediately bring down the high gas prices. For the first time ever, a gallon of regular gas hit $5 on average nationwide, according to AAA’s Saturday reading. The issue is a major political problem for the President, who is grappling to bring down high consumer prices amid the worst inflation the nation has seen in decades.\n\nBiden and his administration have repeatedly blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war on Ukraine for rising gas and energy prices, though experts also cite other factors, including high demand, clogged supply chains, rising housing costs and Covid-19 stimulus efforts, as reasons behind the surging prices.\n\nThe President in March announced an unprecedented release of oil from US reserves and also outlined several steps his administration is taking to punish oil companies for not increasing production from unused leases on federal land. The release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will amount to 180 million barrels of oil, and the President has said it would act as a “wartime bridge” as US and global oil production ramps back up after the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administration plans to seek bids this fall to buy 60 million barrels of crude oil as the first step in a years-long process aimed at replenishing America’s emergency oil reserve, an Energy Department official previously told CNN.\n\nThe President this week acknowledged inflation and high food and gas prices are greatly affecting many American families, and conceded he is left without many options to fight the surging prices, particularly in a narrowly divided Senate that has blocked the bulk of his domestic agenda.\n\nIn an aggressive attempt to fight inflation, the US central bank this week increased its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday – the biggest single hike since 1994.

Yes, it’s going to create more than 500 good-paying jobs in Tennessee, but it can deliver greater dignity and little more breathing room to workers and their families,” Biden said at a White House event on the administration’s efforts to revamp American manufacturing, create jobs and lower energy costs for Americans.\n\n“And it’s going to have a ripple effect … far beyond the one state. This is great news for workers across the country for an economy and frankly, for the planet.”\n\nThe President also said it was “another example of what America could achieve” through bipartisanship, namely through the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure law. He also made a point to thank Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee for his involvement in getting the facility to his state.\n\nHe noted that later this week, the Biden administration will announce its state-by-state allocation for $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle chargers.\n\nTritium’s CEO, Jane Hunter, appeared alongside Biden at the White House at an afternoon White House event focused on boosting American manufacturing. National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Infrastructure Act Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu were also in attendance.\n\nBiden has made rebuilding American manufacturing a key component of his economic agenda. One way the President wants to boost manufacturing and create more jobs is by building a sprawling network of electric vehicle charging stations across the country.\n\nThe President argues future electric cars will be more climate-friendly and affordable for American families, and he wants half the vehicles sold in the US to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030. His administration has outlined a plan to use $7.5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country.

The package is significantly larger than the other packages that have been put forward, and is more than twice as much as the $13.6 billion infusion of military and humanitarian aid that Congress approved last month.\n\n“The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back Ukrainian people as they defend their country, or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities in Ukraine,” Biden said.\n\nHe added, “We need this bill to support Ukraine in this fight for freedom.”\n\nThe massive proposal comes as Russia refocuses its campaign to seize new territory in the country’s eastern region. The President said last week Russia’s war has entered a “critical window,” making western military aid all the more essential.\n\nThe $33 billion request includes $20.4 billion requested for military and security assistance, including $5 billion in additional drawdown authorities, $6 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and $4 billion for the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing Program, a senior administration official told reporters ahead of Biden’s remarks.\n\nThe President added that the new package would provide more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor systems and anti-aircraft capabilities to the Ukrainian military, as well as humanitarian assistance, including food, water, medicine and shelter to Ukrainians displaced by the war.\n\nThe goal of the funding is to both address the immediate needs of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian people as well as help the nation “transition to longer-term security systems,” Biden said.\n\nThe President said the US was working with other nations – including Korea, Japan and Qatar – to support European allies being threatened by Russia “with gas blackmail,” in order to help the countries get their energy needs met. Russia has started to suspend natural gas supplies to certain European countries after they rejected Putin’s ultimatum to pay in rubles, rather than euros.\n\n“We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions. We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression,” Biden said.\n\nBillions in aid for Ukraine’s defense\n\nThe official said a portion of the $20 billion in military assistance could be used to backfill contributions of munitions and equipment from other countries, allowing those countries to “be able to defend themselves fully.”\n\nAlso included in the request is $8.5 billion in economic assistance “to help the government of Ukraine respond to the immediate crisis and continue to provide basic services to the Ukrainian people,” the official said. A fact sheet from the White House suggested that funding would also help counter Russian disinformation and propaganda narratives and support independent media.\n\nAdditional humanitarian assistance and food security funding will be included as well, to the tune of $3 billion, including “wheat and other commodities” for those in need, per the official. Part of that funding will go to job training, mental health services and resources for US school districts to help support Ukrainians arriving in the US and other efforts to support Ukrainian refugees and the countries providing them sanctuary.\n\nIt also includes targeted funding “to address economic disruptions at home and around the world due to Putin’s aggression,” which will help increase US production of food crops like soybeans, as well as funding to allow the use of the Defense Production Act to expand US production of critical reserves of minerals and other materials disrupted by the war.\n\n“It’s going to help support American farmers produce more crops like wheat and oil seed, which is good for rural America, good for the American consumer and good for the world,” Biden said.\n\nThe President announced last week the US would send an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine. The President said the package included heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers – longer-range weapons – and 144,000 rounds of ammo for those howitzers and more tactical drones.\n\nThe US had earlier this month announced another roughly $800 million security assistance package. That package included Mi-17 helicopters, Switchblade drones, protective equipment to guard against chemical attacks, Javelin anti-tank missiles, M113 armored personnel carriers, counter-artillery radars and body armor and helmets.\n\nHolding Russian oligarchs to account\n\nThe President said another one of his proposals would strengthen US law enforcement capabilities to seize property linked to Russia’s kleptocracy.\n\n“It’s going to create new expedited procedures for forfeiture and seizure of these properties and it’s going to ensure that when the oligarchs assets are sold off, funds can be used directly to remedy the harm Russia caused and help rebuild Ukraine,” Biden said.\n\nThe package – developed through an interagency process including the Treasury Department, Justice Department, State Department and Commerce Department – will “establish new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine and further strengthen related law enforcement tools,” the White House said in a fact sheet.\n\nOne element of the package would streamline the federal government’s efforts for seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs by creating a new administrative process through Treasury and the Justice Department “for the forfeiture of property in the United States that is owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs and that has a connection to specified unlawful conduct.” It would make it a criminal offense for people to “knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government.”\n\nThe proposal would also help direct proceeds from “forfeited funds related to corruption, sanctions and export control violations, and other specified offenses to remediate harms of Russian aggression toward Ukraine,” with the Justice Department, Treasury and State working together on these efforts. Earlier this week, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Biden administration would support legislation allowing for some of the proceeds from assets the DOJ seizes from Russian oligarchs “to go directly to Ukraine.”\n\nThe proposed package would allow for “forfeiture of property that Russian oligarchs can use to facilitate the evasion of sanctions,” a shift from the current US law which only allows for the US to forfeit the proceeds of sanctions violations. It also would categorize sanctions evasion as “racketeering activity,” extend the statute of limitations for pursuing money laundering prosecutions based on foreign offense from five to 10 years, and would enhance the US ability to work with allies and partners to recover assets linked to foreign corruption.\n\nOfficials said the Department of Justice has the authority to seize assets involved in criminal wrongdoing. They said they were seeking from Congress an “expanded and expedited administrative process” that would allow for the forfeiture of property.\n\nPeople with an interest in the property will be able to conduct judicial review and other safeguards to ensure due process, but the first official said the administration feels “confident” the set-up will satisfy constitutional requirements.\n\nWhile members have agreed that more money for Ukraine is necessary, it’s still not clear how the supplemental would move swiftly through Congress nor is it clear how quickly this proposal on oligarchs could move. A likely path would be to tie the two pieces of legislation together, but Republican and Democratic leaders are in the early stages of talks on how to pass the broader funding for Ukraine.\n\nAsked whether the Ukraine funding should move alongside new money for the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, a second official said, “it certainly makes sense for them to move together,” but declined to get ahead of the legislative process. Biden said he doesn’t care if his administration’s requests for Covid funding and aid to Ukraine are tied together or in separate pieces of legislation as long as Congress approves both.\n\n“I don’t care how they tie – how they do it,” Biden told reporters on Thursday. “I’m sending them both up. I mean, I they can do it separately or together, but we need them both.”\n\nHowever, his letter to Congress requesting the Ukraine funding suggested that the Covid assistance and Ukraine support be tied together: “To avoid needless deaths in the United States and around the world, I urge the Congress to include this much needed, life-saving Covid funding as part of this supplemental funding request,” the letter states.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Arlette Saenz Betsy Klein Kevin Liptak", "Kate Sullivan", "Arlette Saenz", "Betsy Klein", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/politics/biden-republicans-infrastructure-law/index.html", "title": "Biden calls out Republicans who took credit for infrastructure ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday criticized Republican lawmakers who voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill last year but have taken credit for projects made possible by the $1.2 trillion law.\n\n“We got a little help from Republicans – but not a lot – but enough to get it passed. But the truth is, there are a lot more Republicans taking credit for that bill than who actually voted for it,” Biden said at a Democratic National Committee reception in Maryland, another stop for the President as he picks up his campaigning less than two months ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n“I see them out there, ‘And now we’re going to build this new bridge here, we’re all for it. And by the way, this new road, and we’re going to have an internet that going to be all the way,’ the President said, changing his tone of voice for his impression of the Republicans. “I love them, man. They ain’t got no shame.”\n\nBiden did not name any Republican lawmakers in his speech, but a recent review by CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” found at least 14 congressional Republicans who voted against the bill have tried to take credit for projects made possible by it.\n\nIowa Democrat Liz Mathis, who is trying to unseat Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson, recently called out Hinson for claiming in a statement that she “helped lead a bipartisan group” to “prioritize funding for these essential upgrades” despite opposing the bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Hinson said in a statement to CNN that the congresswoman opposed the infrastructure package “because it was tied to trillions of other spending in the House.”\n\n“Since the bill was signed into law, this money was going to be spent regardless. If there’s federal money on the table she is, of course, going to do everything she can to make sure it is reinvested in Iowa. That’s why she worked with a bipartisan group of her colleagues in asking the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize NESP construction along the Upper Mississippi River,” the spokesperson said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas claimed in a post on his website in January that he secured $75 million for a creek restoration project in his district that came from the infrastructure bill despite voting against the bill. Gonzales had also said the infrastructure bill would “only make matters worse and hold our country back.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida also voted against the bill but in January toured a new embankment in the Everglades and tried to take credit for “securing an unprecedented $1 billion for Everglades restoration, the largest single amount ever allocated by the federal government.”\n\nCNN previously reached out to the lawmakers for comment.\n\nThe review by “The Lead” found other congressional Republicans who opposed the bill but have tried to take credit for it include: Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama, Rep. Michelle Steel of California, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, Rep. Pete Stauber of Minnesota, Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, Rep. Rob Wittman of Virginia and Rep. Ken Calvert of California.\n\nThe infrastructure law was a major bipartisan victory for the President and congressional Democrats, and 19 Republican senators and 13 House Republicans voted for the bill. The law invests $550 billion of new federal funding in America’s infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways.\n\nThe President last year criticized Republican lawmakers who touted parts of the Covid-19 emergency relief law that benefit their constituents, saying, “Some people have no shame.”\n\nUnlike the infrastructure law, no Republican in Congress voted for the American Rescue Plan. Biden noted in a speech in May that several Republicans were touting portions of the $1.9 trillion package that had gone toward their home districts. He did not name any of the Republicans in his speech but held up a piece of paper with names of lawmakers and the parts of the law they had promoted.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/politics/white-house-covid-warning/index.html", "title": "White House warns the US can't buy updated Covid-19 vaccines 'for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhite House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha warned Wednesday that without more funding from Congress the US will not be able to buy enough Covid-19 vaccines for every American who wants an updated shot later this year.\n\nScientists are working to develop new vaccines that would offer additional protection from infection and severe illness from new variants, including the possibility of a bivalent vaccine, a vaccine that would combine a currently approved vaccine with an Omicron-specific vaccine, for example. The US Food and Drug Administration could make a decision as soon as next month based on data from manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer for distribution in the fall.\n\n“We’re in the middle of developing new vaccines, potentially bivalent vaccines, the FDA is going to be looking at the data on this and making decisions. Our expectation is that we’ll probably get a new generation of vaccines or certainly we need to plan for that,” Jha said Wednesday.\n\nJha continued, “I want to make sure we have enough resources that we can buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one. I think that is absolutely critical. We do not have the resources to do that right now. So, without additional funding from Congress, we will not be able to buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one, once these new generation of vaccines come out in the fall and winter.”\n\nThe comments came as top Biden administration officials gave an update on the state of the Covid-19 pandemic, boosters, treatments, and funding during Wednesday’s Covid response team briefing, the first such briefing in more than a month. Jha, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky spoke at the briefing. It was Jha’s first appearance at a Covid briefing since assuming his new role last month.\n\nIt comes as cases are rising nationwide, something officials were expected to detail during the briefing. US Covid-19 deaths recently exceeded 1 million, a milestone marked by President Joe Biden last week.\n\nThe Biden administration requested $22.5 billion in additional funding for US Covid response, but that bill faces an uncertain path forward in Congress.\n\nThere have been “preliminary conversations” with vaccine manufacturers, Jha said, but negotiations have not yet begun without the additional funding resources from Congress.\n\n“Every day we wait, every week we wait, we just fall a little further behind in line,” Jha said, adding that the administration is “very committed” to finding resources from other programs to pay for at least some of these updated vaccines.\n\n“I think if Congress abdicate its responsibilities, it is not acceptable for us in the administration to go into the fall and winter with zero vaccines. I am confident we will find money to be able to get some Americans vaccinated, maybe just the highest risk, we don’t know, but these are not decisions we want to be having to make. We want Congress to step up,” he said.\n\nJha also said that nearly 8.5 million US households have ordered rapid tests for Covid-19 in the first few days after the federal government made a third round of free tests available earlier this week. There are approximately 122.3 million households in the US, according to the US Census bureau.\n\nRapid tests, Jha told reporters, are a “very effective way” to reduce the virus’ spread. Jha characterized the demand since Monday as “impressive,” although the 8 million households represents only a small fraction of total US households. When the White House announced the new round of tests earlier this week, it said 350 million free tests had been shipped to US households to date.\n\nThe government first launched the website to allow for the order of free tests in January. Americans were able to order their second round of tests in March. During both rounds, people could order a maximum of four tests per household. This third round doubles that.\n\nThese tests were paid for by the Covid-19 relief bill passed by Congress last year.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}]}

What to know", "text": "The 2024 Paris Olympics are quickly approaching, with more than 10,000 athletes set to converge later this summer for what organizers hope will be a spectacular showcase of France − and a return to normalcy.\n\nAfter the past two editions of the Games took place under the specter of COVID-19, with no or few fans permitted to attend, the Paris Olympics are expected to feature full stadiums and an extravagant opening ceremony along the Seine River. It will also be more convenient for U.S. television viewers, who will be able to watch primetime finals in key sports during the middle of the day.\n\nHere's everything else you need to know about the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhen do the Olympics start in Paris?\n\nThe first competitions of the 2024 Paris Olympics will be group stage matches in men's soccer and rugby on July 24. The first men's soccer game will kick off at 3 p.m. local time (or 9 a.m. ET). Although a handful of other events in archery, team handball, soccer and rugby will follow the next day, the Games don't formally begin until the opening ceremony, which is slated for July 26.\n\nWhat is the Olympics 2024 schedule?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics run from the aforementioned opening ceremony on July 26 to the closing ceremony on Aug. 11. As usual, gymnastics and swimming will be among the key sports in the first half of the schedule, with track and field among the most popular sports following in the second half. Here are the dates for just a few of the most high-profile events at the Paris Olympics:\n\nJuly 30: Women's gymnastics (team final)\n\nWomen's gymnastics (team final) August 1: Women's gymnastics (individual all-around final)\n\nWomen's gymnastics (individual all-around final) August 3: Women's swimming (800-meter freestyle); Women's track and field (100-meter final)\n\nWomen's swimming (800-meter freestyle); Women's track and field (100-meter final) August 4: Men's track and field (100-meter final)\n\nMen's track and field (100-meter final) August 10 : Men's basketball (gold-medal game); Women's soccer (gold-medal game)\n\n: Men's basketball (gold-medal game); Women's soccer (gold-medal game) August 11: Women's basketball (gold-medal game)\n\nRead the complete sport-by-sport schedule for the Paris Games here.\n\nHow can I watch the Olympics?\n\nSimilar to other recent editions of the Games, the Paris Olympics will be shown on NBC and its affiliated channels. The network has said it will televise at least nine hours of daytime Olympic coverage on NBC for the duration of the Games, including live broadcasts of key finals. It will also brodcast every sport and every event on streaming service Peacock. The complete broadcasting schedule, including times and TV channels for specific events, has yet to be announced.\n\nWhat are the new sports for Paris 2024?\n\nTechnically, there will only be one: Breaking. The sport, which is more commonly known as breakdancing, will be contested at the Olympic Games for the first time ever in Paris, with men's and women's fields of 20 competitors each.\n\nThree other sports will be back after debuting at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics: Climbing, skateboarding and surfing.\n\nThe next edition of the Summer Games, in Los Angeles in 2028, will mark the debut of cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony?\n\nAt most editions of the Olympic Games, the opening cermony is held in the city's largest stadium. Paris, however, decided to do things a little bit differently.\n\nThe Paris 2024 opening ceremony will be the first in Summer Olympics history to be staged outside a stadium, with athletes floating down barges on the Seine River rather than marching into a venue. The barges will travel nearly four miles over the course of the ceremony, beginning near the Austerlitz bridge in the eastern part of downtown Paris and ending to the west, near the Trocadéro.\n\nThe opening ceremony promises to be visually striking, but it also poses security challenges. Paris 2024 organizers have recruited thousands of security guards to staff the event, and only 300,000 spectators will be permitted to attend.\n\nHow many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will be the third iteration of the Games hosted in Paris but the first in exactly a century. The French capital previously hosted the Summer Games in 1924 and 1900. Paris will join London as the only cities to host three editions of the Olympic Games. Los Angeles will become the third when it hosts the subsequent iteration of the Summer Games in 2028.\n\nWhere are the Paris Olympic venues?\n\nMany of the events and competitions for the Paris Games will take place in the heart of Paris − and some will even be held at or near some of the French capital's iconic landmarks.\n\nFencing and taekwondo events, for example, will be held in historic Grand Palais. Equestrian will be among the sports contested at the Palace of Versailles outside the city. And beach volleyball matches might have the most dramatic backdrop of all: They'll take place in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWill Messi play in the Olympics?\n\nArgentina's under-23 coach Javier Mascherano has said the \"door is open\" for superstar Lionel Messi to take the field in Paris, though it appears unlikely.\n\nMen's soccer rosters at the Olympics largely consist of under-23 players, but each country is permitted to field three overage players. Messi, the 2022 World Cup champion and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, could theoretically fill one of those slots. However, he has previously expressed interest in competing for Argentina at the Copa America this summer, and that event ends about two weeks before the Paris Games begin.\n\nIs Simone Biles competing in Paris?\n\nThe U.S. won't officially name its Olympic gymnastics team until late June or early July, after the Olympic trials, but Biles is a lock to make it. The four-time Olympic gold medalist took a brief hiatus after the Tokyo Games but returned to form last year, winning four golds at the world championships in Belgium. She remains the most decorated and dominant gymnast on the planet.\n\nBiles will be one of several big names expected to represent Team USA in Paris alongside Katie Ledecky (swimming), Noah Lyles (track and field) and Sha'Carri Richardson (track and field). Several men's and women's basketball stars, including LeBron James and Kelsey Plum, have also expressed interest in participating.\n\nWho is on the Team USA roster?\n\nMany athletes will not book their tickets to Paris until later this summer, when gymnastics, swimming, track and other sports will hold their Olympic trials. But as of Feb. 20, more than 30 athletes had already qualified in sports ranging from climbing and surfing to shooting and sailing.\n\nCarissa Moore (surfing) and Mary Tucker (shooting) were among the 2021 Tokyo medalists who quickly secured their sports on Team USA this summer. Click here for a full list of Team USA qualifiers, courtesy of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\nWhere are the next Olympics?\n\nFollowing Paris, the next edition of the Olympics will come in early 2026, when Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo will host the Winter Games. The next edition of the Summer Games will be held in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nIn fact, the International Olympic Committee has already lined up future Olympic hosts through 2034. Brisbane will host the 2032 Summer Games, and the French Alps (2030) and Salt Lake City (2034) are slated to host the next two Winter Games, though their role as host cities will not be officially confirmed until this summer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2024/02/07/olympic-women-s-basketball-qualifiers-set-to-begin-around-the-world/72504886007/", "title": "Olympic women's basketball qualifiers set to begin around the world", "text": "DOUG FEINBERG\n\nAP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. and France have already qualified for the Paris Olympics this summer in women's basketball. The 10 other spots are up for grabs this week in four qualifying tournaments that are spread throughout the world.\n\nBelgium, China, Hungary and Brazil will each host four teams in a round-robin style format that begins Thursday. The top three teams in Brazil and Hungary will advance to the Olympics this summer.\n\nIn Belgium and China, the top two teams other then France and the U.S. will qualify for the Games as well.\n\nThe Americans sent a WNBA filled roster to the tournament in Belgium, where they will play the host nation on Thursday and then Senegal and Nigeria in the other two contests this weekend. The U.S. team is missing Olympians A'ja Wilson, Brittney Griner and Chelsea Gray, who all have a very strong shot to be on the team in Paris.\n\nWhile the U.S. is using a bunch of pros on its roster, the teams playing in Brazil have a few college players on them. South Carolina star Kamilla Cardoso is missing the No. 1 Gamecocks next two games to compete with the Brazilian team. UCLA forward Lina Sontag is playing with the German team and Angela Dugalic with the Serbian squad.\n\nWashington State's Charlisse Leger-Walker was set to play for New Zealand as well before she tore her right ACL late last month.\n\nHere are a few other things to look for in the qualifying tournaments:\n\nNigeria will play Senegal on the opening night in Belgium and the winner most likely will be the Olympic representative for the continent. African teams have struggled at the Olympics since first participating in 1996, winning just once in the 2004 Games. Nigeria beat South Korea in that contest.\n\nNigeria did have a major breakthrough at the 2018 World Cup, making the quarterfinals before falling to the U.S. It was the first time that any African country had reached the quarterfinals.\n\nLauren Jackson’s international basketball career with the Australian national team will have at least one more chapter to it. The 42-year-old three-time WNBA MVP, who has won four Olympic medals with Australia, is part of the Opals team that will play in Brazil.\n\nJackson capped off an incredible comeback at the World Cup in 2022, helping the host nation win a bronze medal. She scored 30 points in that game to help Australia rout Canada 95-65. She had retired from playing in 2016 after knee injuries derailed her career, missing the Rio Olympics. She slowly returned, playing in a domestic Australian league the last few years.\n\nGermany, which is led by the Sabally sisters, Satou and Nyara, is trying to earn its first trip to the Olympics. It would be an extra boost for the country that is hosting the 2026 World Cup.\n\nFormer Canada coach Lisa Thomaidis took over the German team in April that is playing in Brazil with Australia and Serbia.\n\nCanada guard Kia Nurse said on a conference call that she would miss the tournament because of a minor injury. ... With France already having a berth in the Olympics locked up and China hosting the qualifying tournament it is most likely going to be the winner of the game between Puerto Rico and New Zealand that gets the other bid from that area.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/07/26/2024-paris-summer-olympics-usa-athletes-to-watch/70444024007/", "title": "Olympics 2024: Team USA hopefuls to know ahead of Paris ...", "text": "The 2024 Summer Olympics are exactly one year away, with the world's best athletes set to converge in Paris for what they − and all of us − hope will be a return to normalcy.\n\nAfter the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Olympics were hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with strict masking requirements and the complete or partial absence of spectators at stadiums, Paris 2024 organizers are hoping these Games will represent a fresh start. And for a wave of up-and-coming athletes, they will also represent a new opportunity.\n\nTeam USA is likely to feature plenty of well-known stars, from Noah Lyles and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone on the track to Katie Ledecky in the pool and maybe even Simone Biles in the gym. Yet as Paris 2024 beckons, here are 10 American athletes on the rise, whom you might not already know − each of them in contention to not only make Team USA, but also perhaps win their first Olympic medal in Paris.\n\nGriffin Colapinto (men's surfing)\n\nColapinto didn't qualify for surfing's Olympic debut at the 2021 Tokyo Games, but he'll be in Paris next summer after cementing himself as the top male surfer in the U.S. The 24-year-old California native was the second American athlete to officially book his ticket to the 2024 Olympics earlier this month, by virtue of his performances to date in the World Surf League. He was ranked No. 1 in the world earlier this year and figures to challenge the Brazilian men for a spot on the Olympic podium.\n\nYianni Diakomihalis (men's wrestling)\n\nThe U.S. has won multiple medals in men's freestyle wrestling at each of the past three Olympics, including a whopping five medals in Tokyo. And Diakomihalis is one of the country's top up-and-coming talents. The 24-year-old won four NCAA titles at Cornell and silver at the 2022 world championships in Belgrade, Serbia. If he can qualify for Paris, which is no certainty given the depth of the American field at his weight class, he could have a strong chance of earning an Olympic medal.\n\nNic Fink (men's swimming)\n\nFink, 30, has been competing for more than a decade but only recently turned the corner to become a legitimate Olympic medal threat in the breaststroke. After placing fifth in his only event at the Tokyo Games (200 meters) he went on to win four medals at the 2022 world championships and national titles in two breaststroke events earlier this year. If he can maintain his place as the top American man in the breaststroke, he could very well have a shot at multiple medals in Paris, including relay opportunities.\n\nJimmer Fredette (men's 3-on-3 basketball)\n\nFredette is another veteran looking to make his mark at the Olympic Games for the first time. After spending a few years playing professionally in China and Greece, the BYU legend has latched on with Team USA's 3-on-3 program, helping it win silver at the most recent FIBA World Cup. It seems highly unlikely that Team USA will fail to qualify for Paris n this event, like it did ahead of the Tokyo Games. So if Fredette can keep his place on the team, he'll have a realistic shot at making an Olympic podium.\n\nKatie Grimes (women's swimming)\n\nGrimes was the youngest member of Team USA at the 2021 Tokyo Games at age 15, and it's since become clear that those Olympics will certainly not be her last. Still just 17, Grimes finished second behind Ledecky in the 1500-meter freestyle at both the 2022 world championships and the most recent U.S. championships, while also turning in strong performances at both events in the 400-meter individual medley.\n\nAnna Hall (women's track and field)\n\nThe heptathlon isn't one of track and field's most glamorous events, but Hall appears destined to blossom into one of its stars. She won a bronze medal at the 2022 world championships before even turning pro, which she did late last year, and her score at a meet earlier this year (6988) was among the highest ever. Among Americans, only the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee has scored higher.\n\nShilese Jones (women's gymnastics)\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Paris Games will be held on Jones' 22nd birthday − and, if she can maintain her 2022 form, she'll without question be in contention to be there. Jones won silver in the individual all-around and uneven bars at the 2022 world championships, behind reigning Olympic gold medalist Rebeca Andrade. And just as importantly, she played a key role on the U.S. team that won gold there. Jones' primary challenge will be making the Olympic team. If she does, she'll more than likely return home with a medal.\n\nVictor Montalvo (men's breaking)\n\nBreaking, or breakdancing as it is more commonly known, will be making its Olympic debut in Paris. And Montalvo, who competes as B-boy Victor, is arguably the top American man in the sport. More than a decade after making his competitive debut, Montalvo had a banner year in 2022, with wins at the World Games and Red Bull BC One, plus a bronze medal at the most recent world championships.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson (women's track and field)\n\nRichardson might be the most well-known athlete on this list, and she likely would already own an Olympic medal had she not tested positive for marijuana following the Olympic trials in 2021. After falling into a bit of a slump later that year and into 2022, the LSU product has re-established herself as a world-class talent in 2023. Only six women in history have run the 100-meter dash faster than she did earlier this month (10.71 seconds), and she is favored to win at least one medal at next month's world championships.\n\nSophia Smith (women's soccer)\n\nGiven the youth movement within the U.S. women's soccer team, there are several up-and-coming stars who could be chasing their first Olympic medal in Paris. Smith, 22, is among the most prominent. A natural and persistent scorer, she scored 11 goals for the U.S. national team and a club single-season record 14 more for the Portland Thorns in 2022. The ongoing World Cup could prove to be her coming out party.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/06/28/us-olympic-swimmer-erica-sullivan-talks-pride-month/70344389007/", "title": "Erica Sullivan: U.S. Olympic swimmer talks representation, Pride ...", "text": "U.S. Olympic swimmer Erica Sullivan has her eyes set on Paris 2024.\n\nIt would be the second Olympic games for Sullivan, who won a silver medal in the 1500-meter freestyle at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, finishing behind fellow American Katie Ledecky.

Sullivan, recipient of the Human Rights Campaign's \"Rising Star\" honor, is ready to make waves.\n\nTOKYO OLYMPICS:Katie Ledecky wins gold medal in 1,500 freestyle, US teammate Erica Sullivan takes silver\n\nUSA TODAY Sports caught up with Sullivan during Pride month to talk about the importance and pressures of representation, the upcoming Olympic games, her mental health journey, her late father John Sullivan and her philanthropy.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nQ: You won a silver medal in the 1500m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. What was it like competing as your authentic self on the biggest stage in the world?\n\n\"I feel like it’s really special to me – just being able to be there. I feel like a lot of people found out that I made that Olympic team being gay and I think it drew a lot more eyes on me on how I was performing in Tokyo. There was a little bit of added pressure, but honestly I just wanted to make sure I was doing it for a good cause.\"\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the pressure you felt? Did you feel like you had to perform well?\n\n\"I feel like I want to be a good role model for those I represent. I just don’t want to be viewed in a negative light and have that be the representation of swimmers in our community. That was a little bit of pressure that I put on myself... I thought not only was it a way to represent the queer community but it’s also a way to educate the straight community.\"\n\nQ: Is swimming an escape or safe space for you?\n\n\"Yes...especially with it being a sport where it’s kind of individualized. You are kind of looking at a black line the majority of practice. I feel like it’s a time where I can really be with my thoughts and have some quiet and a lot of time to think while I’m training.\"\n\nQ: You have been open about overcoming mental health barriers. Can you share a little about your journey?\n\n\"My dad died in 2017 around the same time that I came out. I couldn't really process what was happening at the time because I was so young. I had to go to therapy about six months later because I hadn’t really processed anything and I was going through a really strong depressive episode, including some post-traumatic stress. So I did a lot of therapy and I worked on myself a lot.\n\n\"At the times where I was my lowest, I had to just hold on to hope that it was going to get better. Because of what I went through then, I feel like (mental health) is not anything that should be taken for granted. It does affect the way you perform. Even though you think my dad dying is so separate from my sport, it does overlap and it is hard to keep those identities of myself separate.\"\n\nQ: Has improving your mental health helped you improve other areas of your life, including swim?\n\n\"So much. I’m still in therapy today. I go every week. It honestly comes down to solving the problem before it elevates. It’s proactively working rather than a reactive approach. And I recommend it to everyone if it is affordable or feasible for you. There is always something that you have suppressed at some point in your life or you could currently be going through that could turn into an issue in the future. If you are currently getting the help that you need, it allows you to process all the emotions around it at the moment.\"\n\nQ: Your father John Sullivan was your role model, having swam collegiately. What was it like having his guidance on your swim career?\n\n\"It’s really important to have the perspective of a D-1 athlete who has gone through the sport, especially in your early years. Not to take things as seriously as I did at such a young age. Simple things like getting disqualified when I was eight and like taking me to ice cream instead of letting me beat myself up. Showing the importance of hard work and how it does pay off in your career. I think he really instilled that in me at a young age, and to honestly keep sports fun. I’m really appreciative of him creating those roots for me around the sport.\"\n\nQ: How do you continue to honor your father’s legacy after he died of esophageal cancer in 2017?\n\n\"Different ways. With my Dad, he was really close to his collegiate teammates, very similar to how I am with my collegiate teammates right now. (Sullivan swims competitively at the University of Texas.) And so creating a relationship with my dad’s former teammates has been really important to me. I’m headed out to Wisconsin – my dad went to the University of Wisconsin – this summer to go hang out with some of his teammates. It’s sort of like a mass family vacation... Taking that time to make sure doing things he would have really appreciated. I’m excited to do that this summer and be there with the people that I love.\"\n\nQ: You created the Longhorn Pride Alliance. What went into creating that Student-Athlete Organization and why was it important to you?\n\n\"Longhorn Pride Alliance was actually revamped. It had kind of just died out. Leadership had all left, everyone in the club graduated. It had been dead for two years at this point. So I heard there was a rundown club for queer student-athletes and I talked to our student-athletic academic organizer and said, ‘Hey, what do we have to do to bring this club back?’ And so me and three other student-athletes started the club last year.\n\n\"It really creates a sense of community within the student-athlete realm at the (University of Texas). At UT, we are all so divided by sport that having another identity to bring people of different sports together has been really, really fun. The club introduced me to the world of golfers, rowers, tennis players and football. Bringing those kinds of people in creates conversation and relationships that would have never happened without this organization. I was really happy we were able to start that up again. I’m excited to see what we can do in the coming years to grow the club and hopefully do some good within our community.\"\n\nQ: Pride month is 30 days in celebration. What advice would you give to support your community year-round?\n\n\"Just be an ally year-round. The most important way to be there with someone is personal relationships. If you know someone in your day-to-day life who is coming out and struggling with it, be that person they can talk to and feel comfortable around... You can be an escape for them. I feel like that’s the best way to be an ally year-round. Also I like supporting businesses that support policies that help the queer community… Support queer businesses.\"\n\nQ: Do you have plans for Paris 2024? How do you keep that balance with swimming competitively and advocacy?\n\n\"I’m definitely going to make the team. I want to make one more and I’ll probably retire after Paris. So I kind of want to get one more in the books. I’m not creating any crazy goals. I just kind of want to see what happens and see where the journey takes me.\"\n\n\"It’s a lot being a student athlete, trying to train for the coming Olympics and on top of that, doing all the stuff on top of school and swim. It’s a lot. I’m a pretty notorious coffee addict to keep myself going these days. I would just say prioritizing things. As seasons come and go, I have different priorities. So you know coming up to any big meets I have, swimming is pretty much my number one priority. There are a couple weeks where I have to prioritize school if I have an exam coming up. Any free time I have an opportunity to help people, I try to make that a priority.\"\n\nQ: Speedo released their pride collection. What is your favorite piece from the collection?\n\n\"I signed on with Speedo about a year and a half ago. I have been so grateful for all the opportunities they have provided me. I feel like so many swim lines have their typical pride campaign come out in the month of June, but Speedo is one of the very few companies that have an LGBTQ+ swimmer representing said line. They heard me. I had some requests about how I wanted to make it a priority that they donated to an LGBTQ charity and they gladly listened. They actually came to me about what charity I want them to donate too. I chose (Human Rights Campaign) just because they have done so much good as of late. I think Speedo ended up donating a sum of $40,000, which is absolutely amazing and I’m so grateful. The people at Speedo have made it a priority to support you year-round and not a lot of companies go out of their way to do that. They have truly put in the effort to make sure queer voices are heard within the sport.\n\n\"I learned how to swim in a Speedo suit. I feel like I used Speedo in my up-and-coming years to become a collegiate athlete and an Olympic athlete and them coming to me now and being like we now need your help for representation in the swim community is just something I will never take for granted and it's so surreal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/01/01/snoop-dogg-oympics-2024-commentator/72078127007/", "title": "Snoop Dogg set to return as Olympic commentator for Paris 2024 ...", "text": "The start of 2024 means the Olympic year has officially arrived, with the Paris Summer Games starting on July 26.\n\nIt also means Snoop Dogg is back as an Olympic commentator.\n\nNBCUniversal announced Sunday that the rapper and entertainer will provide regular updates and speak with host Mike Tirico during prime time coverage throughout the Games for NBC and Peacock.

They both were suspended from most Olympic sports a year earlier over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe process is run by the sports federations which organize their own qualifying competitions. The IOC wants them to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes who are employed by the military or security services or who posted on social media supporting the war. The multitude of different rules across the Games’ 32 sports mean exact numbers of those with “neutral” status are hard to verify.\n\nThe IOC says six Russians and five Belarusians have already qualified for Paris. There are many more qualifying events to come.\n\nThe IOC will appoint “independent analysts” for its own vetting, spokesman Mark Adams said last week.\n\n“You can have some confidence that those people who have qualified will have already been through one process and then will be going through a second process run by the IOC but using an independent organization,” Adams said.\n\nRussian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Wednesday he expected “much stricter” conditions and suggested the extra vetting meant the IOC “doesn't fully trust the international sports federations.”\n\nWHICH SPORTS ARE RUSSIANS COMPETING IN?\n\nCombat sports were especially enthusiastic about bringing back Russian competitors. Judo, fencing, wrestling and taekwondo led the way in admitting “neutral athletes” in 2023 and Russians have regularly competed in their Olympic qualifying events.\n\nDifferent Russian sports bodies have taken varying approaches to the “neutral athlete” system, and there hasn't been a final decision from the government. Putin expressed concern in December that the rules could leave too many of Russia’s top athletes “cut out” of the Games.\n\nInfluential gymnastics coach Valentina Rodionenko has told Russian media that Russia shouldn't enter World Cups unless the criteria are relaxed. International Gymnastics Federation records show it's granted “neutral” status to 30 people from Belarus including athletes, coaches and officials, but no Russians.\n\nThere are also no Russians expected to compete at the world swimming championships in Qatar next month, a key Olympic qualifier, though Belarus is set to send five swimmers.\n\nThe Russian governing bodies for gymnastics and swimming did not respond to a request for comment on whether any applications were filed for their athletes.\n\nRussia has skipped Olympic weightlifting qualifiers in protest at a demand to sign a declaration which includes a pledge “to abstain from expressing any support to the war.\" Belarus has competed in those events.\n\nTrack and field never lifted its ban on Russian athletes. The IOC is blocking Russia and Belarus from team sports such as soccer, basketball or volleyball because it argues their involvement should be in “individual” events only, not as part of squads representing the country. Tennis doubles or two-person rowing crews might be approved, though.\n\nUKRAINE'S CONCERNS\n\nAre sports federations following the rules? Ukraine says no.\n\nMore than 200 Ukrainian athletes including top soccer player Mykhailo Mudryk and high jump world champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh signed an open letter to French President Emmanuel Macron this month alleging three Russians who qualified for the Olympics as “neutrals” expressed support for the war.\n\n“Allowing athletes from aggressor countries, who openly support Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine, violates the fundamental ethical principles declared by the Olympic Charter,” the letter said.\n\nUkraine still opposes the IOC push for Russians to compete as neutrals but in July it dropped a policy that forced Ukrainian athletes to boycott events rather than compete against them.\n\nTwo Olympic gold medalists in taekwondo accused of posting on social media in support of the war were handed a “probation period” of three months by World Taekwondo but allowed to compete after that. United World Wrestling let three Olympic champions from Russia take part in its world championships because it judged they had been pressured into appearing at a pro-war rally in Moscow attended by Putin.\n\nSWITCHING NATIONALITY\n\nAt least some athletes from Russia — and who competed for Russia before the war — could be in Paris on the host French team.\n\nThere's European swimming champion Anastasiia Kirpichnikova, who switched allegiance from Russia to France in April, and Moscow-born Varvara Gracheva, who started representing France in June and has become France's second-highest ranked tennis player.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed.\n\n___\n\nAP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/02/02/2024-us-olympic-marathon-trials-favorites-tv/72440579007/", "title": "Everything you need to know for 2024 US Olympic marathon trials in ...", "text": "The buildup to this Saturday’s U.S. Olympic marathon trials in Orlando began with some tough news when Molly Seidel, the surprise bronze medalist from the Tokyo Games in 2021, pulled out Thursday due to a knee injury.\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, Seidel explained that the problems began about a month ago and that imaging revealed a broken patella and partially torn patellar tendon. Though she had been cross-training in hopes of being able to compete for a spot on the Olympic team, the 29-year old Notre Dame graduate had to accept reality and was “really (expletive) bummed” that she wouldn’t have a chance to make the team in Paris later this year.\n\n“I’ve done everything in my power over this last month to try to get myself to the line,” Seidel said. “But ultimately I got to this week and my knee hadn’t healed up enough and I knew I couldn’t race a marathon hard on it in its current state without really, really injuring myself.”\n\nSeidel, who ran her first-ever marathon at the 2020 trials, was the biggest story to come out of that event, which was contested just a couple weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic brought the country to a halt and delayed the Olympics by a year.\n\nThe circumstances this time around should be significantly more normal. Here are four things to know about the trials, which will be broadcast live on Peacock and the NBC streaming platforms at 10 a.m. Eastern and shown via tape delay on regular NBC beginning at noon.\n\nControversial location\n\nLast September, nearly 100 competitors signed and sent a letter to USA Track & Field raising concerns about a noon start time for a race being staged in Orlando, which has the potential to be hot and humid even in early February. Typically, elite marathoners consider temperatures in the 40-to-50 degree range to be ideal. Hotter mid-day conditions, on the other hand, can be dangerous. At the 2016 trials in Los Angeles, which were contested in 73 degree weather, third-place finisher Shalane Flanagan collapsed just past the finish line due to dehydration.\n\nBut not all competitors agreed that it was a concern. Des Linden, a 2012 and 2016 Olympian, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that she liked the noon start because of the better television window and that professional marathoners should be able to adapt.\n\nRegardless, a compromise was reached to start the race at 10 a.m. locally. And in the end, it shouldn’t be too much an issue: The forecast for the first-ever marathon trials held in Florida is calling for temperatures around 70 degrees or a little below for the race.\n\nHow to qualify for Paris\n\nIn an effort to cap both the men’s and women’s fields at 80 participants for the Summer Games, World Athletics changed the qualification system and made it much more complicated than previous Olympics where the top-three American finishers in the trials were guaranteed spots.\n\nNow, in order for countries to earn their maximum three spots in the field, the positions have to be “unlocked” based on running times between Nov. 6, 2022 and April 30, 2024, a top-five finish at a certain level of international competition or being among the top-80 in the World Athletics rankings.\n\nBut the confusing part is that the runners who “unlock” those spots won’t necessarily get them – they are granted to the federation, who can give them out however they choose. That's key for powerhouse countries like Kenya and Ethiopia, which dominate the sport but are limited to three entrants in the Olympics.\n\nThe bottom-line for the American team is that the top-three finishers Saturday on the women’s side will almost certainly be in Paris unless it is a shockingly slow race. But the men have only unlocked two spots thus far, as Conner Mantz and Clayton Young are the only ones who have hit the time standard.\n\nThe scenarios from there can get pretty complicated. If the top-three men all run the race in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 10 seconds or faster, the third spot will be unlocked and those three runners will make the Olympic team.\n\nBut if nobody other than Mantz or Young beats that threshold, then the two guaranteed Olympic team spots would go to the top-two finishers as long as they have run a certified marathon in 2:11:30 since the November 2022 cut-off date (including Saturday’s race). That means there’s a real possibility that either Mantz or Young could finish third on Saturday and not make the Olympics – even though their running times unlocked the Olympic spots for Team USA.\n\nThe third spot would then come down to other factors that might not get sorted out until May, but it might be difficult to unlock given that just one American man (Mantz) currently ranks in the top-200 and there’s not much time left to qualify. It’s worth noting that just seven American men have previously met the Olympic standard in their entire careers.\n\nThe other way to unlock the third spot for Paris is if someone other than Mantz or Young runs 2:08:10 or better, which would allow the top-three finishers to get in as long as they have hit the 2:11:30 time.\n\nSome critics would argue this isn’t the best way to choose an Olympic team for this particular event, as it puts everything on one performance – which may or may not translate to the conditions or type of course they’ll see in the Summer Games. The Orlando course, for instance, is far flatter and less difficult than what runners will see in Paris. For that reason, some countries like Kenya choose their team by committee rather than rely on the cut-and-dried results of an Olympic trial.\n\nWomen’s contenders\n\nDespite Seidel’s absence, this should be a strong race for the women, who have been consistently one-upping each other to set new American records during this Olympic cycle.\n\nJust as a point of comparison, 2020 trials winner Aliphine Tuliamuk ran the Atlanta course in 2:27:23. Emily Sisson, the highest-ranked American currently, easily beat that in the last two Chicago Marathons, running 2:18:29 and 2:22:09. The former snatched the North American record from Keira D’Amato, who ran 2:19:12 in winning the 2022 Houston Marathon.\n\nEven Tuliamuk, who is not considered one of the favorites this time around, lowered her personal best to 2:24:37 at the Boston Marathon last year.\n\nD’Amato was dealing with hip flexor issues at last year’s world championships but has been competing less and training more with an eye toward peaking in this race. Along with Sisson, they are the clear favorites to get two of the Olympic team spots if they run their respective races Saturday.\n\nLikely contenders for the third spot would be two-time Olympian Sally Kipyego, who has not run a marathon since 2021, and Betsy Saina, who ran the 10,000 meters for Kenya at the Rio Games and won the Sydney Marathon last September after switching to Team USA. Former gymnast Gabi Rooker, a relative newcomer to the sport, was impressive last October running the Chicago Marathon in 2:24:35. And the sentimental favorite will be 37-year old Jenny Simpson, a world champion and Olympic bronze medalist in the 1,500 meters who is competing in her hometown but does not have marathon experience.\n\nMen’s contenders\n\nThis is considered a pretty wide-open race, but any discussion about American men’s marathon runners must start with 37-year-old Galen Rupp. In Tokyo, where he participated in his fourth Olympics, Rupp finished a commendable eighth to back up the bronze medal he won in Rio five years earlier. He also has a silver in the 10,000 meters from the London Games.\n\nRupp may be a little older and slightly past his prime, but he’s one of the few who have proven that he can handle the mental pressure of these big races and is still posting solid results like 14th place in the Houston Half Marathon last month and eighth place in the Chicago Marathon last October, just missing the Olympic cut-off time by 38 seconds.\n\nPaul Chelimo, a two-time Olympic medalist in the 5,000 meters, is making his marathon debut here but has such a strong record that other runners will undoubtedly be keeping an eye on his pace – especially on a flat course that might favor people with track backgrounds..\n\nBecause of the times they’ve recorded, Mantz and Young will be the top two to watch here. But if they don’t have their best day, the door will be open for someone like Scott Fauble, who ran 2:09:44 in last year’s Boston Marathon, or Futsum Zienasellassie, who ran a strong 10th (2:12:09) in the New York Marathon last fall.\n\nThough he’s not expected to contend, it’s worth noting that Abdi Abdirahman, who made Team USA in Tokyo, will be the oldest entrant in U.S. trials history at age 47.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2024/02/20/wings-forward-sabally-has-shoulder-procedure-after-getting-hurt-with-germany-in-olympic-qualifier/72677793007/", "title": "Wings forward Sabally has shoulder procedure after getting hurt with ...", "text": "AP\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Dallas Wings forward Satou Sabally had what the team called a shoulder procedure after she got hurt playing for Germany in an Olympic qualifying tournament earlier this month.\n\nThe Wings didn't elaborate on what procedure she had Tuesday, and said no timeline had been set for her return.

Ron DeSantis has been on a high-profile crusade to remove diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the state’s colleges. Funding for DEI – and a collection of topics lumped together as critical race theory – “will wither on the vine,” DeSantis said earlier this year as he unveiled legislation that would cut such programs.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature is expected to pass the bill as well as other proposals to restrict how race and identity are discussed and handled in educational settings. Observers worry such laws, if passed, could overturn or at least chill efforts at schools and colleges to foster a sense of belonging among all students and improve access for marginalized groups.\n\nFlorida is hardly the only state to face a DEI crackdown, however.\n\nAt least two dozen bills on the question have been introduced in 15 states this year, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, all seeking to somehow undo DEI efforts at colleges. In some states, institutions are already rolling back their DEI programs in anticipation of a crackdown.\n\nHere’s a look at some state efforts to remove DEI from public colleges.\n\nBoard shake-ups, tenure and money:How conservatives are reshaping colleges\n\nIowa: New DEI programs on pause at state universities\n\nA bill advancing through the Iowa House would effectively require state universities to disband their DEI programs. Specifically, the legislation would prohibit the the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa from spending any state or private money on DEI officers, providing an expansive definition for such work, including “any effort to promote or promulgate trainings, programming, or activities designed or implemented with reference to race, color, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation.”\n\nMariana Gonzalez, a senior at Iowa State and first-generation college student, said the bill \"shows a lack of empathy from the Iowa GOP.\"\n\nFlorida Black sororities, frats fear future amid DEI attack:Bill sponsor sees 'zero impact'\n\nIt \"threatens the ability of someone like me to succeed at an institution like Iowa State,\" Gonzalez told USA TODAY, and \"rips a system of support out from under\" us.\n\nThe native Iowan said she wants to stay in the state after graduation but is now looking elsewhere because of its political direction. \"If this legislation actually passes, I can’t even begin to imagine the detrimental impact it will have on our universities,\" Gonzalez said. \"No one will want to come to spend thousands of dollars to study at unaccepting and intolerant colleges, much less stay in the state.\"\n\nSeparately, the president of Iowa’s Board of Regents announced last week that the body will conduct “a comprehensive study and review” of all DEI programs at the state's public universities. Schools, he advised, should hold off on implementing any new DEI programs until the review is complete.\n\nA red state trend:GOP lawmakers take aim at Iowa university diversity programs\n\nMissouri: Bill targets diversity statements\n\nDespite significant opposition, a Missouri bill that would prohibit state universities from requiring diversity statements recently passed out of committee and now faces the House.\n\nThe legislation would ban public higher education institutions from stipulating that prospective employees submit statements in support of DEI.\n\nMore colleges are offering DEI degrees:Why? Demand for diversity expertise is growing.\n\nSouth Carolina: Lawmakers probe DEI at public colleges, universities\n\nAs part of broader budget negotiations last week, South Carolina representatives debated and ultimately shot down amendments that would have in part cut DEI funding at specific colleges.\n\nStill, DEI at the state’s universities remains under scrutiny. As have their counterparts in other red states, South Carolina Republicans recently requested information from the state’s nearly three dozen public higher-education institutions regarding spending on programs and activities related to race or sexual orientation. According to one state representative, that spending totals nearly $8 million.\n\nA plan to remove and reform:Gov. Ron DeSantis proposes changes to diversity-based education programs\n\nTexas: Anti-DEI provision added to budget bill\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a directive last month warning state universities that the use of DEI in hiring is illegal. In response, institutions including Texas A&M University and the University of Houston have since announced they will no longer use diversity statements when hiring. The University of Texas Board of Regents, meanwhile, has “paused any new DEI policies on our campuses” and is reviewing existing ones.\n\n“The topic of DEI activities on college campuses has received tremendous attention nationally and here in Texas. To be clear, we welcome, celebrate, and strive for diversity on our campus with our student and faculty population,\" Board of Regents chairman Kevin Eltife said in a statement. \"I also think it’s fair to say in recent times, certain DEI efforts have strayed from the original intent to now imposing requirements and actions that, rightfully so, raised the concerns of our policymakers.\"\n\nNow, Texas lawmakers seek to take restrictions a step further with a provision that was recently added to the budget bill making its way through the House. The provision, approved by the appropriations committee, would ban colleges and universities from using state funds on DEI initiatives or similar programs.\n\nMore:Texas House panel sticks funding ban for college DEI programs in draft budget.

However, if the House proposal becomes law, colleges won’t be able to use any state money for “the design, implementation, or administration” of DEI practices and programs.\n\n“This prohibition includes, without limitation, the hiring and supervision of employees, mandatory or recommended training, or programmed activities,” the proposal states.\n\nThe bill bans DEI policies if they don't comply with Sections 3 and 3a in Article I of the Texas Constitution. Section 3 states that everyone has equal rights and no one is entitled to special privileges, while Section 3a mandates that \"equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed, or national origin.\"\n\nMore:Texas GOP lawmakers are targeting DEI in colleges. Here's why some students are concerned.\n\nIn March, the Texas House Committee on Appropriations added the DEI funding ban, as proposed by Rep. Carrie Isaac, R-Dripping Springs, in a draft version of the chamber's budget. State senators have approved adding similar language in Senate Bill 1, their proposed budget, but the full Senate has not yet voted on that bill.\n\nAfter the Senate approves its budget bill, if it is different from the House bill, the drafts will be forwarded to a conference committee with members from both chambers to produce a single bill for the House and Senate to vote on and send to Gov. Greg Abbott for final approval. The state Constitution requires lawmakers to pass a balanced budget.\n\nSeveral Texas Democrats have called to strike the DEI funding ban from the budget, with Rep. Victoria Neave Criado, D-Dallas, filing an amendment with such language, but her proposal failed in a 83-64 vote. Neave Criado said the ban violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that DEI programs help prevent discrimination in the hiring process.\n\nMore:Panel OKs ban on forcing college students to adopt beliefs on race, sex. Is it an issue?\n\n“We can vote to defund public colleges that honor the diversity of our communities. ... But we are better than that. This chamber is better than that,” Neave Criado said. “Texas is strongest when our institutions of higher education reflect the makeup of our public schools. Texas businesses enjoy peak innovation when creativity and diversity flourish.”\n\nRep. Ron Reynolds, chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, said thousands of students choose to attend colleges and universities in the state because of diversity. He said Texas has more Black people than any other state in the U.S., and that Texas should embrace its diversity instead of seeking to remove \"all the wonderful aspects\" of DEI.\n\n\"What kind of message are we sending to the record number of African Americans\" in Texas? asked Reynolds, D-Missouri City. \"What kind of message are we sending to Hispanics and Asians or people with disabilities? The message is loud and clear: You're not welcome in Texas. We want your money, but we don't want you in our university.\n\n\"That is the wrong message.\"\n\nThe ban comes as several Republican state lawmakers have proposed separate bills to end various diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at colleges, including DEI offices. They have argued that DEI efforts — a broad term for campus initiatives to promote diversity — have gone too far in higher education and are a source of division on college campuses.\n\nOn Friday, the Texas Senate Higher Education Subcommittee advanced a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices or requiring DEI statements. It also would prohibit public higher education institutions from requiring DEI training or hiring employees or contractors to perform the duties of a DEI office.\n\nSome students, faculty members and other supporters of DEI say lawmakers are mischaracterizing the true nature of DEI efforts on college campuses. They say DEI practices are created broadly to support underrepresented communities, including students of color, LGBTQ+ students, veterans, disabled students and low-income students.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/06/15/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-ban-on-dei-offices-in-public-universities/70327387007/", "title": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signs ban on DEI offices in public universities", "text": "Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill Wednesday that would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion offices in Texas public colleges and universities starting in 2024.\n\nBoth chambers of the Texas Legislature approved the final version in May of Senate Bill 17, which would ban public higher education institutions from maintaining or establishing DEI offices. It also prohibits higher education institutions from requiring anyone to provide DEI statements or participate in DEI training.\n\nThe legislation defines a DEI office as one that provides different treatment to people based on race, sex, color, or ethnicity through any policies, procedures, training, programs or activities. Under the law, students or employees could sue universities for \"injunctive or declaratory relief\" if they are required to participate in any DEI training.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have spent this year's legislative session in Texas railing against DEI offices and initiatives in higher education, which they say are divisive and cause a \"chilling effect\" on faculty and student speech.\n\nTexas students and faculty members, however, have pushed back, saying DEI offices and initiatives should remain and help people of color feel more included and thrive on campus.\n\nState Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, asserted banning them is a victory for free speech, Texas universities and the state's \"commitment to fostering true diversity and merit in higher education.\" He said eliminating DEI offices will result in millions in taxpayer savings and restore \"free inquiry, meritocracy, equal opportunity (and) genuine innovation.\"\n\n\"The days of political oaths, compelled speech, and racial profiling in university hiring are behind us,\" Creighton said in a statement. \"Moving forward, Texas will prioritize the advancement of the most qualified individuals and endorse policies that promote diversity and equality for our great state.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who oversees the Senate, made the bill one of his priorities this session. The legislation does not apply to academic course instruction, research, activities by student organizations, student recruitment or admissions.\n\nIn a statement, Texas Students for DEI, a coalition of college students, condemned the \"misguided decision to remove DEI offices and programs\" on college campuses. They said DEI provides an \"open and supportive environment\" on college campuses and its removal would threaten the ability of universities to support underserved students.\n\n\"DEI is not going away,\" the coalition wrote in a statement. \"Attempts to make daily life more diverse, equitable, and inclusive are not going away. The implementation of DEI offices and practices may be banned from college campuses, but the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion can never be removed from us, the people.\"\n\nTexas is the second state in the U.S. to ban certain DEI initiatives in higher education. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last month banning funding for DEI programs, prompting the NAACP to issue a travel advisory for the state.\n\nBefore the Texas House passed the measure, Rep. Ron Reynolds, chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, urged other members not to be on the \"wrong side of history\" and lead the state down the same road as Florida.\n\n\"Don't let the politics of extremism get in the way (of) the progress that we've made over the years, because many people of good conscience, not just African Americans, but Hispanics, Asians, (have worked) together collaboratively to make Texas a better place, to address the Jim Crow legislation of the past,\" said Reynolds, D-Missouri City. \"Diversity, equity and inclusion programs have helped propel this state forward.\"\n\nAs part of the new law, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is required to study how the legislation affects recruitment and retention of college students. The state auditor will have to conduct audits of public colleges and universities at least every four years to determine whether the schools have spent state money in violation of the ban.\n\nTexas lawmakers already approved a state budget with language prohibiting the use of state money for \"unconstitutional\" diversity, equity and inclusion programs and practices at public higher education institutions, sending it to Abbott for signature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/03/11/texas-legislature-senate-bill-17-ban-dei-offices-statements-violators/69997111007/", "title": "Texas Senate bill would ban DEI offices, statements at public ...", "text": "A bill filed Friday in the Texas Senate would prohibit public higher education institutions across the state from maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices or requiring DEI statements in admissions or hiring.\n\nIf Senate Bill 17 passed, a state board would create a list of employees who violate certain portions of the bill. That list would be shared with every public university and college in Texas. Colleges wouldn't be able to hire first-time violators until the end of the academic year when the violation occurred. Repeat violators would be fired and could not be considered for rehiring for five years after the dismissal.\n\nThe bill is one of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s top legislative priorities. State Sen. Brandon Creighton, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Higher Education, filed the bill. Eight additional senators have signed on to the bill as authors as of Saturday morning.\n\nThe current draft of the bill prohibits public colleges and universities in Texas from having a DEI office or hiring employees or outside contractors to “perform the duties” of a DEI office. The expansive bill blocks any public office that promotes efforts “designed or implemented in reference to race, color, or ethnicity.” It also bans training or activities “designed or implemented in reference to race, color, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation” — except those required under state or federal law.\n\nMore:University of Texas System to halt new diversity, equity and inclusion policies on campuses\n\nCreighton, R-Conroe, said “so-called” DEI offices are the leading threat to diversity and inclusivity on university campuses. He said people should be welcomed and promoted at universities based on their qualifications.\n\n“The elevation of DEI offices on campuses have only furthered divides and created a chilling effect on open dialogue,” Creighton wrote in a statement. “This legislation will ensure Texas college campuses are environments that are open to differing ideas, foster meaningful, reasoned dialogue, and encourage intellectual discourse.”\n\nThe bill would prohibit universities from asking current students, employees, contractors, job applicants and students applying for admission for DEI statements or to “endorse an ideology that promotes the differential treatment of an individual or group of individuals based on race, color, or ethnicity.”\n\nCreighton’s bill would keep universities from asking people to provide statements on their “views on or experience” with race, ethnicity or national origin and their contributions to efforts involving DEI, marginalized groups, anti-racism, social justice or intersectionality.\n\nMore:How diverse are students, employees at Austin-area colleges and universities?\n\nIt would ban universities from requiring students, employees or job applicants to participate in training on DEI, bias, oppression or gender identity unless the training is required by state or federal law.\n\nUniversities would face a fine of either $1 million or 1% of the school’s operating expenses — whichever is less — for violations if the bill becomes law. Employees would be placed on unpaid leave for their first violation and fired for their second violation. Faculty members could have their tenure revoked.\n\nThe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — overseer of public universities in the state — would maintain a list of employees who violate the section regarding the prohibition on DEI offices and DEI statements. That list would be shared with other public universities, and universities would be limited from hiring people on the list.\n\nThe proposed bill allows members of a Board of Regents, appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, to approve or deny hires for several positions, including provost, associate or assistant provost, dean or associate or assistant dean, at each institution they oversee.\n\nThe regents would have the authority to approve or deny courses in the core curriculum and postings for tenured faculty positions at the institution they oversee.\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, also filed Senate Bill 16, another priority of Patrick's, to prohibit faculty from compelling or attempting to compel students to “adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior to any other race, sex, ethnicity, or belief.”\n\nLawmakers have until May 29, when the legislative session ends, to pass any bills and send them to the governor to become law.\n\nMore:University of Texas 'operational plan' to execute, track 2022 DEI goals remains unreleased", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/05/28/texas-legislature-passes-budget-defunding-dei-offices-in-universities/70263798007/", "title": "DEI in universities: Texas Legislature OKs budget defunding program", "text": "The Texas Legislature has approved the state's budget for the next biennium with a provision prohibiting the use of state money for \"unconstitutional\" diversity, equity and inclusion programs and practices at public higher education institutions.\n\nHouse Bill 1 states that colleges and universities can't use state funds for the \"design, implementation, or administration\" of DEI programs and practices that don't comply with Sections 3 and 3a in Article I of the Texas Constitution.

Then it will go to Gov. Greg Abbott for approval, although Abbott can cut any line items as he sees fit.\n\nDuring budget debate Friday, Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, questioned whether the bill would affect funding for the state's Historically Underutilized Business Program if universities currently house those programs within DEI offices. The program promotes opportunities for small businesses owned by people of color and women.\n\nSen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, who authored a similar college DEI funding ban in the Senate's initial draft budget, said the legislation would affect the program's funding if it was in a DEI unit.\n\nHowever, he said universities could still fund certain programs if they, like the HUB Program, existed before the establishment of a school's DEI office, didn't \"carry out DEI activities\" and are separated from any DEI units within a school once the bill becomes law. The bill also doesn't prohibit colleges from using private money on DEI efforts.\n\nThe legislation is part of Republican lawmakers' efforts to end certain DEI programs and initiatives in higher education this session.

Every Democrat voted no, and two Republicans were absent. That's a big difference from what happened in the Ohio House in April. Nearly all that chamber's Democrats voted for that version of the state spending plan.\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, told reporters he decided to go in a more conservative, policy-driven direction centered around tax cuts and education reforms.\n\n\"This is a solid conservative budget,\" Huffman said Thursday. \"The House has 67 Republicans there. It's likely that all other things being equal if it was a normal course that there would probably be 50 votes for it.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that's not likely to happen, though, and expects to spend the next two weeks hashing out a final version to give Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSenate Democrats slammed the budget plan.\n\n\"We chose not to offer any amendments because, to us, this bill is so fundamentally and foundationally flawed that no floor amendment was going to redeem it,\" Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.\n\nHere are some of the key highlights of the Senate budget plan.\n\nPublic education overhaul\n\nOhio's K-12 public schools would get a $1.3 billion increase under the Senate's plan, but that was about $541 million less than the House proposed.\n\nInstead, the Senate expanded eligibility for Ohio's EdChoice scholarships to every student on a sliding scale basis, where children whose parents earn more receive smaller amounts.\n\n\"We wanted to provide parents throughout the entire state the opportunity to decide for themselves where their child should be educated,\" Finance Chair Sen. Matt Dolan, R-Chagrin Falls, said. \"Like the governor, like the House, we've expanded school choice. Unlike them, we have said that choice belongs to everyone.\"\n\nRepublicans also added Senate Bill 1, which would put the governor's office in charge of K-12 education by making the Department of Education's director a cabinet appointee. The State Board of Education elects the department's current leader.\n\nAlso added to the budget plan was Senate Bill 83, which would prohibit most mandatory diversity, equity and inclusion training, give greater oversight to partnerships with Chinese universities, restrict the kinds of public positions public colleges and universities could take, penalize teachers who fail to create classrooms \"free from bias,\" and ban professors from striking.\n\n\"This is bad for education and bad for Ohio,\" Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said. \"The anti-strike provisions make it the worst attack on collective bargaining this chamber has seen since Senate Bill 5 in 2011.\"\n\nTobacco, TikTok and working from home\n\nIn addition to deciding how to spend Ohio's general revenue fund, the Senate plan would ban the sale or distribution of flavored vaping products except menthol.\n\nThat's a restriction DeWine has wanted for years, but the last effort came with a prohibition on local governments such as Columbus regulating tobacco more strictly than the state − something the governor vetoed in 2022.\n\nThis budget would also ban the use of TikTok and other Chinese apps on state government devices and require state employees to work from their offices four days per week.\n\n\"I believe and the Senate believes that you do more work, you do more effective work when you're physically present at your workplace,\" Huffman said.\n\nTax cuts\n\nThe latest version of the Senate's budget bumped an overall tax cut up to $3.1 billion and included a business tax cut that will eliminate the Commercial Activities Tax for 90% of the companies who pay it.\n\n\"As I said early on, the Senate's focus is returning money to taxpayers, and that means small businesses, that means all levels of income,\" Dolan said.\n\nAll Ohioans who pay income taxes would get an income tax reduction, and there would be a new sales tax holiday in August 2024 for most tangible items that cost less than $500.\n\nNew rules for teenagers on social media\n\nTeens younger than 16 would have to get parental approval before creating new social media accounts, as the budget included provisions for companies like Facebook and Snapchat to verify the age of new users.\n\nThat's another item DeWine has been pushing for in this budget.\n\nBut when those children turn 18, the Senate's budget would allow them to become police officers. The provision was added Wednesday afternoon and would allow (but not require) departments to lower their minimum age for serving from 21 to 18.\n\nOpponents, which include some statewide police organizations, aren't convinced that this is a good solution to their staffing problems.\n\n\"We do not feel teenagers have the maturity and experience to handle the oftentimes complex and life-altering calls officers face daily,\" said Mike Weinman, the director of governmental affairs for Ohio's Fraternal Order of Police in March.\n\nBig changes for public benefits\n\nThe House wanted to spend about $4.2 million covering the school breakfasts and lunches for students who qualify for a reduced rate, but the Senate nixed that idea.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate also decided not to go with the governor and House on the increase in income eligibility for publicly funded childcare, saying capacity is already an issue at many of these daycares.\n\n\"We did provide (federal COVID relief) dollars for building out daycares and hope to expand that as we go forward,\" Dolan said. \"But having enough spots is the problem right now that we have to address.\"\n\nProposed work training for people who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance was scrapped on Wednesday, but the Senate added a new rule that Ohio's benefit debit cards have a photo of the recipient (or one recipient from the household).\n\nThe Senate did restore money the governor requested for an affordable housing credit.\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/05/22/texas-house-approves-bill-banning-dei-offices-at-public-universities/70213772007/", "title": "Texas House approves bill banning DEI offices at public colleges ...", "text": "The Texas House on Monday gave final approval to a bill that would prohibit Texas public colleges and universities from maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices despite hours of impassioned efforts from Democrats to amend or halt the legislation.\n\nIn an 83-62 vote, the lower chamber approved its version of Senate Bill 17, filed by Rep. John Kuempel, R-Seguin. His bill also would ban higher education institutions from requiring DEI statements and DEI training.\n\nIt defines DEI offices as an office that provides different treatment to people based on race, sex, color or ethnicity through any policies, procedures, trainings, programs or activities.\n\nOn Friday, before the bill's initial consideration in the House, Democratic members made several unsuccessful points of order on both SB 17 and Republican amendments to the bill as part of an effort to weaken or kill the legislation. They also proposed about 20 amendments that did not pass but effectively forced Republican lawmakers to delay the official vote on the bill until nearly 11 p.m.\n\nTexas Legislature:House delays considering changes to tenure after Democrats raise challenge\n\nIn an apparent compromise, the bill's author eventually ended the onslaught of amendments from Democrats by proposing an amendment of his own that the House adopted before approving the legislation. The new amendment would require the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to conduct a yearly study on how the bill affects recruitment and retention for college students. The board oversees public universities and colleges in the state.\n\nIf the bill is enacted, the amended language states that higher education institutions must make efforts to reassign employees into jobs with similar pay if their position would be eliminated by the bill. It also moved the bill's effective date from Sept. 1, 2023, to Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nSB 17 now heads back to the Senate, where members will need to sign off on the changes the House made. If the Senate does not approve, the bill would be referred to a conference committee that would propose a new version of the bill to both chambers for final consideration on whether to send the legislation to Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who oversees the Senate, has said the bill is one of his priorities this legislative session, which ends Monday.\n\nDivide over DEI offices, programs\n\nRepublican state lawmakers have said the legislation is necessary because they believe DEI programs are causing division in college campuses and have a \"chilling effect\" on faculty and student speech.\n\nWhile laying out the bill Friday, Kuempel claimed that there was \"virtually no evidence\" from any Texas higher education institution that DEI programs had closed the gap with minority student outcomes, minority recruitment or faculty hiring.\n\nSenate Bill 15:Texas House OKs bill to limit on transgender college athletes participation in sports\n\n\"What this bill does is make sure that we can actually accomplish our goal of promoting diversity rather than using diversity to create a narrow, closed-minded environment,\" said Kuempel, chair of the House Committee on Higher Education.\n\nHowever, opponents of the legislation, including several Democratic lawmakers, University of Texas students and faculty members, have strongly disputed Kuempel's claim. They say DEI offices and other initiatives need to remain on campuses because they help people of color feel more included and thrive on campus.\n\n\"Diversity is not a threat. Equitable access to education is not a threat. Inclusion is not a threat,\" Rep. Victoria Neave Criado, D-Dallas, said while debating the bill Friday. \"We turn our cheek away from the real threats that our communities face — the threats of gun violence, threats of poverty, housing insecurity, the threat of illiteracy.\"\n\nThe House initially was set to consider a scaled-back version of SB 17, compared with the legislation that the Texas Senate passed last month, although both versions of the bill still proposed bans on universities having DEI offices, requiring DEI statements and implementing mandatory DEI training.\n\nMore:State lawmakers, Huston-Tillotson students launch Texas HBCU Legislative Caucus\n\nHowever, during Friday's debate, the House approved an amendment from Kuempel, by an 81-57 vote, that added much of the language from the Senate version into the House substitute of the bill.\n\nWhat's in the new version of Senate Bill 17?\n\nKuempel's bill as amended allows college students or employees to sue their university for \"injunctive or declaratory relief\" if they are required to participate in any DEI training.\n\nIt also would require the state auditor to conduct audits of public colleges and universities at least every four years to determine if the schools have spent state money in violation of the law.\n\nIf institutions violate the law, they would need to resolve the violation within 180 days or they would be ineligible to receive formula funding increases or funding for \"exceptional items\" in the following biennium.\n\nRally at Texas Capitol:Why Texas students, faculty say DEI, tenure is needed in colleges\n\nThe House also approved adding a provision that would allow colleges to submit statements to highlight their work serving first-generation, low-income and underserved students when applying to grants or complying with accreditation requirements, replacing a similar section in the original bill.\n\nThe bill still includes a section stating it does not apply to academic course instruction, research, activities by student organizations, student recruitment or admissions.\n\nUnlike the Senate bill, the House's version of SB 17 also adds language about the purpose of higher education to the state's education code. The language is pulled verbatim from Senate Bill 16, dubbed the \"critical race theory\" bill.\n\nThe text states that all \"public higher education institutions must be committed to creating an environment of intellectual inquiry, academic freedom and intellectual diversity so students are respected and prepared for the workforce.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/03/17/texas-legislature-house-committee-funding-ban-college-dei-programs/70017244007/", "title": "Texas Legislature: House panel OKs funding ban on college DEI ...", "text": "Update: The Texas House Committee on Appropriations approved House Bill 1 on Thursday, which included a rider that would ban colleges and universities from using state funds on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

Greg Abbott for approval, including proposals to provide hundreds of millions of extra dollars to the state's 50 community colleges and to create a $3 billion endowment for higher education research, pending voter approval of a constitutional amendment.\n\nHere's a look at some of the priority bills that lawmakers passed this year:\n\nMore:Texas Legislature approves state budget that defunds DEI programs in public universities\n\nDubbed the \"Save Women’s Sports Act,\" SB 15 requires student-athletes to compete on college sports teams that align with their sex assigned at birth. If it becomes law, transgender women would have to play on men’s collegiate sports teams and transgender men would have to play on women’s teams.\n\nSen. Mayes Middleton, R-Galveston, sponsored the bill in the Senate, and Rep. John Kuempel, R-Seguin, sponsored it in the House. The effective date is Sept. 1.\n\nSB 17 would prohibit Texas public colleges and universities from maintaining or establishing diversity, equity and inclusion offices starting in 2024. It also prohibits higher education institutions from requiring anyone to provide DEI statements or participate in DEI training.\n\nSen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, sponsored the bill in the Senate, and Kuempel sponsored it in the House. The effective date is Jan. 1.\n\nMore:Texas students wait up to 19 hours to testify against bill to ban college DEI offices\n\nThe legislation enshrines a definition of tenure into the state's Education Code and would make changes to tenure policies at the state's public higher education institutions. It requires governing boards overseeing public colleges and universities in the state to adopt policies allowing institutions to fire tenured faculty for several reasons, including \"professional incompetence\" or \"conduct involving moral turpitude.\"\n\nCreighton authored the Senate version of the legislation and Kuempel authored the House version. The effective date is Sept. 1\n\nAs the state faces a nursing shortage, SB 25 allows the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to create programs to support student loan repayment and scholarships for registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses and nurses seeking to become nursing faculty.\n\nSen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham sponsored the legislation in the Senate, and Kuempel sponsored it in the House. It would go into effect immediately if it becomes law.\n\nMore:Rally at Texas Capitol: Why Texas students, faculty say DEI, tenure is needed in colleges\n\nHB 8 would award about $430 million to community colleges based on the number of students who earn \"credentials of value,\" complete at least 15 hours of courses and transfer to a four-year university, enroll in dual credit courses, or take courses that \"apply toward academic or workforce program requirements.\"\n\nThe bill would also create the Financial Aid for Swift Transfer program to enroll high school students who are economically disadvantaged in dual credit courses at no cost.\n\nRep. Gary VanDeaver, R-New Boston, sponsored the bill in the House, and Creighton sponsored it in the Senate. It would go into effect immediately if it becomes law.\n\nHB 1595 changes the name of the National Research University Fund, which currently provides funding to \"emerging research universities,\" to the Texas University Fund and makes other changes to the fund. HJR 3 proposes a constitutional amendment to voters on Nov. 7 seeking approval to create the fund and add $3 billion to it.\n\nRep. Greg Bonnen, R-Friendswood, authored the legislation in the House, and Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, authored the Senate version of the legislation. HB 1595 takes effect on Jan. 1, pending voter approval of the constitutional amendment.\n\nThe Legislature also passed additional higher education bills, including:\n\nSB 37: filed by Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, makes clarifications to the state's anti-hazing law, including providing immunity to corporations and other entities supporting university student organizations if they report hazing and cooperate with investigators.\n\nSB 1055: filed by Sen. Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, incorporates Stephen F. Austin State University into the University of Texas System. Abbott has already signed the bill into law.\n\nSB 1517: filed by Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, prohibits Texas public colleges and universities from implementing academic boycotts of Israel and other nations if the boycotts prohibit people from studying or conducting research.\n\nSB 2538: filed by Creighton, allows the University of Texas to continue its current admissions practices, where 75% of the school's freshman class must be automatically admitted every year.

Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, told the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau. \"They have gone way too far to the left and, in the name of diversity, have buried real diversity.\"\n\nMore:New diversity training, bias rules inside latest version of Ohio's higher education bill\n\nCirino chairs the Senate Higher Education and Workforce Committee, which recommended Senate Bill 83 for a vote by the full Senate.\n\nCritics say while robust debate on Ohio's college campuses is a laudable goal, Cirino's plan tramples on academic freedom and could cause professors to skirt controversial subjects out of fear of reprisal from their administrations.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"I believe this is the worst assault on academic freedom that I have ever seen,\" Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said on the Senate floor before Wednesday's vote.\n\nSB 83 now heads to the Ohio House, where hearings are underway on a companion piece of legislation.\n\nBut as support grows among Republican politicians, opposition to the legislation continues to grow in Ohio's institutions of higher education.\n\nOhio State's Board of Trustees issued a rare public statement Tuesday, saying SB 83 raised \"important questions about 21st-century education,\" but the legislation as its currently written could \"undermine the shared governance model of universities, risk weakened academic rigor, or impose extensive and expensive new reporting mandates.\"\n\nBias on campus\n\nAt the heart of Cirino's legislation is a belief that conservative students and staff feel pressured to conform to, or at least appear to believe in, more liberal ideologies. That's why he proposed that creating classrooms \"free from bias\" be a component of professor evaluations and banned litmus testing for new hires.\n\n\"This whole bill is about the students,\" Cirino said. \"My bill is about creating more speech, not less of it, and what I call true academic freedom.\"\n\nHowever, professors from Ohio's public colleges and universities challenged Cirino's premise during hours of committee debate on SB 83.\n\n\"I encourage my students to think for themselves,\" Ohio State University professor Pranav Jani said. \"I wouldn’t have it any other way, and that’s the norm at Ohio’s universities.\"\n\nMore:Ohio State's Board of Trustees issue a statement opposing Senate Bill 83\n\nBut the truth, according to Jeremy Young from the free speech nonprofit PEN America, might be more complicated.\n\n\"He's (Cirino's) trying to solve for the wrong problem,\" Young said.\n\nHe pointed to two recent surveys of college campuses in other states: One from the University of Virginia in 2022 and the other at the University of Wisconsin in 2023. Conservative students at both universities reported feeling more pressure to agree with a specific political or ideological view.\n\n\"What this suggests is that there is a problem − a huge problem with a lack of viewpoint diversity in higher ed − but it is not being caused by teachers,\" Young said.\n\nWhen you dive into the student responses on why they don't feel comfortable sharing in class, some cite their professors' beliefs, but most talk about a fear of social backlash or isolation from their peers.\n\n\"This is a student-to-student problem,\" Young said. \"And what that means is it’s a problem that can be solved with education.\"\n\nTake the Wisconsin survey, for example; 40% of very liberal students wanted university administrators to \"ban expression of views they feel cause harm,\" while just 7% of very conservative students thought that was a good idea.\n\nYoung, who used to be a college professor, thinks teaching about the First Amendment, free speech and how to respectfully disagree could alleviate most of the issues Cirino sees.\n\n\"This is not a picture of indoctrination,\" he said. \"The picture they paint is students muddling through these conversations without adequate support.\"\n\nA growing national divide\n\nThe vote on SB 83 comes amid a national wave of conservative legislation seeking to change how students and staff experience life on America's college campuses.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a law earlier this week that defunded diversity, equity and inclusion programs, referred to as DEI, and limited how race is discussed in class.\n\nTexas is close to a final vote on three pieces of legislation that would close DEI offices, eliminate tenure for new hires and fire professors who \"attempt\" to compel students to believe that one “social, political or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\nIn total, 34 anti-DEI bills have been introduced in 20 states, according to a bill-tracking project by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nAnd they appear to be derivatives of model legislation to abolish \"DEI bureaucracies\" written by the conservative Manhattan Institute and the National Association of Scholars in January.\n\n\"Ohio’s universities are no longer capable of reforming themselves to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom,\" National Association of Scholars President Peter Wood said when he came to testify in support of SB 83. \"Ohio can only restore its universities to the pursuit of truth, instead of the pursuit of indoctrination, if state policymakers pass a comprehensive reform bill.\"\n\nPEN America is tracking what Young called \"educational gag order bills\" more broadly and put the total number closer to 100. And he thinks Ohio's might be the most expansive in the country.\n\n\"It takes all of the bad ideas that have been proposed in higher ed legislation and throws them all into one Frankenstein's monster of a bill,\" he said.\n\nOhio's version includes increased oversight on partnerships with Chinese universities, mandatory history classes, changes to how boards of trustees work, post-tenure review requirements and a ban on higher institutions taking public positions on controversial issues (though that would not apply to legislative lobbying efforts).\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.\n\nGet more political analysis by listening to the Ohio Politics Explained podcast", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/17"}]}

The next year, the first National Woman’s Day was announced by the Socialist Party of America.\n\nClara Zetkin, a German communist and women’s rights activist born in 1857, came up with the idea of an international day for women at the International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen in 1910 – “and the 100 women there, from 17 countries, agreed to it unanimously”, said the BBC.\n\nAs a result IWD was first celebrated in 1911 in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, making this year, technically, the 111th International Women’s Day. But the day was only officially recognised by the United Nations in 1975.\n\nIt is a national holiday in several countries including Russia, “where flower sales double” in the days before the event, as well as in China, where women are given half a day off work.\n\nThis year’s IWD theme\n\nThe UN has said that the theme for 2022 is “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”, which is aimed at “recognizing the contribution of women and girls around the world, who are leading the charge on climate change adaptation, mitigation, and response, to build a more sustainable future for all”, according to UN Women.\n\n“Women are increasingly being recognized as more vulnerable to climate change impacts than men, as they constitute the majority of the world’s poor and are more dependent on the natural resources which climate change threatens the most,” said the website.\n\n“At the same time, women and girls are effective and powerful leaders and change-makers for climate adaptation and mitigation. They are involved in sustainability initiatives around the world, and their participation and leadership results in more effective climate action.”\n\nA second theme chosen by the International Women’s Day website is #BreakTheBias, which asks people to imagine “a world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination”.\n\nUK-based events\n\nA virtual panel with UN leaders, climate activists and celebrities will be hosted by the UN on 8 March.\n\nAcross the UK, a host of events will be taking place.

Des Moines will be overrun with close to 1,500 participants from more than 50 countries here to take part in our Borlaug Dialogue symposium and Global Youth Institute for high school students and teachers.\n\nIn addition, 700 Iowans will take part in our Iowa Hunger Summit on Oct. 10. Several thousand others will attend more than 20 \"Laureate Lectures\" around the state and watch our Laureate Award Ceremony (often called the \"Oscars of Agriculture\") live on IPTV as we present our $250,000 award to the four pioneers of bio-fortification — infusing crops with essential vitamins and minerals and decreasing malnutrition in Africa.\n\nIt all will be an incredible week-long celebration of the legacy of our founder, Norman Borlaug. But it represents a dramatic change from when I first returned from Cambodia in 1999 to accept the invitation of the new chairman, John Ruan III, to become president of the World Food Prize.\n\nJohn told me that my mission was simple: just fulfill Norm Borlaug’s dream and make the World Food Prize into the “Nobel Prize for food and agriculture,” and his father's vision that Des Moines could be seen as the food and agricultural capital of America.\n\nWith just a one-person staff operating from a small two-room office, and only about 50 people from outside Iowa attending the one-day World Food Prize event each October, it seemed like Mission Impossible. But with the support of the state, the generosity of our many donors, and the dedication and hard work of our foundation staff, the World Food Prize has grown remarkably over the past two decades.\n\nThe World Food Prize is now a week-long set of events in October and year-around programs that provide significant benefit to the students, businesses and citizens of our state. Included are our:\n\nLaureate Award Ceremony at the magnificent Iowa State Capitol that gives the World Food Prize the aura of a regal Nobel event. When I arrived in 2000, there were no female laureates, nor any Africans. Now in 2016, with six women and five African laureates, the World Food Prize is truly seen as the foremost international award in agriculture and food security.\n\nBorlaug Dialogue International Symposium, which brings the world to Iowa, with speakers such as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, Kofi Annan and Bill Gates, who launched his multi-billion dollar initiative to lift up Africa from our symposium stage.\n\nGates chose our venue for this historic announcement because his staff had told him that they had “met a more diverse array of people at the World Food Prize in Des Moines than at any other conference they had attended anywhere in the world.”\n\nSir Gordon Conway has referred to our symposium as “the premier conference in the world on global agriculture.” One journalist noted that the World Food Prize \"brings more CEOs to Iowa than any other organization,\" thus playing a significant role in promoting Iowa’s economic development.\n\nIowa Youth Institute, Global Youth Institute, and Borlaug-Ruan International Internships, for high school students and Wallace-Carver Fellowships and George Washington Carver college internships, all of which promote STEM education for Iowa students. The results are amazing.\n\nConsider that 92 percent of all students in our youth programs major in agriculture or STEM-related subjects in college; 77 percent ultimately have careers in these areas; two-thirds of all participants are young women; and 63 percent of all Iowa high schools have participated in our Iowa Youth Institute.\n\nWorld Food Prize Hall of Laureates, open to the public, is celebrating its fifth anniversary. More than 15,000 visitors a year see the spectacular art telling the story of our state’s amazing agricultural heritage, and learn about our LEED Platinum certification, the highest possible level of resource conservation and energy efficiency.\n\nIowa Hunger Summit, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, began in 2006 with a column in the Register by outgoing Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack and former Republican Govs. Robert Ray and Terry Branstad as co- founders of the event. It remains the place where Iowans come together across party lines to confront hunger.\n\nOthers will have to judge whether we have fulfilled the dreams of Norman Borlaug and John Ruan Sr. One of my most vivid memories of Borlaug is of sitting with him in September of 2009, just a few days before he died. Weak from the ravages of cancer, his voice was only a whisper, so I had to lean in to hear him. Squeezing my hand he said, \" Ken, I am so grateful...\" but then his voice trailed off and he slipped away.\n\nEditorial spurred change\n\nIt is remarkable that the World Food Prize is located in Iowa and still in existence only because of an editorial that ran in the Des Moines Register on Dec. 24, 1989. That piece urged Iowa to rescue the World Food Prize, because its original sponsor in New York had withdrawn its financial support and the award was about to go out of existence.\n\nIf you are wondering who reads editorials on Christmas Eve, the answer is John Ruan Sr., who stepped in and, with bipartisan support from Gov. Terry Branstad and the state Legislature, endowed the World Food Prize and gave it a new home in central Iowa.\n\nThrough all of these above programs, the World Food Prize has been attempting to re-pay Iowa for rescuing it when it appeared it was about to go out of existence.\n\n\n\n\n\nKENNETH QUINN is the president of the World Food Prize.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/10/chinese-new-year-2024-lunar-new-year/72521207007/", "title": "2024 Lunar New Year: See photos of Asian communities celebrating ...", "text": "Lunar New Year, one of the most important celebrations in Asian culture, marks the beginning of the new calendar year with family gatherings and a day of rest. It's also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. It is celebrated by millions all across the world.\n\nLunar New Year starts today Feb. 10 and ends with the Lantern Festival on Feb. 24. In China, the public holiday lasts from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17 this year.\n\nThe Chinese zodiac, or Sheng Xiao (生肖), is a repeating 12-year cycle of animal signs and their attributes, based on the lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. This year is known as the Year of the Dragon.\n\nStarting with the first new moon of the lunar calendar, Lunar New Year begins, and ends 15 days later on the first full moon. Each year, the holiday is celebrated on a different date because the calendar is based on the moon cycles.\n\nAs a tradition, many families put red paper decorations on the windows and the doors with couplets which also called chunlian. Written in black or gold on red paper, the couplets are placed outside of an Asian home with messages of gratitude and wishes for the new year, The National Museum of Asian Art explains.\n\nThe Lunar New Year’s Eve starts the holiday with a spread of symbolic dishes.

But for others it can be almost exotic.\n\nJill Hawkins, executive director of the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown, loves to talk about a couple from Australia who vacation at the festival every other year, sampling hard-to-find bourbons that we can pluck off a shelf whenever we feel like it at our local Kroger.\n\nSo instead of taking Kentucky's greatest gift to cocktails for granted, let's approach National Bourbon Heritage Month like one of those deprived Australians and dive in.\n\nHere are some events you shouldn't miss this September:\n\nKentucky Bourbon Festival\n\nNow in its 27th year, the Kentucky Bourbon Festival is the largest bourbon festival in the world. Hawkins has been with the festival for six years and loves what it has done for the industry and Bardstown, which has thrived as its host.\n\nAround 50,000 people are expected to attend the multi-day event Sept. 12-16. They'll find tastings, seminars, a car show, golf tournament, art and three days of live music.\n\nMore:Who run the (bourbon) world? Women, no matter how we drink it\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about bourbon and a lot of attention being paid to bourbon right now, and new people have been learning to love bourbon,\" Hawkins said. \"We call that 'coming to the right side.' People are falling love with it all over the world.\"\n\nThe festival, which began as a simple dinner party attended by industry heavyweights, has solidified Bardstown's claim to be the world's bourbon capital. Nearly 70 percent of the world's bourbon is estimated to be made in or near Bardstown.\n\nThe state's recent focus on bourbonism and the development of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail and the Urban Bourbon Trail were all developed long after the festival's start, and Hawkins feels that the fest was ground zero.\n\n\"I think that the festival was a great example of everything that was possible with bourbon,\" Hawkins said. \"People were looking for new experiences and they found the festival and it really set a good tone for those consumers.\"\n\nThe festival still focuses on all aspects of the industry, Hawkins said, from farmers to barrel makers. Warehouse workers compete in the fan-favorite World Championship Bourbon Barrel Relay, a racing contest.\n\n\"We always say we celebrate the entire industry and we really mean it,\" Hawkins said.\n\nThe festival is free to attend but some specialty events, such as seminars, are ticketed. Go to www.kybourbonfestival.com for a full list of free and paid events.\n\nRelated:The best modern bourbon restaurant might be this hotspot in Bardstown\n\nBourbon & Beyond and Louder Than Life\n\nThese sister music festivals are staged by a California company that has fully embraced the bourbon trend and run on consecutive weekends.\n\nBourbon & Beyond is Sept. 22-23 and Louder Than Life Sept. 28-30. Bourbon and plenty of it, along with seminars and bourbon-paired dinners, is the common thread between the two. Other than that they are very different.\n\nBourbon & Beyond's vibe is more mainstream rock with a retro twist, starring Sting, Robert Plant, John Mayer, David Byrne and Sheryl Crow. Louder Than Life is for metal and hard rock fans and stars Nine Inch Nails, Alice in Chains and Godsmack.\n\nBoth festivals will feature massive bourbon bars sponsored by the Courier Journal.\n\nTickets range from $90-$500 for Bourbon & Beyond, available at Bourbonandbeyond.com, and $79.50-$999 for Louder Than Life, available at Louderthanlifefestival.com.\n\nRead this:Louisville's Bourbon & Beyond reveals its lineup, complete with rock legends\n\nSee also:Avenged Sevenfold forced to cancel as headliners at Louder Than Life\n\nUrban Bourbon Trail\n\nThe Urban Bourbon Trail is a team of local restaurants and bars that feature bourbon, sometimes a lot of bourbon, and they're located throughout Louisville.\n\nOn Saturday, a fresh new passport for the Urban Bourbon Trail will be released at the Louisville Visitor Center, 301 S 4th St., so stop by and grab one. They're free and you get an official Urban Bourbon Trail t-shirt once you fill it.\n\nOn Sept. 20, the Louisville Visitor Center will host an Urban Bourbon Trail Night from 6-8 p.m.. They'll introduce new members to the trail and give especially thirsty members a chance to fill their passport in one night, and because it's National Bourbon Heritage Month, you'll get a second free gift.\n\nAll bourbon merchandise will be on sale Sept. 20 for 25 percent off, which is pretty smart when you consider how easy it is to buy stuff while drinking.\n\nFor more information, visit Bourboncountry.com.\n\nInside look: Tour Louisville's newest hot spot, Rabbit Hole Distillery\n\nMore:The best modern bourbon restaurant might be this hotspot in Bardstown\n\nThe Great Distillery BBQ Cook-Off\n\nThis is the second year that Jim Beam and its master distiller, Fred Noe, have hosted the Great Distillery BBQ Cook-Off.\n\nThe barbecue competition is 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sept. 8 in Clermont, Kentucky, where Jim Beam is made, and will feature distillers from around the state using their bourbons in the name of barbecue, putting \"their meat where their mash is,\" according to Beam's hype.\n\nAttendance is free but the wide range of available cocktails, and the distillery tours, will require cash and credit.

It's an event \"celebrated around the world when people take time to appreciate humankind's connection to the Earth and to raise awareness of our environmental challenges,\" according to the Earth Day Initiative, a New York City-based non-profit group.\n\nJohn Oppermann, executive director of the Earth Day Initiative, said that “with each passing day, the urgency for climate action grows, and we are running out of time. This is a pivotal year for our global community to acknowledge and respect the science of climate and COVID.\"\n\nLike last year, most Earth Day events this year will be online because of the pandemic.\n\n\"Most of our Earth Day events will be virtual with the exception of individual and small group cleanups through our 'Great Global Cleanup' program,\" said Olivia Altman of EarthDay.org, formerly the Earth Day Network.\n\nDespite the pandemic, \"there's lots of excitement around this Earth Day,\" Rogers told USA TODAY. Overall, more than 1 billion people in 192 countries participate in each Earth Day \"to build environmental democracy and advocate for sustainability,\" according to EarthDay.org.\n\n\"Last year, we were able to reach millions through our digital Earth Day Live event,\" Altman said. \"This year, with our second-annual Earth Day Live virtual event, we believe we can grow even further.\"\n\nThe global show begins at noon EDT on Thursday and will run parallel to the Biden administration’s global climate summit, also set for Earth Day.\n\n\"Our four-hour event will be action-packed,\" she promised. \"Our panels, workshops, films and performances, will include world climate leaders, activists, educators, musicians, influencers and more.\"\n\nEarth Day turns 51 this year.

He lived his owner Leonel Costa and his family, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nCosta’s father decided that they could not care for the litter of four puppies Bobi was born into, because they already had too many animals. So, they decided to do away with the litter.\n\n“Unfortunately, at that time it was considered normal by older people ... to bury the animals in a hole so that they would not survive,” Costa shared with Guinness.\n\nCosta and his brothers were able to find Bobi alive nearby. He was lucky enough to escape, hiding in a pile of wood at their home.\n\nThe siblings kept the puppy’s existence a secret for as long as they could, but when the boys' parents discovered Bobi was alive, \"it was too late to put him down, so Bobi became a part of the family,” Guinness reported.\n\nBobi led a life full of love and celebration despite the rocky start.\n\nHis family threw the senior dog “a lavish birthday party” with than 100 guests to celebrate his supposed 31st birthday. Bobi died about 165 days after his birthday celebration.\n\nHe was described by his owner as \"one of a kind\" – adding that his family was \"very happy and grateful to life for allowing us, after 30 years, to have Bobi in our daily lives.\"\n\nBobi's family hasn't publicly addressed Guinness' decision.\n\nWhat did the formal review by Guinness World Records find?\n\nThe reason why Guinness World Records revoked Bob’s record title was because they couldn’t prove the canine’s age with the evidence provided.\n\nA central piece of evidence tied to Bobi’s preliminary application was 2022 microchip data from a government database that did “not require proof of age for dogs born before 2008.”\n\n“With the additional veterinary statement provided as evidence for Bobi’s age also citing this microchip data, we’re left with no conclusive evidence which can definitively prove Bobi’s date of birth,” Mark McKinley, director of records said in a statement.\n\nMckinley added that Guinness “simply can’t retain Bobi as the record holder and honestly claim to maintain the high standards we set ourselves.”\n\nWill a new record holder be named?\n\nEventually, but probably not for a while.\n\nThe investigation into Bobi’s age was one of the reasons for the move, with Mckinley saying that it would take a “long time for microchip uptake around the world to catch up with pet ownership. Especially, older pets.”\n\n“Until that time, we'll require documentary evidence for all years of a pet’s life, we'll continue to ask for vet and witness statements and we’ll also consider microchip data as well where available,” he said.\n\nGuinness is not currently in a position to confirm a new holder for world's oldest dog, but added that they “certainly hope that the publicity around the record title encourages pet owners from around the world to get in touch,” Mckinley said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/21/world-happiness-report-young-people-u-s/73051010007/", "title": "World Happiness Report: Young people are most unsatisfied in the US", "text": "Happiness and well-being among Americans has recently plummeted and a new cohort is leading the downward spiral: young people.\n\nThe World Happiness Report released Wednesday showed that self-reported data from those under 30 knocked the U.S. out of the top 20 happiest countries for the first time since the annual report was initially published in 2012.\n\nThe analysis, compiled by Gallup, the United Nations and other groups, found that, among the top factors contributing to the rapid decline, were young people’s dissatisfaction with their support system; their living situation; waning confidence in the government and a sense that they have less freedom to make life choices, said Lara Aknin, an editor of the report and a professor of social psychology at Simon Fraser University.\n\nYoung Americans who spoke with USA TODAY pointed to the economy, the cost of housing, student loan debt, political polarization, social media, climate change and the war in Gaza as reasons for their unhappiness and disillusionment.\n\nRecent studies have shown suicide rates among young people in the U.S. has surged, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts have also begun to sound the alarm over what many consider to be an epidemic of loneliness among America’s teenagers and young adults, which has coincided with a rise in virtual school and remote work. But researchers agree that there’s no one cause for the decline, rather a cluster of factors that’s driving young people to dissatisfaction levels associated with those who typically are at least a decade older.\n\n“Youths have reached the point of a midlife crisis – today,” said Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, professor of economics and behavioral science at Oxford’s Saïd Business School and a publisher of the World Happiness Report. “That's really disconcerting because then, obviously, it begs the question, where's it going to go from here?”\n\nWhat is causing the dissatisfaction?\n\nYoung millennials and Gen Zers said everything from crippling debt and inflated rent prices to social media's comparison culture has left them exhausted and unsatisfied.\n\nAshlie Marchant, a sophomore at the University of Central Florida, said social media was the biggest cause of dissatisfaction in her life and the lives of her friends. Along with deleting TikTok off her phone, Merchant, sitting in a public park with a paperback novel, said she's embraced physical media like film photography and vinyl records in an effort to stave off a compulsion to doom scroll.\n\n“I’m trying to lean off of social media,” Marchant, 20, said. “It’s so easy to get caught up in it, and all it does is make me unproductive and upset.”\n\nLuke Liptak, a recent graduate from Savannah College of Art and Design, said though he’s not unhappy, he is buried in student loans and is struggling to find work in his field of study, computer animation.\n\n“I think a big part of this is feeling unsuccessful,” the 23-year-old said. “There's a very high expectation on young people to get married by this age or buy a house at this age, but it’s not realistic anymore.”\n\nMental health clinics across the country have reported trends similar to those identified in the World Happiness Report.\n\nDavid Rosmarin, the founder of the Center for Anxiety and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said the study confirmed what he’s seen on the ground. He said the severity of mental health illnesses and issues among younger patients has worsened since the pandemic, leading many to drop out of school or lose their jobs.\n\n“I can't count the number of college students coming to our programs who are losing semesters because of their mental health,” said Rosmarin, whose clinics operate in three states across the Northeast. “Every dean who I've spoken to has an inbox full of mental health leave requests.”\n\nMore: Youth and social mediaOhio, more states push for social media laws to limit kids’ access: Where they stand\n\nWill this only get worse?\n\nResearchers say one of the best predictors of adult happiness is happiness as a child and as a teenager. And happiness and satisfaction levels are related to people’s physical health, academic achievement, civic engagement and financial earnings.\n\nThis correlation is fueling concerns that as teenagers and young adults in the U.S. get older, their dissatisfaction may only worsen, as history suggests.\n\nGenerally, happiness is greatest among young people and drops to its lowest around middle age (40-60) before climbing up again as people reach retirement and old age – a phenomenon commonly called the U-shape. While a general flattening has been a yearslong trend in the U.S., this year the shape has become unrecognizable, experts said.\n\n“Honestly, I look at these data with terror, not just because of what they reveal about our country right now, but what they will reveal about our country in the future unless we change this pattern,” said Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology at Yale University.\n\nAknin, the Canadian professor, said it's unknown what the results on this trend will be or whether it will even continue.\n\n\"If people are starting low, is it only going to get worse before it gets better? I'm not sure we know,\" she said. \"I think there might be multiple outcomes.\"\n\nOptimism for the young\n\nSantos, who teaches Yale's most popular class, “Psychology and the Good Life,” said that while the report’s findings were similar to what she’s found in her interaction with students – increased isolation, stress and burnout – there is room for optimism.\n\nFirst, not all countries saw plummeting levels of well-being. Young people in central and eastern Europe, as well as parts of sub-Saharan Africa, reported increases in happiness, the report showed. Experts said it’s not clear why these regions are experiencing the opposite trend as the U.S., Canada and other English-speaking counties, but their results show this is not an entirely global phenomenon.\n\n“I think the record, while depressing when it came to U.S. teens, was actually quite hopeful because it tells us it doesn't have to be the pattern, and with the other factors we can switch that pattern around completely,” Santos said.\n\nAdditionally, research has long shown there are changes people can make in their own lives to improve their levels of happiness and satisfaction, like more in-person social behavior, self compassion and freeing up time separate from work, school and other obligations, Santos said. She and other experts added that while there should be more focus on structural changes, young people are not at the mercy of external factors and can improve their own well-being.\n\n“Individual behaviors, the data suggests, have a significant impact on people's happiness,” Santos said. “And what I try to convey to young people in my courses, despite these statistics, is that they have agency and they can, with their own individual actions, make changes that will allow them to do better.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/03/22/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-2/73074792007/", "title": "'Happy Gilmore' sequel has script from Adam Sandler, co-star confirms", "text": "A \"Happy Gilmore\" sequel is in the works, according to one of the original film's stars.\n\nAdam Sandler, who starred in the original sports comedy as the titular character, is involved in the project, according to Christopher McDonald.\n\nMcDonald played Happy's nemesis Shooter McGavin in the 1996 film.\n\nMcDonald revealed the project during an interview on 92.3 The Fan in Cleveland.\n\n\"Here's a quick intel,\" McDonald told host Ken Carman. \"I saw Adam about two weeks ago and he says to me 'McDonald.

How about investment guru Warren Buffett? Or Amazon founder Jeff Bezos?\n\nAll three of the billionaires are among the five richest men whose fortunes shot up by 114% since 2020, while the world was reeling during the COVID-19 pandemic, Oxfam found using figures from Forbes.

If nothing changes, one of the world's billionaires could reach trillionaire status in the next 10 years, the group said.\n\nIn the United States, where more billionaires live than in any other country on the planet, Musk is the richest with a fortune of about $2.26 billion, Oxfam's analysis of Forbes data found. Musk, Bezos and Ellison – the U.S.' three richest men – have together increased their wealth by 84% since 2020, the report concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, people worldwide are working longer hours while the wages of nearly 800 million workers haven't kept up with inflation in the last two years, Oxfam said.\n\n\"The United States is home to the most billionaires on Earth, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, names that have become synonymous with obscene wealth,\" Oxfam American President and CEO Abby Maxman said in a statement. “We must stop normalizing extreme inequality and take deliberate action to prevent the ultra-wealthy and the corporations they control from tightening their stranglehold on our politics and economy.”\n\nAnti-poverty report calls for tax reform, other measures\n\nOxfam is calling on governments to usher in \"a new era of public action\" by implementing measures to reduce or slow the widening wealth disparity.\n\nThose policies, per Oxfam, include investing in public services like education and healthcare, taxing the wealthiest people and largest corporations in every country, and breaking up monopolies to make businesses more competitive.\n\n“Every corporation has a responsibility to act but very few are,\" Behar said. \"Governments must step up.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The \"happiness costs of these risks are very large,\" according to the report.\n\nThe meme provides no source of information or date; it is possible the first claim could have been true at the time the meme was created, as Denmark has been previously ranked first in World Happiness Reports.\n\nA search of the text included in the post results in a blog post with an almost identical version of the claim from 2016, a year when Denmark was ranked first. Denmark also made the top of the list in 2012 and 2013.\n\nNordic countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, have appeared on the top 10 of the World Happiness Report since it started publishing its annual rankings in 2012. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, Nordic countries occupied the top three spots.\n\nThe report found that Nordic citizens are exceptionally satisfied with their lives because of reliable and extensive welfare benefits, low corruption, well-functioning democracy and state institutions and small population.\n\nFact check: Over 159 million people voted in the US general election\n\nWork hours, university, medical and child care\n\nBeyond overall happiness, the post makes claims — some true — about why Danes might be so happy.\n\nWhile the post states an average workweek in Denmark is 33 hours, a full-time workweek in Denmark is typically 37 hours distributed over five days, according to the city of Copenhagen. It/ notes that workweeks can be longer for those in a managerial position or self-employed.\n\nStaying extra hours is discouraged, and most employees leave the office around 4 p.m. to pick up their children and begin preparing for dinner, according to the official website of Denmark. In the last weeks of July, offices are shut down as Danes take time off to enjoy a short summer and every employee is legally entitled to five weeks of paid vacation per year.\n\nEmployees are also not allowed to work more than 48 hours per week on an average of a four month period due to the EU's Working Time Directive, which was implemented in Denmark's Working Enviornment Act in 2017.\n\nThe post states the nation's minimum wage is $20 an hour. But Denmark lacks a federally mandated minimum wage, according to Investopedia. However, trade unions work to ensure that workers are paid a reasonable rate and try to keep the average minimum wage at $20 per hour. As of 2020, minimum wages in the country hover around $16.60 per hour, according to Check In Price.\n\nMinimum-wage.org, says Denmark's average minimum wage is $18 per hour and annual minimum wage is $44,252.00. A November 2020 article from Market Watch says wages in Scandinavia are among the highest in the world at $17.69 per hour.\n\nSchooling is largely free, as the post claims. Higher education in Denmark is free for students from the European Union or European University Association and for students in exchange programs, according to the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science. Education is also free for students who have a permanent residence, a temporary residence with possibility of obtaining permanent residence or a resident permit.\n\nIt is also worth noting that every Danish student receives a rough estimate of $900 per month, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIn Denmark, the health care system is financed through an income tax of 8% and provides universal access to citizens and legal residents, USA TODAY reported. So while the post states medical care is free, it lacks the context that taxpayers do cover the cost.\n\nThe public child care system in Denmark is based on a partially free system, and some day care institutions have waiting lists. However, most guarantee a place for children from the age of 1, according to Work in Denmark. The child care facilities receive financial support from the state and the most payable out of pocket amount by parents is 30% of the cost. Child care is not free, as claimed.\n\nThe reason Denmark can afford to provide these services is because it has one of the highest tax rates in the world, with the average Dane paying a total of 45% in income taxes, according to BBC. In fact, most Scandinavian countries offer higher education, child and medical care, and parental leave due to their high levels of taxation. In 2018, Denmark's tax-to-GDP ratio was 44.9%, Norway's was 39% and Sweden's 43.9%, which compares to a ratio of 24.3% in the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe post is accurate in claiming that Denmark has low corruption. The 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Denmark as the least corrupt country in the world for the fifth year in a row due to its degree of press freedom, access to information, independent judicial systems and strong standards of integrity for public officials.\n\nIn 2018, New Zealand and Denmark were both ranked as the least corrupt, according to World Population Review, which notes that there is no exact way to measure corruption but many use the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International.\n\nFact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot\n\nOur ruling: Partly False\n\nThe claim that Denmark is ranked the happiest country in the world due to its short workweeks, high minimum wage, and free university and health and child care is rated PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world for the last three consecutive years, with Denmark holding a spot in the top three. Denmark also has 37-hour workweeks, not 33, and there is no minimum wage. Services of higher education, child and medical care and parental leave are available due to their high levels of taxation; they're not offered for free.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

It featured recipes, travel guides and beauty tips, as well as interviews with highly successful women including Elizabeth Hurley, Ivanka Trump and Priyanka Chopra.\n\nClosing The Tig in 2017 was “among the sacrifices” Markle made when she entered royal life, said Tatler.

Markle said in the site’s bio that a sip of this wine suddenly made her understand “what people meant by the body, legs, structure of wine”. It was “an aha moment at its finest”, she wrote. And so Tig became Markle’s “shorthand for the feeling of suddenly understanding something”, said The Cut.\n\nThough the blog may have closed, “thankfully, nothing on the internet is ever truly gone for good”, said Cosmopolitan. And “ever since the site was excised from the web”, The Tig “has become a source of fascination”, said Grazia. Its content reveals “unexpected insights” on its founder’s “attitude to life”.\n\n“She’s fully sold on meditation,” the magazine recounted, but was not such a fan of baking: “There’s something about the technicality of it that stifles my inner rebel; no dash of this or extra spoonful of that.”\n\nElizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray Love inspired the future duchess to spend a month in Italy, and her favourite drink at the time was “red wine hot chocolate”, a concoction that she said “combines two of every lady’s classic loves, wine and chocolate”. She’s also a strong “advocate” for “alone time”.\n\nFarewell friends\n\nMarkle bid farewell to her “passion project” in a post published in 2017. She thanked her “amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity” for “three beautiful years” of “adventure”.\n\nIt was “the end of an era” for Markle, said People. There was speculation that the site’s closure was due to the future duchess’s relationship with Prince Harry, which had recently been made public. A source told the site that those reports were “false” and that the project was brought to an end so that Markle could focus on shooting the upcoming season of US TV drama Suits.\n\nBut earlier this month The Mirror reported that Markle could be preparing to go “head-to-head with Gwyneth Paltrow” in the lifestyle blogosphere again by taking on the “mega-successful” Goop. Documents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office indicate that “a potentially rebooted version” of The Tig could be in the pipeline, said the New York Post.\n\nTwig take two?\n\nMarkle previously renewed The Tig’s trademark in 2019, sparking speculation that she could be planning to relaunch the site. But her spokesperson told People that the trademark’s continuation was to “prevent false branding, to avoid others purporting to be the Duchess or affiliated with her”.\n\nNow, “having taken her final curtsy as a working royal”, Markle is “in a different position”, said The Cut. With a podcast, books and Netflix documentary already among her and Prince Harry’s post-royal projects, “why not add a blog to the roster?”\n\nA revival of The Tig “could open up a new avenue for the duchess’s independent career”, said Tatler. According to the filed documents, Markle might also “take on an agony aunt role on the site”, providing “commentary in the field of personal relationships”, said the Mirror.\n\nSome commentators are sceptical about the prospect of Tig 2.0. “Behind every successful female lifestyle brand is the straightforward science of envy,” said Celia Walden in The Telegraph. “But how many women want Markle’s life? Personally, I don’t know any.”\n\nDaniela Elser in the New Zealand Herald agreed that a new chapter of The Tig would be a “disastrous idea”. But the trademark’s renewal may prove to be nothing more than evidence that “a canny lawyer” is trying to ensure “no enterprising sorts can get their mitts” on The Tig “to sell Sussex merch”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Jamie Timson", "Catherine Garcia", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/08/07/suits-on-netflix-why-duchess-meghans-old-show-is-so-popular-now/70541665007/", "title": "'Suits' on Netflix': Why this old show is so popular now", "text": "New TV shows are fun, but have you ever tried watching a USA Network legal drama from 2011 instead?\n\nThat's what many millions of Netflix subscribers have decided, as \"Suits,\" a slightly silly drama about corporate lawyers that starred Meghan Markle before she became a duchess, has climbed to the top of the streamer's charts. Despite airing its last episodes on USA in 2019, and being available to stream on other platforms like Hulu and Amazon Prime before this, “Suits” is suddenly at the top of everyone’s queues.\n\nSo why is this particular show, about a genius pretending to be a lawyer and the hoity-toity New York law firm he works for, suddenly trending? We explain.\n\nWhat is ‘Suits’ about?\n\n“Suits” follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), a chronic underachiever with a photographic memory who so impresses big-shot lawyer Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), that Harvey takes Mike on as an associate at his firm, in spite of the fact that Mike has never been to law school. Mike ends up being shockingly effective as a fake lawyer, and he and Harvey take on cases while trying to keep their deception a secret.\n\nAt the elite law firm of Pearson Hardman, Harvey and Mike are helped by Donna (Sarah Rafferty), Harvey’s legal secretary and close friend (maybe more than that) and paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle, now Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex), who becomes Mike’s friend, confidante and maybe something more. They are all watched over by the firm’s no-nonsense boss Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). After Meghan left the show in 2018 (she left her acting career to marry Prince Harry) Katherine Heigl joined.\n\nWhy are people suddenly watching ‘Suits’ on Netflix?\n\nAlthough “Suits” has been available to stream on other platforms before and now it’s also on Peacock, it joined Netflix’s roster this summer and quickly caught on in popularity. It has now broken its own record for most watched minutes on an “acquired” TV show (not one debuted by a streamer), with 3.1 billion minutes viewed in a single week this July, according to Nielsen.\n\nCall it the Netflix effect. Many shows that debuted elsewhere have found new life and popularity on the platform before, including “You,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Breaking Bad” and “Schitt’s Creek.” Netflix is the biggest streamer, and a series that might get buried somewhere else can shine when the algorithm puts them in front of hundreds of millions of users.\n\nBut it’s not just that. We are in the middle of a historic summer for the entertainment industry as the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild are both on strike. The writers have been striking for three months, which has slowed the pipeline of new shows premiering on streaming and broadcast TV. The fewer new shows Netflix’s algorithm has to serve to its audience, the more likely something like “Suits” can break out big.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that “Suits” has 134 episodes to binge-watch (most new Netflix series have far fewer) and has always been a rollicking good time of a TV series. The appeal of “Suits” is in the ease of watching. The dialogue is fast and pleasing to the ear, the plots are engaging without being too complex and the people are pretty and they have pretty people problems. Can Mike keep his secret? Can Rachel fulfill her dreams of becoming a lawyer? Will Harvey and Donna ever tell each other how they really feel? Will the law firm survive?\n\n“Suits” is from an era of USA when the network invested in so-called “blue sky” programming, the kind of easy-going, lightweight TV shows that you can watch while folding laundry. Think “Royal Pains,” “Monk” and “In Plain Sight.” There’s a little comedy, a little drama, a little mystery, a little heartbreak, a little joy, but never too much of any one thing.\n\nAnd don’t underestimate the royal elephant in the room. She may not have been a duchess while filming “Suits,” but her renown and celebrity is probably a factor in some people clicking play when they see her photo above the show’s logo.\n\nWhy isn’t ‘Suits’ Season 9 on Netflix?\n\nOld TV shows bounce around streaming services all the time, and sometimes different seasons are on different platforms because of licensing agreements between the streamers and the studios that own the TV shows. “Suits” Season 9 isn’t on Netflix, but you can watch it on both Amazon Prime Video and Peacock.\n\nI’ve finished all 9 seasons of ‘Suits.’ What should I watch next?\n\nSo you’ve binged through all of Harvey Spector’s shenanigans but you’re craving more legal drama with a hefty suspension of disbelief? Don’t worry, there’s a “Suits” spinoff about Torres’ Jessica Pearson, aptly called “Pearson.” However, it only ran for one 10-episode season and isn’t available to stream for free, only to purchase digitally.\n\nBut check out these shows if you want more of the fun, addictive, case-of-the-week high jinks that “Suits” delivered:\n\n◾ “White Collar” (streaming on Amazon Prime and Hulu): Matt Bomer got his start on this USA Network drama about a con man given a reprieve from prison to assist the FBI in solving white-collar crimes. Bomer has the same charm and smarm as Adams, and the series has a great blend of weekly mysteries to solve and long-running plots.\n\n◾ “Psych” (streaming on Peacock and Amazon Prime): If you enjoyed the part of “Suits” where Mike was running a long con as a lawyer you may enjoy another fakeout. “Psych” follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday Rodriguez), a detective pretending to be a psychic. Sillier (but way funnier) than “Suits,” “Psych” has eight seasons and three movies to enjoy.\n\n◾ “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” (streaming on Amazon Prime and Paramount+): If you’re looking for legal drama more than anything else, you can find none better than “Wife” and its spinoff, “Fight.” Both about lawyers in Chicago facing moral quandaries, relationship drama and the absurdity of life, they are definitely worth spending your binge-watching time on.\n\n◾ “The Lincoln Lawyer” (streaming on Netflix): It doesn’t have nearly as many episodes to enjoy, but Netflix's adaptation of the Michael Connelly books is the streamer’s attempt at a home-grown “Suits”-like phenomenon.

The CW even acknowledged the royal baby news, tweeting a promo of the latest episode and writing, \"Proud to be Archie\" with a baby and a crown emoji.\n\nArchie Bunker\n\nMeghan's comment that baby Archie has the \"sweetest temperament\" certainly didn't always ring true for Archibald \"Archie\" Bunker (Carroll O'Connor), the popular '70s TV character from \"All in the Family\" and spin-off \"Archie Bunker's Place,\" known for his satirical gruffness, bigotry and \"Bunkerisms.\"\n\nArchie Manning\n\nWhile royal Archie has famous parents, former NFL quarterback Archie Manning has two exceedingly famous sons: NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning. Archie Manning played for 13 seasons in the league, spending most of his career with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nArchie Griffin\n\nMaybe the youngest royal will be a star athlete? Archie Griffin is another former football player with the name. Griffin is a former NFL running back who played multiple seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. He is known for being the only college football player to win the Heisman Trophy twice.\n\nArchie Arnett\n\nThe young royal isn't the only kid on the block with that name. Amy Poehler and Will Arnett's eldest son shares the name Archie – and he's only 10. We wonder if Meghan, who was an actress before wedding Harry, found some inspiration from her Hollywood peers.\n\nArchie Panjabi\n\nNot all Archies have to be men! Actress Archie Panjabi is best known for her role as Kalinda Sharma on \"The Good Wife,\" which earned her an Emmy Award. Another fun fact: Panjabi is also a Brit like the little royal.\n\nArchie \"Snake\" Simpson\n\nFor any \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" fans, you might fondly remember Archie \"Snake\" Simpson (Stefan Brogren), the principal at the titular school who became Emma's stepfather. Maybe royal Archie will have a cool nickname as well?\n\nArchie Kao\n\nIf the royal baby becomes an actor like his mom, maybe he'll be like actor Archie Kao, who played a character also named Archie during his 11 years on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\" Kao is also known for his recurring roles on TV series \"Chicago P.D.\" and \"ER.\"\n\nArchie Christie\n\nIf there was any doubt that Archie wasn't a traditional name (or a British one), look no further than fellow Brit Archie Christie.

Known as the Letters Patent, the edict said that all children and grandchildren of the sovereign through a male line can hold the titles of prince and princess.\n\nPrince Edward, the youngest of the Queen’s children and currently the Earl of Wessex, could become the Duke of Edinburgh, with his wife Sophie becoming the Duchess of Edinburgh, although no official title change has yet been made.\n\nCan titles be removed?\n\nThe Queen stripped Prince Andrew of his honorary military titles and patronages after a US judge ruled that a civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations against him could proceed to trial in January 2022.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced the decision following the publication of an open letter signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans that urged the Queen to remove her second son’s eight British military titles.\n\nSome of these titles were inherited by Andrew from his late father, Prince Philip, including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, described by the BBC as “one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army”.\n\nBut Andrew “has not lost everything”, wrote Craig Prescott, a law lecturer at Bangor University, in an article on The Conversation. Along with his rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy, Andrew retains his birth title of “prince” and “remains the Duke of York, which is a peerage”, Prescott explained. And he is also still ninth in line of succession to the throne.\n\nHow the peerage works\n\nThe peerage is a centuries-old ranking system for British nobility. Five ranks of the peerage still exist today: duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron.\n\nDuke is the “highest and most important rank”, explained online history magazine Historic UK. Edward III created the first duke, in 1337, when he made his eldest son the Duke of Cornwall – a title now held by Prince William. Dukes (and duchesses, the female counterpart) are addressed as “your grace”.\n\nAndrew became Duke of York when he married Sarah Ferguson in 1986. The title is traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son and has previously been held by the Queen’s father, George VI, and her grandfather, George V.\n\nUnlike military titles, Andrew’s peerage can only be removed by an Act of Parliament. A peerage removal “can only be done by statute, passed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and receiving royal assent, which means the agreement of the Queen”, said the i news site.\n\nCalls for Andrew to lose his dukedom have been growing, particularly in York, where a city council member has launched a campaign backing the move.\n\nBut there is no historical precedent for the removal of a title of peerage by the Queen: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex despite quitting royal life in January 2020.\n\nOther ranks of the peerage\n\nA marquess, which is next in the line of nobility after a duke, is formally addressed as “lord”, and the wife of a marquess is a marchioness, addressed as “lady”. Only one woman in history has been created a marchioness in her own right: Anne Boleyn, prior to her marriage to Henry VIII.\n\nThe next rank in order of precedence is earl. The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon “eorl”, meaning military leader. After earl comes viscount, a title created in the 15th century, and then baron, a name derived from the Old German word “baro”, meaning freeman.\n\nTitles of the peerage may be hereditary or granted for life. Historically, hereditary peers have had the right to sit in the House of Lords. However, following the House of Lords Act of 1999, most hereditary peers have now been “ejected”, with fewer than 100 remaining.\n\nThese days, new hereditary peerages are only granted by the Queen to members of the Royal Family. According to The Independent, the grandchildren of sons of the reigning monarch are automatically given the title of “prince” or “princess”, but any title beyond that – such as duke or duchess – “is granted by courtesy”.\n\nThe meaning of HRH\n\nHRH (His or Her Royal Highness) titles have been issued to children and grandchildren of the monarch since the early 18th century, at the discretion of the monarchs of the time.\n\n“Not everyone has accepted the offer of an HRH,” said CNN. The Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, turned it down for her children, Peter and Zara.\n\n“That’s in contrast to Prince Andrew, who allowed his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, to carry it,” added the US-based news network.\n\nPrince Andrew still retains his HRH title – described by The New York Times as “a prized symbol of his status as a senior member of the Royal Family” – but he will not be able to use it in any official capacity. This puts him on the same footing as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex following their move to California.\n\nAndrew and the Sussexes are not the first Royals to be prevented from using the HRH titles. The Queen also stripped Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson of the title following their divorces from Charles and Andrew respectively. Diana was instead given the courtesy title of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nHow royal patronages work\n\nMembers of the Royal Family lend their name to a charity or organisation in a show of royal support that can provide “vital publicity” for a cause and “add status”, according to the family’s official website.\n\nAs well as losing his honorary military titles and the use of HRH, Andrew has also been stripped of his many royal patronages. In November 2019, “when the Duke of York stepped down from public duties, he held 230 patronages”, said the i news site.\n\nAndrew’s patronages were returned to the Queen and redistributed to other members of the Royal Family.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Adrienne Wyper", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/us/957679/where-do-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-live", "title": "Where do Prince Harry and Meghan Markle live? | The Week", "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were ordered to leave their California home amid devastating floods in the state that killed at least 17 people this week.\n\nAuthorities issued an evacuation order on Monday for Montecito, Santa Barbara, with warnings of mudslides.

The 1,324 square feet (123 square metre) property was described by the prince as “really small, on a slight lean with low ceilings”.\n\nThe documentary hurled the pair back into the spotlight with revelations about the inner workings of the royal family and further accusations of bullying.\n\nHowever, the six-part Netflix series was not actually filmed in their own home in California, where they moved to in July 2020, but rather “a nine-minute drive away from where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex live with their children”, reported Marie Claire.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday reported that the series’ location, with its “sweeping vistas over the Pacific Ocean, majestic oak ceiling and impeccably designed interior”, is in fact a £27.3m mansion, addressed 888 Lilac Lane, which is currently up for sale down the road from the couple’s own estate in Montecito.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan officially stepped down from royal duties in 2020 amid what The New York Times described as an “extraordinary retreat”.

It’s “a full two hours northwest of downtown LA by car, but celebrities have flocked to the area in recent years”, said Dirt.com.\n\nThe area’s “laid-back and mostly paparazzi-free atmosphere provides a welcome retreat from the hectic hustle of Hollywood and its surrounding environs”. The celebrity real estate site reported that Ellen DeGeneres, Ariana Grande and Gwyneth Paltrow are also residents of the area.\n\nThe home of the Duke and Duchess is situated on a private road and features “a lengthy driveway and large security gates”, said Hello! It’s officially known as the Chateau of Riven Rock.\n\nWhat’s the property like?\n\nMultimillionaire software boss Terry Cunningham told The Mail on Sunday that he and his wife Randi had originally bought the 5.4 acres of land to build “the house of their dreams” in 1999, with the property completed four years later.\n\nHe described it as “a beautiful French country house”, inspired by a holiday the couple had enjoyed in the south of France. As well as being “very private”, he described it as “a wonderful place to have lots of family around”.\n\nAccording to Hello!, the house has “a grand total of nine bedrooms and 16 bathrooms”, as well as a library, office, spa, gym, games room, cinema, wine cellar and five-car garage. A separate guest house also has two bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nCunningham said: “The kitchen is probably one of the coolest rooms in the house. It opens on to the side patio where the pizza oven and outdoor tables are. Living in Montecito, there’s a lot of indoor-outdoor lifestyle, so you easily move from decks to indoors.”\n\nThe “Mediterranean-style main house includes a trove of beige and off-white decor”, said Dirt. “Oozing sophistication”, Markle’s office “is an oasis of calm with its natural tones and rustic furniture”, said Hello!, while the living room is “decked out with modern artwork, fresh flowers, candles and organic pottery”.\n\nThe garden is “beautifully landscaped” with “tiered rose gardens, olive trees and cypress trees”, said Architectural Digest. There is a “tennis court, a swimming pool, and a chicken coop”, which featured in the couple’s “bombshell” TV interview with Winfrey, broadcast in 2021.\n\nArchie and Lilibet can also enjoy “an adventure playground, a climbing frame, a helter-skelter, and two different climbing walls”, said Hello!. Metro reported that there is a “tea house” and a “children’s cottage” as well.\n\nWho paid for the house?\n\nIn 2020, a source told US Weekly that Harry “could’ve asked [Prince] Charles to contribute toward the cost of the house”, but he “chose not to” go to his father, as it would “result in the royals having control over him” and would “mean going backwards”.\n\nThe couple “paid out of their own pockets” instead and “have taken out a huge mortgage”, said the source. The estate cost an “unquestionably hefty” $14.65m (£12.12m), said Dirt, and a $9.5m (£7.9m) mortgage was secured to make the purchase.\n\nOmid Scobie, royal correspondent and co-author of Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, told Entertainment Today that the Sussexes “are extremely liquid when it comes to their assets”.\n\nHe added: “Harry brings a lot to the table himself and Meghan lives off residuals from Suits and the many appearances that she’s done in other projects too.” In the tell-all interview with Winfrey in 2021, Harry said money left to him by his late mother, Princess Diana, meant he was able to support himself financially.\n\nUS Weekly said the couple were “proud of their purchase” and saw it as “the next step toward their long future together”.\n\nWill they stay there?\n\nReports first emerged in January last year that the Sussexes were thinking of selling their Californian home. A source told The Mirror: “They want to stay in the neighbourhood or nearby but they aren’t over the moon about the house and the location.”\n\nAt the end of October, similar reports appeared in the Daily Express that the couple were “looking for a new place” in Hope Ranch, a community just ten miles from their current Montecito property.\n\nAccording to the Express’s Dorothy Reddin: “The family of four’s potential new neighbourhood includes not only a members-only country club and a golf club, but also tennis courts, picnic grounds, and a network of equestrian trails.”\n\nHouse & Garden reported that the rumoured move was due to a “series of break-ins” at the couple’s current residence. While the two locations “offer similar advantages”, the magazine continued, “Hope Ranch, however, offers somewhat more privacy and security than Montecito”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/07/03/duchess-meghan-duchess-kate-help-bloggers-earn-money-their-fashion/1637756001/", "title": "Duchess Meghan, Duchess Kate help bloggers earn money with ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nOKEMOS, Mich. (AP) — From Meghan the Duchess of Sussex's recent maternity clothing to Kate the Duchess of Cambridge's love of L.K.

The site actually launched before Meghan started dating Prince Harry, because Ross' co-editor, Amanda Dishaw of Toronto, was a fan of Markle's TV series \"Suits.\"\n\nOnce Harry and Meghan were spotted together in public, the actress' profile went up. And so did visits to their site.\n\n\"When Meghan was seen at the Invictus Games with Prince Harry in Toronto, it just exploded, and all of a sudden it was like, 'OK, this is serious. This is real. This is happening,'\" said Ross. \"People were so interested in what she wore and the charities that she worked with and the messages that she was sending, and the site just really took off from there.\"\n\nSo, how exactly do these bloggers figure out who the duchesses are wearing?\n\nKelley says for official engagements, the Palace provides a minimal amount of information about the clothing worn.\n\n\"Kensington Palace will tell reporters at the scene the primary designer she's wearing,\" said Kelley, adding that the Palace doesn't reveal who made Kate's accessories.\n\nShame on us!:Duchess Meghan changed her engagement ring and we didn't even notice\n\nBut it also comes down to a study in repetition.\n\n\"Kate has designers that she goes to again and again,\" Kelley said.\n\nFor Meghan's Mirror, Ross says she and her team have studied fashion and will examine the Duchess of Sussex's wardrobe down to the tiniest of details to get it right.\n\n\"Every time there's a new picture of Meghan, whether it's a paparazzi photo or an official event, there's a mad rush to our computers, and we really just start Googling,\" she said. \"It comes down to a really unique knowledge of the brands that she loves.

Every month, the account follows a handful of new charity accounts – unfollowing all previous accounts – in favor of promoting different organizations working for different causes.\n\nIn June, Harry and Meghan announced their plans to launch a separate charity foundation by the end of the year, leaving the Royal Foundation to Prince William and Duchess Kate for their own charitable work.\n\nSince Harry and Meghan's May 2018 wedding, the younger couple has been vocal about a desire to tackle charity causes they are especially passionate about.\n\nIn its announcement, Kensington Palace said the changes are the \"conclusions of a review into the structure\" of the Royal Foundation, the charitable umbrella organization originally created for Will and Kate and Harry; Meghan was added after she married Harry.\n\n\"Later this year the Royal Foundation will become the principal charitable and philanthropic vehicle for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge,\" the palace statement said. \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will establish their own new charitable foundation with transitional operating support from The Royal Foundation.

Plans for the “non-profit empire” were first shared in April 2020, and were “far more extensive” than those originally drawn up for Prince Harry and his wife under their philanthropic brand Sussex Royal, said The Telegraph. Ambitiously, Archewell aims to “unleash the power of compassion to drive systemic cultural change”, according to its website.\n\nThe charitable prong of the endeavour is the Archewell Foundation, while “creative activations” are taken care of under Archewell Audio and Productions. For months there’s been “silence” from the audio department, said Marie Claire, but there are signs it is “revving up for its grand debut” in the coming months, with a spokesperson telling the magazine that content will launch “later in 2021”.\n\nWhile his father and brother “could not have done more” to help “set the tone” at Cop26, said Sky News’ royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills, Harry and his wife have also made their own environmental commitments in the past week. The couple have announced that Archewell will reach net zero carbon emissions by the end of the decade.\n\nStreaming stars\n\nThe Sussexes “unveiled new Hollywood careers” in September 2020 with a “megawatt Netflix deal”, said The New York Times. The “multiyear” agreement gives the couple a “global platform” through the mediums of “documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and children’s programming”. Harry took on the role of executive producer on Heart of Invictus, a behind-the-scenes docu-series of the 2020 Invictus Games, while Markle has been working on an animated series titled Pearl.\n\nThe deal was reportedly worth between $100m (£75m) and $150m (£133m), and could see the couple “appear on camera”, though Markle herself has “no plans to return to acting”, the newspaper continued.\n\nBut some are now calling on Harry to “tear up” the deal and “make a stand” against the portrayal of his mother in the streaming platform’s hit series The Crown, said the Daily Mail. Jemima Khan, a friend of the late Princess Diana, stepped back from her role on the programme which, she said, hadn’t handled the story “as respectfully or compassionately as she had hoped”.\n\nLiterary undertakings\n\nIn June, Markle published her first children's book, The Bench. “Inspired by Meghan’s own family experience,” said Harper’s Bazaar, Markle explained that the story began as a poem written for her husband for Father’s Day.\n\nThe book, which has earned a middling 3.5 stars on Good Reads, consists of “a series of vignettes” featuring a father and son whose relationship “is sketched out in a series of banalities and badly constructed rhymes”, said The Critic. The story “clearly comes from the heart” and is “likely to pull at the heart strings of parents, grandparents and carers”, said The Independent. But it is “unlikely to win any literary awards”.\n\nChristian Robinson’s “pleasant and accomplished” illustrations show a “strong and obvious resemblance to Prince Harry” in the father character, said The Critic, and The Independent described the book as “full of personal references to the Sussexes”. Even so, Markle said she hoped to depict the father-son bond “through an inclusive lens” that would resonate “with every family, no matter the makeup”.\n\n“It’s mind-boggling how bad this book is,” said The New Statesman. But “no doubt The Bench will be a bestseller,” The Critic continued. “It is bad, of course” but “it is too inconsequential and ephemeral to merit the vitriol of a proper disembowelling”, and should instead be “regarded as a curiosity”.\n\nBirthday plans\n\nAs part of her 40th birthday celebrations in August, Markle “offered a gift to the world”, said Glamour magazine. Via a video starring Markle and Melissa McCarthy, the duchess announced she would be asking 40 friends to donate 40 minutes of their time to mentoring women re-entering the workforce.\n\nConcerned that “tens of millions” of women had left work during the pandemic, Markle wrote on the Archewell website that she believes “mentorship is one way to help women regain confidence and rebuild their economic strength”.\n\nThough Glamour described the campaign as a “powerful initiative”, “it was attacked from the start”, said the Mirror. Some critics said “that little could be achieved during a 40 minute session”, and that 40x40 “is more about [Markle] trying to look good”.\n\nTell-all interview\n\n“I think we will be talking about the interview for 20 years,” journalist Tina Brown told CBS News in March this year. Her comments followed the Sussexes’ “bombshell” two-hour long interview with Oprah Winfrey, which included claims that comments had been made by an unnamed member of the royal family about the colour of their son’s skin, as well as details of Markle’s treatment by the British press and lack of support from the Windsors which contributed to her having suicidal thoughts, said Sky News.\n\nThe couple drew both “praise and vitriol”, said The Guardian, and “differences of opinion were not merely transatlantic”. Piers Morgan described the interview as “an orgy of pious, self-indulgent, score-settling twaddle”, and former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore told the BBC’s Today programme the couple were “self-absorbed and irrelevant”, while Keir Starmer said the allegations made ought to be taken “very, very seriously”.\n\nVoices of support came particularly from women of colour, who saw “the decision to raise allegations of racism and mistreatment as necessary and even heroic”, the newspaper continued.\n\n“Whatever you think of the couple’s revelations, in purely journalistic terms, Oprah delivered a masterpiece,” film and TV critic Caryn James said on the BBC. And “one erstwhile member of the Royal Family came out of the interview looking extraordinarily well”, said the New Yorker, referring to Princess Diana. Harry explained to Winfrey that the inheritance from his mother had helped his family after they were cut off financially from the Windsors. “Americans always liked her best,” said the magazine.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Adrienne Wyper", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Richard Windsor", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2021/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/royals/960442/prince-harry-coronation-royal-rift", "title": "King's coronation: does Prince Harry's return signal end of royal rift ...", "text": "Prince Harry has confirmed that he will attend the King’s coronation next month, albeit without his wife Meghan Markle, amid growing hopes that father and son will be reconciled.\n\nAfter weeks of “delicate negotiations”, described by the Daily Mail as a game of “transatlantic ping pong”, Prince Harry will attend the coronation on 6 May, but Meghan and their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet will remain at their home in California.\n\nHarry’s trip to the UK will be little more than a flying visit, with the Duke of Sussex expected to attend just the Westminster Abbey coronation service and spend little personal time with the royal family.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Royal sources told the paper that his decision to attend has “pleased” the King, who is “keen to have the support of both his sons at the ceremony”.\n\nThe paper added that there had been “growing speculation that the pair may even have spoken in recent weeks”. But Prince Harry’s relationship with his brother William is still said to be “fraught”, with the heir to the throne understood to feel “deeply betrayed by the many personal family revelations the Duke has made in his memoir” and other media interviews.\n\nHarry had been said to be holding out for “peace talks” with his family over the royal rift, but has decided to attend the coronation “regardless”. His decision is said to have “prompted positive conversations that both sides hope will pave the way, in the longer term, for reconciliation between father and son”.\n\nOne source told The Telegraph: “It is about showing up, showing support and being there for his father. It was a very personal decision, not a PR one.”\n\nA source told The Sun that the King “is happy that Harry, his son, who he calls his ‘darling boy’ will be at the Abbey”. The King is “very disappointed that he won’t see Meghan or his grandchildren but understands the situation”.\n\n“The ‘Will they? Won’t they?’ question of whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would attend has hung over King Charles’s coronation for months,” said Caroline Davies in The Guardian. Organisers have been “increasingly impatient” with the pair, who were formally invited by email a month ago and missed the deadline for a response, which passed last week.\n\nBut the announcement that Harry will attend the ceremony, without Meghan, is just as likely to “fuel the narrative that difficulties between the couple and the palace remain very real, with some undoubtedly interpreting Meghan’s decision to stay away as a snub”.\n\nHarry’s solo trip could be down to a failure in negotiations, suggested royal historian and author Robert Lacey to the paper. With the invitation going out a month ago, “it seems the result of the best part of a month’s discussions and negotiations have not worked”.\n\nIngrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, suggested that Meghan’s non-attendance at the coronation is a “double insult” to her father-in-law who “walked her down the aisle in her hour of need” after her father, Thomas Markle, was too ill to attend her 2018 wedding. “I don’t think Meghan wanted to risk being sat in the hinterland at the Abbey,” she added.\n\nOmid Scobie, the royal commentator and author who is thought to be close to the couple and co-authored their biography Finding Freedom, tweeted: “I understand that Archie’s fourth birthday (also on May 6) played a factor in the couple’s decision. Expect it to be a fairly quick trip to the UK for Prince Harry, who will only be attending the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nYesterday’s announcement has finally put an end to months of speculation surrounding the highly anticipated event, allowing organisers to move forward with finalising arrangements. The Sun said it understood the seating plan had already been prepared and is now ready to be signed off.\n\nBut commentator Rob Jobson, author of the upcoming book Our King: Charles II – The Man and the Monarch Revealed, expressed doubt that Meghan will ever attend another official palace event.\n\nPraising Harry’s decision to attend the coronation as “the most pragmatic move in a difficult situation”, he also added that “the fact his wife is not attending means it is now highly unlikely we will ever see her attend an official or Palace event again – apart from maybe the King’s funeral”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/958901/liz-garbus-woman-behind-netflix-harry-meghan-documentary", "title": "Liz Garbus: the director behind Netflix's Harry & Meghan ...", "text": "The first three episodes of Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan may only have aired last week, but it has already created waves on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.\n\nWhile the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are no strangers to the media spotlight, the release of the highly anticipated series has brought global attention to the woman behind it: Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Liz Garbus.\n\nInitially hesitant to take on the task of documenting the couple’s break from the royal family, the project is in fact “something of a culmination of the issues Garbus has chronicled for the past two decades”, said The New York Times.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

His clients included Nelson Mandela, actors Al Pacino, Marilyn Monroe, Robert Redford and Sean Connery, First Lady Nancy Reagan and Vietnam-era whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. Her mother Ruth was a writer, therapist and social worker.\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor’s degree in history and semiotics from Brown University, Garbus interned at Harvey Weinstein’s Miramax production company. It was there she met fellow documentary maker Jonathan Stack, with whom she made her directorial debut in 1998 with a documentary called The Farm: Angola, USA, which focused on America’s most notorious and largest maximum-security prison, Louisiana State Penitentiary.\n\nThe film won Garbus the first of her two Oscar nominations, followed in 2016 for What Happened, Miss Simone?, about the life of troubled jazz singer Nina Simone.\n\nOver her 25-year career Garbus has become known for her “critically acclaimed exposés and documenting the stories of survivors”, said Hello magazine. She has also been hailed for her handling of “complicated stories, ranging from systemic injustices to the lives of troubled public figures”, CNN added.\n\nWhether it’s “social justice seen through the lens of the prison system” – The Farm: Angola, USA and Girlhood – or “uncovering the troubled personal stories” of famous yet enigmatic figures – Bobby Fischer, Marilyn Monroe and Nina Simone – mental health and righting systemic wrongs are “topics she returns to time and again”, said The New York Times.\n\nIn 2019, Garbus and her husband, producer Dan Cogan who previously ran documentary finance company Impact Partners which won an Oscar for Icarus, formed their own production company, Story Syndicate. The couple have a daughter, Amelia, and a son, Theodore.\n\nWhy did she want to direct Harry & Meghan?\n\nWith Meghan Markle “already a fan long before the two were considering working together”, she has been described by the London Evening Standard as a “natural choice” for the Netflix documentary “for many reasons”. However, Garbus was not in fact originally slated to direct the series.\n\nAccording to Page Six, the Duke and Duchess initially turned to Garrett Bradley, director of Netflix’s documentary miniseries about tennis star Naomi Osaka. But they “reportedly clashed over the direction of the show” with both sides disagreeing on the tone of the series, said the Daily Mail.\n\nIt meant the Sussex’s own production company, Archewell Productions, captured as much footage as they could before Garbus was hired. Even then it was “not all smooth sailing” for Netflix bosses and Garbus who also “clashed” with Meghan and Harry over the “content of the series, which the couple wanted to heavily edit”, Page Six claimed.\n\nAt first Garbus was “sceptical”, said The New York Times. Far from an avid royal watcher, she knew the broad strokes of the decision by the couple to leave the British royal family and had seen their interview with Oprah Winfrey, but she assumed that the “stiff upper lip emblematic of elite British society would not make for a compelling documentary – too guarded, too interested in hagiography, too much of an all-around royal pain”, said the paper. “Then she saw the footage.”\n\n“It’s very personal and raw and powerful, and it made me appreciate the incredible weight that went into their decision,” she said. “It also affirmed the choice I had made about wanting to unravel how this historic break came to be.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "David Faris", "Adrienne Wyper", "The Week Uk", "Theara Coleman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}]}

She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims.

The Democrats’ decision effectively awards 250 delegate votes to President Biden – assuming he’s still running, as he currently intends to be, next March 19.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party submitted only Biden’s name to the Secretary of State’s elections office for the primary. Florida law provides that unopposed candidates don’t appear on the ballot.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, the Minnesotan challenging Biden’s renomination, was understandably outraged. Common sense indicates he has no chance of beating Biden with some state-by-state slugfest in the primaries, capped by a tense floor fight at the Democratic National Convention. But not letting him try seems downright un-democratic, with a small “D.”\n\nIt’s smart politics for Biden, though. Poll after poll has shown that most Americans – including most Democrats – think he’s too old. And even though likely Republican nominee Donald Trump is only three and a half years younger, the president’s sometimes confused speech and stumbling stage presence makes a whole lot of voters think he’s ready for a rocking chair on his Delaware front porch.\n\nMore on the presidential race:Who's older, Joe Biden or Donald Trump? It depends how you measure | Opinion\n\nBiden, 81, can’t avoid the rigors of a tough campaign next year, so the Democrats don’t need Phillips softening him up with a bruising but losing, primary struggle.\n\nPhillips could batter Biden like another Minnesotan pounded President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy didn’t beat LBJ in New Hampshire, but got enough of the vote to bring U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., into the race – and send Johnson home to Texas.\n\nMaybe Trump will be on cruise control by March 19, when Florida allocates 125 GOP delegates. Or maybe he’ll be slugging it out with DeSantis in a home state showdown two weeks after the 15-state “Super Tuesday” primaries. But in any event, the Republicans will put on a show.\n\nFlorida has always been strategically important in November general elections. But our presidential primary has only really mattered once.\n\nMore on the presidential race:Who's older, Joe Biden or Donald Trump? It depends how you measure | Opinion\n\nWhen the Democrats who controlled all of state government in 1972 decided to have primaries, it was a bit of a publicity gimmick, as they knew they couldn’t beat Richard Nixon. But it seemed like smart tourism marketing to have TV networks showing candidates slogging through snowbanks of Iowa and New Hampshire, in contrast to scenes of them shaking hands with swimmers on Florida beaches and families at Disney World.\n\nThe party also knew former Alabama Gov. George Wallace would lead the Florida balloting, and that there was no way under the Florida sun that Wallace could be nominated. So Scoop Jackson and Ed Muskie and John Lindsay and a bunch of other forgotten Democrats came down and fought for delegates who’d wind up nominating George McGovern, who lost 49 states.\n\nOne unintended side effect of canceling the Democratic presidential primary next March could be a windfall for Republicans, who’ll have their own closed election to draw conservatives to the polls. Some cities have piggybacked local elections on the primary date. The South Florida Sun Sentinel counted six in Broward and 19 in Palm Beach County, both Democratic strongholds.\n\nSparing Biden the prospect of losing a chunk of the Democratic vote was a smart move. But with only some nonpartisan offices, or maybe a local referendum here and there, what is there to bring Democrats to the polls?\n\nBill Cotterell is a retired capitol reporter for United Press International and the Tallahassee Democrat.

So, I'm asking you to go out there. I'm asking you to brave the elements. I'm asking you to support me and if you can trudge through some really cold weather for a few hours, you’ll launch me to be able to serve you as president for the next eight years and turn this country around.”\n\nTrump told supporters Sunday at Simpson College in Indianola to “dress warmly tomorrow night.”\n\nTrump also tempered his concerns about turnout in the weather, with snow mostly passed but wind chills expecting to result in record-low temperatures for a caucus night.\n\n\"We seem to have a lot of good enthusiasm,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, maybe the weather is not going to be that big a deal.\"\n\nTrump, Haley, DeSantis set expectations in the wake of final Iowa Poll\n\nSaturday’s poll results provided a new wrinkle for candidates as they sought to adjust the public’s expectations about how they will perform on caucus night.\n\n“I think a lot of the Iowans, they just roll their eyes at these polls. I mean, the idea that you’re gonna know in a caucus with negative-20-degree temperatures what that electorate’s gonna look like, you just can’t do it,” DeSantis said. “So it’s basically shooting into the wind.”\n\nDeSantis and his endorsers have waved away poll results for months, telling crowds in Iowa that polls are part of a “media narrative” that Trump is unbeatable.\n\nDeSantis’ top supporters, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, who endorsed him in November, spent the weekend predicting DeSantis would defy expectations and win the caucuses on Monday night.\n\n“I can tell you without hesitation, with the energy, the motivation, just what we're seeing as we travel the state: This guy is going to be the winner of the Iowa Caucus on Monday night,” Reynolds told a crowd at a Never Back Down office in West Des Moines on Saturday. “So fire up, keep this energy, we can't let down. It is game day. We got to carry it across the finish line, leave it all on the field.”\n\nThe record margin of victory in a contested Republican caucus is Bob Dole’s 12-point win in 1996.\n\nTrump told reporters Sunday that the press and analysts seem to expect him to eclipse 50% support on caucus night, saying, “there seems to be something about 50, I don’t know if we break 50.”\n\n\"I think they're doing it so that they can set a high expectation,\" Trump said. \"So if we end with 49%, which would be about 25 points bigger than anyone else has ever gotten, they can say 'it was a failure.'\"\n\nHaley has consistently said she’s looking for a “strong” finish in Iowa. On Sunday, she touted that she moved up four points in the Iowa Poll, while Trump and DeSantis dropped three points each.\n\n“There are no foregone conclusions,” Haley said at a virtual event Sunday, held after canceling an in-person event in Dubuque. “We’re already moving up in the polls. Everybody else is moving down. We see the surge.”\n\nMore:Where do I caucus? How to find Republican caucus locations, what to bring to register\n\nCandidates give their closing pitches to Iowans\n\nThe candidates also honed their final pitches to Iowans, urging them to make it a strong night.\n\n“All the media pundits love to talk about how they know what’s going to happen in Iowa,” Haley told a crowd in Ankeny on Thursday. “You have to get tired of that, right?”\n\nHaley said she’s relying on caucusgoers to come to the right decision.\n\n“You’re still making up your minds, you’re still figuring out where you want to go,” she said. “But what I do know is I trust you. I trust that you did your homework. I trust that you know where you want the country to go.”\n\nDeSantis has said repeatedly that Trump is “running for his issues,” while DeSantis is “running for your issues and your family's issues.”\n\n“You're never going to have an election that is going to be as meaningful as this one is going to be,” DeSantis said Saturday in West Des Moines. “So take advantage of that. It's going to be cold. It's not going to be pleasant. But if you're willing to go out there and you're willing to fight for me ... then as president, I'll be fighting for you for the next eight years, every single day.”\n\nTexas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley held four events around Iowa over the weekend.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson made appearances in Des Moines and Ames, where he said Republicans have to make the case that the country needs to go in a different direction than Trump.\n\n“One person in America who really likes the poll numbers where they see Donald Trump 28 points ahead is Joe Biden,” Hutchinson said. “He's sitting there loving it because that's the one chance he has to win.”\n\nMore:Where the candidates stand on the issues\n\nWhat do Iowans think?\n\nNancy Wildanger said she and her husband have been attending events, including those held by Haley and DeSantis, for weeks as they prepared to pick a candidate to caucus for.\n\n“He was totally a Nikki. I was totally undecided,” she said. “Now I’m for Nikki.”\n\nWildanger, a resident of Iowa City, said she believes Haley is the best candidate in this year’s election.\n\n“I don’t think she backs down,” Wildanger said. “She’s also really smart. I just think she’ll have a better chance of winning over Trump.”\n\nKen and Bonnie May, of Slater, said that they're convinced that Hutchinson is the right choice to be the nominee. Ken said he will caucus for Hutchinson on Monday.\n\n“I think he's really authentic and down to earth. He's really intelligent. You can ask him anything, and he just seemed to answer honestly,\" Ken May said. “This to me is an opportunity to vote for somebody that I think could be really good.”\n\nLori Tiangco of Des Moines said she was drawn to DeSantis because of his “commitment to moving our country forward.”\n\n“He has followed through on everything he said he was going to do,” she said. “If he said it, he’s done it.”\n\nTiangco said she doesn’t care what the polls say. She believes DeSantis will do “amazing” on Monday night.\n\n“It’s going to be the people getting out, going to their caucus location and casting their votes that’s going to make the difference,” she said.\n\nHaley said Iowans have something to be excited about once the caucuses are over.\n\n“Just think, all the TV commercials will go away,” she said. “All the mail, all the text messages. I know you are ready to see this — all the media — I know you’re ready to see everybody go. But you get it. You get the fact that it all starts with you. You set the tone for the country. It’s a pretty cool thing when you think about the fact that you get to set the tone for where you want our country to go.”\n\nKatie Akin, Galen Bacharier, Virginia Barreda, Nixson Benítez, Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, David Jackson, Savannah Kuchar and Marina Pitofsky contributed to this story.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Maggie Hassan in November. In the state’s 1st Congressional District, there is a GOP primary where the nominee will challenge Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in a key House race this fall.\n\nIn addition to both parties selecting a nominee for governor in Rhode Island, the race to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin in the state’s 2nd Congressional District is on the ballot.\n\nWhile Delaware will not hold any primaries for Congress or governor, the state will hold local and some lower-profile statewide primaries.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know:\n\nIn New Hampshire, the highest-profile race will be the GOP primary for the US Senate seat. Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, is facing off with state Senate President Chuck Morse. Fearing that Bolduc could jeopardize their chances of unseating Hassan, some Republicans have been pouring money into the race to try to boost Morse. The winner will take on Hassan, who is seeking a second term.\n\nGranite State Republicans in the 1st District will also choose their nominee to face Rep. Chris Pappas, who is seeking a third term, in November. Top contenders in the crowded primary include: Matt Mowers, who worked as an adviser in the State Department in former President Donald Trump’s administration; Karoline Leavitt, who was an assistant press secretary in Trump’s administration; Gail Huff Brown, the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown; and state Rep. Tim Baxter.\n\nIn Rhode Island, there is a full slate of primaries, including in the state’s open 2nd Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin opened up a competitive Democratic primary for the seat when he announced his retirement in January. Rhode Island Treasurer Seth Magaziner has raised the most amount of money in the race but was unable to clear the field.\n\nMagaziner faces opposition from several Democrats, including Sarah Morgenthau, who was the director of the Peace Corps Response under former President Barack Obama; David Segal who once served in the state legislature and ran a failed congressional race in 2010; and Joy Fox, who worked as communications director for Langevin and former Gov. Gina Raimondo. The winner will face Republican Allan Fung, who is unopposed, in November.\n\nIn the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Gov. Dan McKee is seeking his first full term after being elevated from lieutenant governor last year after Gina Raimondo became President Joe Biden’s commerce secretary. McKee faces opposition from a few Democrats, including Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former CVS president Helena Foulkes. Businesswoman Ashley Kalus is the favorite to win in the Republican primary. The last time a Republican won the governorship was in 2002.\n\nHow to follow CNN’s election coverage\n\nYou can follow along with results on CNN.com and with our live updates.

Alex Michael Ramos, whose last known address was in Georgia, was also charged with malicious wounding.\n\nThe protests, in which dozens were injured, were sparked by the proposed removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general.\n\nPolice have been criticized by both sides for not intervening more, including when Preston allegedly discharged his weapon. In the ACLU's video, viewers observed officers in neon uniforms standing within yards — and possibly within earshot — of the gunshot, but they don't appear to respond.\n\nAt a meeting in the Cecil County Administration building in December 2013, Preston told the 50 people in attendance that the Ku Klux Klan doesn't have a problem with people of other colors. His group just wants to take back their country, he said.\n\n\"If we don't stop Barack Obama, if we don't stop this government all together that is running us into the ground, working us like dogs, so that they can keep taking it and giving it to somebody else, we're not going to have a country,\" said Preston.\n\nKalil Zaky, an African American, asked Preston at the meeting how the Klan was not considered a hate group based on its history.\n\nPreston said the Klan was not a hate group, adding others have labeled it as such. Preston did say there were things done during the Civil Rights era that were wrong, but they are no longer this group.\n\n\"We can only ask you to trust us,\" Preston told him. Zaky, who left before the nearly two-hour meeting ended, was not convinced.\n\nAccording to the footage captured by the ACLU of Virginia and shared via its Twitter account, Preston, sporting tactical gear, a gun and a bandanna, appears to yell, \"Hey, (N-word)!\", before shooting.\n\nHe now faces a charge of discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school, according to CNN, a felony that could lead to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn an interview with an Indiana television station two days after the Charlottesville rally, Preston blamed local government for the violence that broke out there.\n\n“They’re being told not to do their job by the mayor,” Preston said about the police at the rally. “That mayor is now responsible for everything that took place. Every person that was hurt. Every person that died. All of it.”\n\nPreston was being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center after his arrest in Maryland, the Baltimore Sun reported, following a fugitive warrant issued in Virginia.\n\nPreston apparently worked as a maintenance man at an all-girls school in Baltimore from 1996 to 2001, according to the Sun. On Sunday, the Bryn Mawr School issued a comment condemning Preston's alleged ties and actions as \"hatred\" and \"racism.\"\n\nThe ACLU handed its footage of the Charlottesville incident to the FBI on Aug. 17, distributing it to state and local authorities in the days later, the newspaper reported.\n\nAttempts by news organizations to reach Preston on Sunday proved unsuccessful.\n\nNews Journal reporters Esteban Parra and Christina Jedra and USA Today reporter Josh Hafner contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/24/previous-south-carolina-republican-primary-winners/72730853007/", "title": "Previous South Carolina Republican primary winners", "text": "While Trump overwhelmingly won South Carolina's Republican primary, here's a look at which Republican candidates have previously won the Palmetto State's primaries.\n\nMore:2024 Elections Voter Guide\n\n2020\n\nIn 2020, the Republican party canceled primaries and caucuses in four states, including South Carolina, to ward off challengers and consolidate support for Trump.\n\n2016\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump: 32.51% Florida Senator Marco Rubio: 22.48% Texas Senator Ted Cruz: 22.33%\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump ended up winning South Carolina in 2016, beating Florida Senator Marco Rubio by nearly 10 points.

And in many of those races, the Trump-ified candidate defeated an opponent who had backing from the more establishment wing of the party.\n\nTuesday’s results in New Hampshire are a good microcosm of this trend.\n\nDon Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, won the Senate primary over a field of candidates that included state Senate President Chuck Morse. Bolduc did not receive Trump’s endorsement, but he is an outspoken supporter of the former President’s election denialism and even floated the possibility of disbanding the FBI in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago search last month. Morse was considered a more pragmatic candidate who had the endorsement of New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. (Sununu had also said that Bolduc was “not a serious candidate.”)\n\nIn GOP Senate primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, a similar scenario played out. Candidates clambered – at times desperately – for Trump’s approval and voting coalition, often by adopting his false claims about the 2020 election. In each of those cases, Trump’s chosen candidate won the nomination.\n\n(Sidebar: CNN’s Daniel Dale found that more than half of the 35 Republican Senate nominees this year have expressed at least some skepticism about the 2020 election results.)\n\nGovernor’s races weren’t much different. In Arizona, Kari Lake, a high-profile election denier, rode a Trump endorsement – and an adoption of Trumpism writ large – to the GOP nomination. Ditto Doug Mastriano, who rose to prominence for his unswerving belief that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, in Pennsylvania. In Wisconsin, Tim Michels won the Republican primary with Trump’s backing, as did Tudor Dixon in Michigan. (Georgia was a notable exception here, with Gov. Brian Kemp fending off a Trump-backed primary challenger.)\n\nWhich is a remarkable thing. Why? Because Trump is a former president of the United States, someone who lost his bid for a second term. And not just that, but someone who was in office when Republicans lost their House and Senate majorities.\n\nThe story of Trump’s political life is marked by more defeats than victories. And yet, there is a credible case to be made that he is at least as powerful today – in terms of his influence over the GOP – as he was when he was in the White House.\n\nWhat does that mean going forward? That Trump would start a 2024 Republican presidential nomination fight as a very clear favorite – even as it remains a very open question as to whether he can appeal to voters outside of the GOP base.\n\nThe Point: The Republican Party is Donald Trump’s party. Any doubt of that fact was erased by the 2022 primary season.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}]}

There was singing from the Ausbund, a song book of religious songs, which was beautiful in its way, but very simple. I heard bits and pieces of modern music out in the world, at a store or a business or coming from a passing car. As kids we would sneak around and hear music outside and inside some places where we knew it would be playing, but I never listened to any music regularly until I left.\n\nWhat made you decide not to return?\n\nReading and music. I couldn't give either up. I got my GED and wound up going to college and studying, among other things, literature, and couldn't unlearn all that I did and close my eyes to it and go back and live Amish. There is nothing wrong with living Amish, I am not implying that by any stretch. It may sound like I am trying to say to live Amish is to live in ignorance. Far from it.\n\nHow did your family react?\n\nLuckily an older brother made the decision before me and kind of broke the ice, so I got off a lot easier than he did, but they weren't happy at first. A lot of guilt trips and hawing, but from a place of love. I still get it occasionally. I am sure they still aren't happy about it, but after this long, acceptance has set in.\n\nHave any of them been to your shows?\n\nMy older brother has, but not other family.\n\nHow difficult was transitioning from the Amish community to the outside world?\n\nIt was a gradual process for me; going out into the world and experiencing it while still living at home, then in an apartment. Moving to New York was a shock. I am not in the city, but I have been there a lot. The hardest part, though, is the lack of quiet ... the cacophony of phones and cars and machines and blips is hard to shut out sometimes. Missing my family was the only thing more difficult.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to pursue music?\n\nIt was during the first year of my Rumspringa when an English friend played Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles. He had them on vinyl — his father's copies, with the inserts and lyrics — and it wasn't until I held those albums and heard them and read the words that I realized music can mean so much. As much as I love playing music, I love listening to it even more.\n\nHow do you feel about the Amish-centric shows that are cropping up on TV?\n\nWe get asked about them non-stop; 'Is the Amish Mafia real?' My answer is usually, 'If a bunch of people were doing illegal stuff on TV, wouldn't the police come and arrest them?' There is a reason they digitize people's faces on \"Cops\"… I have seen about five minutes each of \"Breaking Amish\" and \"Amish Mafia\" and of course I don't know the people on that show so I can't say how or who they really are, but it seems to me like people acting the way they think people should act on TV, but in bonnets and suspenders.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Amish Outlaws\n\nWhere: Cross County Shopping Center, 8000 Mall Walk, Yonkers. 914-968-9570.

Smyrna head coach Danny Wandless was nervous. The Eagles still led two sets to one, but momentum flows like the breeze in volleyball.\n\nAnna Richardson, however, was unphased. Her calming effect in the huddle kept the team relaxed. They focused on having fun and turned in their most dominant set of the match to become state champions.\n\nDelaware has crowned a girls volleyball state champion every year since 1975. Smyrna is the first team from below the canal to win.\n\nFor that achievement, the Smyrna girls volleyball team has been named the team of the year by the Delaware Sportswriters and Broadcasters Association. They are the first volleyball team to earn the honor, which has been awarded every year since 1999. The Eagles will be honored at the annual DSBA banquet on Feb. 19 at Riverfront Events at the Hyatt Hotel on the Wilmington Riverfront.\n\nReflecting on the championship win two months later, Wandless credited the school district and the Smyrna community who rallied around the team. Local firehouses blew their horns as the Eagles left town for the University of Delaware's Bob Carpenter Center, the site of the tournament finals. Police escorted them the entire way. Inside the Carpenter Center, Smyrna had the largest and most vocal fan base of the semifinalist schools.\n\n\"Doing something that we had never done before, our community just surrounded us,\" Wandless said. \"We felt like we were not alone.\"\n\nIn 2022, Smyrna lost in the quarterfinals to eventual state champion Tower Hill in a 3-0 match Wandless felt was closer than the score indicated. With most of the team returning, the goal was to go at least one round further in the state tournament.\n\nEverything Smyrna did on the court started with Richardson, who entered the season as Delaware Online/The News Journal's no. 1 ranked player and ended it as the state coach's association Player of the Year and the Delaware Gatorade Player of the Year.\n\n\"That's a lot of weight to be on somebody's shoulders,\" Wandless said of the preseason ranking. \"Her talent and ability on the court was huge for us, but she also made people around her better. There's no letting down. She's focused. She's going to bring it every time.\"\n\nMaryPat Kwoka, Charter of Wilmington's head coach and a fixture in Delaware volleyball over the past three decades as the leader of several schools and programs, previously coached Richardson and most of the Smyrna rotation on Premier Volleyball club teams.\n\n\"She kept everything in control,\" Kwoka said of Richardson and her 20-kill state final performance. \"She took over the game.\"\n\nEliza Schneider, a second-team All-State selection as a junior at Red Lion Christian, transferred to Smyrna for her senior year, which gave Smyrna \"dual weapons\" and strong \"A and B\" lines, Wandless said. Senior Elise Carter joined Schneider and Richardson on the 2023 All-State teams. Opposing coaches also credited setter Abigayle Osborne and libero Carly Timblin.\n\nWhen Smyrna met Caesar Rodney in the state tournament semifinals, Delaware was assured of having its first-ever finalist from downstate. The sport has been traditionally dominated by northern New Castle County private schools. Saint Mark's and Ursuline had won 15 of the 22 state championships since the turn of the century. Only Tower Hill, Padua, Charter of Wilmington and Delaware Military Academy had broken their collective string of victories.\n\nAfter the match, Wandless and Caesar Rodney head coach Jake Bluhm, who earned the distinction of Coach of the Year from the coach's association, credited the growth of the game downstate to the increased number of out-of-season club team opportunities.\n\nThe group of Richardson, Schneider, Carter, Osborne and Timblin have played together throughout their childhoods.\n\n\"There's definitely been more competition and it's gotten harder, but so has our team — we've gotten better as the years have gone on,\" Richardson said after the Caesar Rodney match.\n\nWandless said he is honored Smyrna is the team that \"opened the door\" for downstate schools. He praised the comraderie between coaches across the state, saying their rarely shy from sharing tidbits on how to improve their programs.\n\nPremier Volleyball, the club Kwoka leads, has twice as many teams as it did a decade ago. The club instructs kindergarten-aged kids to high school seniors at a variety of skill levels. It's one of several programs that has experienced recent growth and has helped improve the level of competition across the state.\n\n\"It's grown the sport tremendously,\" Kwoka said.\n\nAdded Kwoka, \"I think it's well deserved. They've definitely blown everybody's mind. ... I think Smyrna is going to start to be known as a volleyball school.\"\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

Her mother, Cindy, and father, Ken, both University of Delaware graduates and long-time educators – Cindy in the Red Clay Consolidated School District and Ken in Colonial – attended.\n\nIn accepting the John J. Brady Delaware Athlete of the Year Award on his daughter’s behalf, Ken Falgowski read a message from Katelyn in which she said she was “beyond humbled” to be recognized and added, “There’s no place like home and there’s no better place than Delaware.”\n\nFalgowski grew up just across the state line in Landenberg but received some of her first field hockey instruction in Delaware, she recalled, as a second-grader from Cathy Jackson, the former Wilmington High coach. Older sisters Kerry, who also played at UNC, and Carly, who played at William & Mary, also helped paved the way, she said.\n\nOLYMPICS: Delawareans Falgowski, Van Sickle team up in Rio\n\nPHILLIES: Top prospect Crawford tries to make the grade\n\nKatelyn became quite the prodigy, getting on the U.S. under-20 team at age 14 and making her U.S. National Team debut on Aug. 28, 2005, just as her junior year at St. Mark’s was starting.\n\n“Wow, that’s crazy when you think about it,” Falgowski, now 28, said when that date was mentioned. “I’m very proud of the career I’ve been having and that I still am playing. Although the years and miles are adding up, the heart’s still in it. I think that’s a testament to my teammates and my coaches and the program, that the desire is still there.”\n\nFalgowski went on to star at the University of North Carolina, where she was national player of the year as a senior in 2011. She represented the United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the 2012 Games in London and again last summer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where a fifth-place finish was the United States’ best since 1996 in Atlanta.\n\nHer 234 career appearances for the U.S. National Team are tops among present players. Falgowski called 2016 “a whirlwind.” The U.S. won its first international field hockey medal in 20 years with a third-place finish at the Champions Trophy Tournament in England.\n\nRanked fifth in the world entering the Olympics, the U.S. opened the Summer Games by beating international powers Argentina 2-1 and Australia 2-1, then handled Japan 6-1 and India 3-0 to start pool play 4-0. Great Britain nipped the U.S. 2-1 in its final pool game, and then the U.S. lost 2-1 to Germany in the quarterfinals with Falgowski scoring the lone American goal.\n\nTower Hill grad and former UNC teammate Caitlin Van Sickle from Wilmington was also on the U.S. field hockey team in Brazil. It was her first Olympics.\n\n“It was an incredible year of personal growth in terms of what my teammates and I were able to accomplish,” said Falgowski, a midfielder who is a key part of both the offensive and defensive efforts for the U.S. “I think we created a family bond on and off the field that I haven’t had with past teams. It’s something we really took pride in.\n\n“We may have fallen short of our ultimate goal of getting on the podium but that journey along the way was so rewarding of just learning about myself and learning there’s always more to give and more to push, and enjoying it.”\n\nFalgowski is the fifth field hockey player to win the Brady Award, showing the sport’s popularity and the long history of success in the First State.\n\nThe others were A.I. du Pont graduate Jana Withrow in 1997, Tatnall’s Jackie Ciconte in 2005, Cape Henlopen’s Carrie Lingo in 2007 and Caesar Rodney Casey Howard’s in 2009. Withrow and Lingo, like Falgowski, starred at UNC, and Lingo was Falgowski’s 2008 Olympic teammate. Ciconte played at Maryland and Howard at Delaware.\n\nThe field hockey theme also carried over to the Team of Year, which went to the University of Delaware’s NCAA championship squad. The Blue Hens upset North Carolina 3-2 in the NCAA final at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, on Nov. 20.\n\nRanked eighth in the nation entering the tournament, Delaware also upset top-seeded Duke 3-2 in overtime in the quarterfinals and avenged a regular-season loss with another 3-2 decision over Princeton in the semifinals.\n\n“They are bigger names,” Delaware coach Rolf van de Kerkhof said of the teams Delaware upended. “I don’t think we have better players on the roster but we had the best team.”\n\nDelaware won its final 19 games to finish 23-2. The national championship was the 10th in UD athletic history, but the first in field hockey and just the second in NCAA Division I (1983 women’s lacrosse). Sophomore Greta Nauck won the Honda Sports Award for Field Hockey as national player of the year.\n\nSanford boys basketball coach Stan Waterman earned the Tubby Raymond Award as Delaware’s Coach of the Year after guiding the Warriors to the sixth state title in his 25 seasons at the helm last March. Waterman is a Howard High and University of Delaware grad who said receiving an award named after Raymond, the Blue Hens’ College Football Hall of Fame coach from 1966-2001, was especially gratifying.\n\n“I had a chance to see up close and personal the impact he had on the [players’] lives and what an outstanding coach he was. This is really special for me,” Waterman said.\n\nCaesar Rodney High junior Zoe Scott received the Buddy Hurlock Unsung Hero Award, given annually to an athlete who has overcome hardship and inspired teammates. Scott has returned to playing basketball for the Riders despite surgery last January to remove a tumor from her cervical spine that left her temporarily paralyzed and hospitalized for several months. Scott, also a former state champion high jumper in outdoor track, still has some stiffness in her hands and fingers.\n\n“It’s just a blessing to be back with my team,” said Scott, whose CR team is 19-1 heading into Friday’s Henlopen Conference title game against Laurel at Cape Henlopen.\n\nThe Herm Reitzes Award for community service went to Wilmington resident Charma Bell, program director for the LPGA Urban Youth Golf Program First Tee of Delaware, which annually introduces the sport to thousands of students.\n\n“She’s a great human being,” Earl Cooper, who came through that program and is now a golf pro at Wilmington Country Club, said while introducing Bell. “She has a heart of gold and will do anything for you. I wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for her hard work.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

DelDOT projects that will increase to 1,205 trucks per day by 2040, which equates to about 20 percent of the traffic on that road. Officials say that is higher than average for similar roads in Delaware.\n\nWinzenried, who lives on Park Avenue near the intersection of U.S. 9, says the project calls for widening the road to include 10-foot shoulders on each side in his neighborhood. He says that will take a good chunk of his front yard and create even more truck noise, which he can clearly hear already.\n\n\"DelDOT says I'll be compensated for the land it takes, but that does nothing for the value of my real estate,\" he said. \"I don't think Route 9 should be a truck route at all. DelDOT should be removing truck traffic from residential and putting it in rural areas and that wasn't even on the table.\"\n\nDuring a public workshop in 2016, DelDOT presented a number of options for a realignment project to improve traffic operations and safety of the U.S. 9 Truck Bypass from east of Georgetown to U.S. 113.\n\nAt a public workshop on Wednesday, engineers presented what they believe is the best plan for the relocation project.\n\nFor Barbara Betts, a Georgetown resident since 1984, the relocation project makes sense. Her main concern is the truck bypass has no shoulder on either side, nor does it have a place to ride bikes.\n\n\"It boggles my mind it is classified as a truck route,\" said Betts, who lives just on the outer edge of the planned project. \"That's always been a concern. It's too dangerous.\"\n\nDelDOT project manager John Caruano said the project is in the environmental assessment phase and will go right into a 30-day public comment phase before initial design takes place in spring 2018.\n\nConstruction on the Park Avenue Relocation project is set to begin in 2022 and will take two years to complete. The total cost estimate including construction, utility relocations, right-of-way and environmental mitigation is approximately $33.8 million, Caruano said.\n\nSussex County needs\n\nPark Avenue is just one of Sussex County's top transportation priorities. Late last month, communications director Chip Guy presented to the county council the \"Sussex County Priorities\" report, which outlines the county's top transportation projects.\n\nThe county's 2019-2024 Capital Transportation Program requests were then presented to DelDOT officials to help make future priority transportation decisions for the county.\n\nWith new commercial development occurring in the county’s industrial park, truck traffic along the Route 9 Truck Bypass will continue and increase in the years to come.\n\nCounty officials believe that beyond truck traffic, a project to realign and make other improvements along U.S. 9 would provide an opportunity for the state to enhance this route to improve safety for through-traffic and local motorists as well.\n\nIt could serve as the base of a future Georgetown bypass to accommodate through-traffic to and from the beaches, Sussex County officials said, as well as along the U.S. 113 corridor, which functions as a critical travel link for daily commuters.\n\nSussex County Administrator Todd Lawson believes the Park Avenue realignment project is important for the county because it will improve east-west movement and allow the airport to grow.\n\n\"This is a cart and horse discussion,\" he said. \"We can't extend the runway until the road is out of the way. From the county's perspective, the road will have to be moved.\"\n\nLawson believes Delaware Coastal Airport is a critical part of Southern Delaware’s transportation system, and the facility continues to provide \"lift\" to the local economy.\n\nThe airport records nearly 40,000 landings and takeoffs each year, and is a vital piece of the area's educational and economic base, according to the county. There are 20 employers and nearly 1,000 jobs at the adjacent Sussex County Industrial Park, with an annual payroll of more than $36 million.\n\nBACKGROUND:Georgetown airport rebrands image\n\nOther Sussex County priorities • Pedestrian and bicyclist safety along the SR 1 corridor in Sussex County’s beach communities, particularly between the Five Points intersection and Dewey Beach. • Five Points Intersection/U.S. 9 Realignment: Improvements are needed at the Five Points intersection to reduce accidents at this gateway to the resort area, which is often congested and confusing to motorists. Realignment of the U.S. 9 connection at Five Points could ease congestion and improve safety. • Intersection at Del. 16 near Milton (programmed in CTP for FY21): An overpass with exits at this intersection, similar to the design built at Del. 1/SR 30 near Milford, would improve safety by eliminating cross-traffic and the need for a traffic signal. • Improvements to Sussex County’s major north-south corridors, specifically U.S. 113, remain a significant transportation need.\n\nSussex officials believe planned airport improvements, notably the extension of the main runway from 5,500 feet to 6,000 feet, will help retain well-paying jobs at the airport and support economic growth in the community. An earlier 500-foot runway extension project began in August 2012 and was completed in late 2013.\n\nSussex County government plans various improvements totaling nearly $15 million from FY18 to FY22 at the airport and industrial park complex. The local share of costs (county and state) for the additional 500-foot runway extension will be approximately $12 million. This includes $6 million for the actual runway extension and an additional $6 million for the necessary realignment of Park Avenue.\n\nWhile Sussex County officials say the Park Avenue/U.S. 9 Truck Bypass east of Georgetown sits near the top of the county's list of critical projects, others might be equally pressing.\n\nThe FY18-FY23 Capital Transportation Program contains approximately $272 million in estimated state and federal funding for improvements to the county’s network of east-west routes. There is approximately $7 million in the budget for FY18 alone.\n\nProjects targeted for funding include preliminary engineering for Del. 24 improvements, continued improvements to the U.S. 9 corridor, construction of the North Millsboro Bypass, and construction of grade-separated intersections on Del. 16, Del. 18/404, and U.S. 9.\n\nThe report says substantially more funding will be needed in the years ahead, particularly for rights of way acquisitions, so improvements on other major east-west arteries can occur across the entire network.\n\nIf current travel patterns continue as predicted, increased and frequent congestion will further interfere with local residents’ mobility in many areas.\n\nCounty officials believe anticipating and funding necessary improvements such as these across the county’s entire network of east-west arteries will better meet the travel needs of local residents and visitors for decades to come.\n\nSussex County is Delaware’s largest county, with 938 square miles of land within its borders. Within that broad expanse is more than 37 percent of the state’s 6,281 miles of public roadway.\n\nThe most heavily traveled roadways are U.S. 13 and Del. 1 – each carrying more than 30,000 vehicles daily – followed by U.S. 113 with more than 24,000 vehicles daily.\n\nAt the same time, the major east-west routes also are heavily traveled, though these are less capable of extensive traffic. Congestion due to the movement of summer visitors often compounds traffic problems.\n\nDel. 24 is one of Sussex County’s primary east-west corridors. East-west routes are critical to allowing local motorists and destination drivers access to homes and commercial centers in the resort area.\n\nIn more recent years, these two-lane roads have been insufficient to safely and efficiently move traffic into and out of the area, particularly during peak summer months and evacuations.\n\n\"These roadways are antiquated and can't handle the current traffic,\" said Georgetown resident Donna Reynolds. \"Traffic flow into Five Points near Lewes is terrible.\"\n\nFive Points is located at the junction of U.S. 9, Del. 1, and Del. 404 about five miles west-northwest of Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Del. 404/18 corridor, which connects with U.S. 9 at Georgetown, is the principal means of east-west movement in Sussex County. This route, which connects to Route 404 in Maryland, is the gateway for beach-bound traffic during summer months, but a primary artery for local commuting traffic year-round.\n\nLawson says high traffic volume often limits this two-lane road’s capacity.\n\n\"Maryland is widening its portion of the route to accommodate east-west traffic to and from Delaware,\" he said. \"You can see the difference at the Delaware-Maryland border. That's going to be a problem. It will create a bottleneck for sure.\"\n\nOther Sussex County priorities\n\n• Pedestrian and bicyclist safety along the Del. 1 corridor in Sussex County’s beach communities, particularly between the Five Points intersection and Dewey Beach.\n\n• Five Points Intersection/U.S. 9 Realignment: Improvements are needed at the Five Points intersection to reduce accidents at this gateway to the resort area, which is often congested and confusing to motorists.

The correct years are between 2001 and 2016.\n\nNot long ago on a sunny Saturday afternoon, the lanes of Route 1 between Lewes and Rehoboth Beach were jammed with cars, trucks, motorcycles and recreational vehicles.\n\nIt was a typical scene on Sussex County’s busiest highway, the main access to the vacation destinations of Lewes, Bethany Beach and Fenwick Island — and most everything in between.\n\nBut there was a twist to this scenario. And it is one that raises concerns about Sussex County’s ability to absorb more jobs,tourists and residents without creating traffic nightmares and a boatload of inconvenience for all of the above.\n\nThat traffic congestion incident on the Coastal Highway occurred in January, just a few weeks after Christmas. It was further proof that the popularity of coastal Delaware is no longer a Memorial Day to Labor Day phenomenon.\n\n“I used to joke that, if I died after Labor Day, they wouldn’t find me until Easter,” said state Sen. Gerald Hocker, who owns several major businesses in the county. “But that is certainly no longer the case.”\n\nDelaware House Speaker Peter Schwartzkopf, a resident of Rehoboth Beach and retired state trooper, said: \"It used to be, on Labor Day at 5 o’clock, you could roll the streets up.\"\n\nThe change in seasonal differences has accompanied a phenomenal overall increase in Sussex County traffic that, in some cases, has doubled in volume in just five years.\n\n“There has been a tremendous amount of growth and a remarkable increase in the amount of traffic all year long,” said Jeff Stone, who was a frequent visitor to Sussex before moving to Milton 11 years ago.\n\n“After we moved here (in 2012), we discovered there is no longer such a thing as an offseason,” said Robert Billmyre, a Milton resident, who is part of a coalition opposing the proposed Overbrook Town Center development along Route 1, north of Lewes.\n\nGrowth:Delaware beaches transform into year-round destination\n\nGrowth:Delaware beaches have retained their small-town charm while growing\n\nGiven that the population in Sussex County is growing by more than 5,000 permanent residents annually, that employment will continue to increase and that tourism — now attracting about 4 million visitors annually — will continue an upward trend, the strain on Sussex County highways can only get worse.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2016, employment in Sussex grew by 15 percent, housing starts jumped by 80 percent and population grew by 12 percent.\n\n“The danger is, at some point, this growth will have an impact on our quality of life,” said Stone, who also has been fighting the proposed Overbrook development, which, if built, would significantly increase traffic in the area.\n\nStory continues after video.\n\nAn analysis of data obtained from the Delaware Department of Transportation through the Freedom of Information Act shows some staggering increases in traffic volume on many key roads in Sussex in a relatively short period of time.\n\nSome of the highlights between 2001 and 2016:\n\n•Route 16, a two-lane east-west highway, saw an 82 percent increase in traffic. On average, 6,330 vehicles per day use that road, which runs through Milton to Route 1.\n\n•Route 24 between Millsboro and Route 1 had a 70 percent increase, with an average of 19,308 vehicles daily.\n\n“Right now, the biggest traffic jam in all of Sussex County is Route 24,” Hocker said. DelDOT has announced plans to widen one section of Route 24 near Love Creek by 2020.\n\n•Route 9 at the infamous Five Points had a 24 percent increase while the same two-lane road had a 63 percent increase west of Georgetown, where it crosses Route 113.\n\n•Route 113, another favorite of vacationers traveling north and south, had an astounding 112 percent increase. The four-lane road carried 38,505 vehicles daily.\n\nStory continues after graphic.\n\nBut the changes in volume are not the only issues of concern.\n\nIndeed, what used to be a short-term increase in traffic during the tourist season has evolved into something of a much longer duration.\n\n“It has been continually going up,” said Carol Everhart, president of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce. “It used to be seasonal but now it has extended to 52 weeks a year.”\n\nDelDOT statistics bolster the argument.\n\n•On Route 113 between Routes 9 and 404, February traffic in 2010 averaged 13,034 vehicles per day in 2010 but that volume increased 101 percent to 26,163 in 2016.\n\nBy contrast, the July 2016 daily volume was 19 percent higher — 31,184 vehicles.\n\n•Route 113 traffic in February 2016 was 26,163, marginally lower than the summertime peak of 31,184 vehicles. In 2010, the differences were markedly different — 13,034 vehicles in February, 32,723 in July.\n\nFinding a fix\n\nWhile many agree that the traffic situation has gotten worse in the past decade, there is disagreement about the solutions — or why county and state governments have failed to finance highway improvements that might reduce the inconvenience for residents and visitors alike.\n\nSome suggest that Delaware is much more conservative about funding infrastructure improvements, contrasting to border states like Maryland.\n\nSaid a DelDOT report in 1998: “We can’t build our way out of congestion.”\n\n“DelDOT has been cautious and rightly so,” said I.G. Burton, a current member of the Sussex County Council and a lifelong Delaware resident.\n\nMaryland, for example, spent millions of dollars to widen Route 404 to four lanes between Route 50 and the Delaware line.\n\nNow beachgoers can enjoy the four-lane highway from the Bay Bridge — until they hit a two-lane bottleneck when they cross into Delaware.\n\nMore:Boutiques are hot shopping spots at Maryland, Delaware beaches\n\nIn fact, with the exception of one stretch where 404 crosses Route 13 in Bridgeville, the road is two choked traffic lanes from the state line east to Lewes — with no immediate plans for significant improvements.\n\n“I guess I don’t understand why that is not on our radar,” said Hocker, the state senator.\n\n“As growth has occurred, the resources haven’t kept pace with the needs in Delaware,” said Ruth Briggs King, a state representative from Georgetown.\n\nOthers suggest that DelDOT is more inclined to spend money on the state’s north-south corridors. Much of their attention has focused on modest improvements like traffic signal coordination, improved pedestrian safety and, in Lewes, a place to park along Route 1 and take a bus to the beach.\n\n“DelDOT does not do a lot for east-west traffic,” said Billmyre, the Milton resident.\n\nFor its part, DelDOT is very methodical about assessing needs and establishing funding priorities. The agency’s last statewide transportation plan was adopted in 2010.\n\nMore DelDOT:Five Points traffic nightmare: Officials search for a fix\n\nMore DelDOT:TIGER grant moves intersection up on Sussex County projects list\n\nMany also feel that Sussex bears the brunt of a New Castle County bias that exists in the state legislature, where the transportation budget is crafted.\n\nIn the 2010 DelDOT planning document, for example, there are 43 highway construction projects listed for New Castle County, 19 for Kent and five for Sussex.\n\n“Sussex has not been a DelDOT priority for 25 years,” said Kim Hoey Stevenson, a member of the county planning and zoning commission. Stevenson is an occasional freelancer for Delmarva Now.\n\n“Upstate does tend to get more attention but the south is where the growth is right now,” said Everhart of the Rehoboth-Dewey Chamber of Commerce.\n\nState legislator Briggs King said: “We have been struggling because we just have not gotten the resources we need.”\n\nThe primary reason, she said, “We just don’t have the representation they have in New Castle.”\n\n“I would agree with that,” said Schwartzkopf.\n\nHocker thinks the funding is because of a disconnect with Sussex and DelDOT, but optimistically said the situation is slowly changing as Sussex gains population — and representation in the state legislature.\n\n“We are gaining every year,” he said.\n\nAdded Schwartzkopf: “Per capita, we are much better off than we used to be.”\n\nDelDOT said Secretary Jennifer Cohan was traveling and not available to discuss funding priorities or the department’s relationship with Sussex County.\n\nJoshua Thomas, DelDOT planning supervisor was offered as an alternative but he said had only been on the just for two years and could not comment on past funding decisions.\n\n“Besides, we can’t change what happened yesterday,” he said.\n\nHousing desire adds to population\n\nOthers also fault fast growing Sussex County for approving development after development with little apparent concern about the impact of those projects on the community.\n\nCritics also say, the assumption has been, DelDOT and not Sussex County is responsible for improving roads to handle the additional development-related traffic.\n\n“For years and years, the County Council has ignored traffic growth as it pertains to development,” said Hocker.\n\nBut Stevenson, a current member of the planning and zoning commission, and Burton a former member now serving on the County Council, said they are now more cautious about approving new development projects.\n\nDelDOT agreed that Sussex County has gotten better about discussing new developments and the potential impact on congestion.\n\n“We are committed to improving our relationship with the county,” Thomas said.\n\nMore housing:Live where you work, unless at the beach. Affordable housing slim at resorts\n\nMore:Opinion: How the beach economy is making life harder for low-income Sussex residents\n\nIn fact, Sussex County recently released a comprehensive transportation plan for the future with this dire warning: “Today, demand is exceeding capacity in several areas, causing traffic congestion. Mobility will only worsen if solutions are not implemented to deal with increasing traffic demand.”\n\nBut some elected officials say that Delaware residents should share some of the blame because several major highway projects were scuttled because of public opposition to the loss of farmland — the county’s economic backbone.\n\n“Locals just didn’t want to disrupt agriculture,” said Briggs King.\n\nSchwartzkopf agreed. “Sometimes we are our own worst enemy when it comes to fixing roads,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, though many Sussex County businesses are benefiting from the increased influx of visitors and full-time residents, others are worried that traffic congestion is going to eventually scare people away.\n\nBut Briggs King thinks the growth, once managed, will be a benefit to a robust and bustling Sussex County economy.\n\n“It’s a good problem to deal with,” she said.\n\nraetyson@gmail.com\n\nTraffic by the numbers\n\nBetween 2001 and 2016\n\n•Route 16, a two-lane east-west highway, saw an 82 percent increase in traffic. On average, 6,330 vehicles per day use that road, which runs through Milton to Route 1.\n\n•Route 1, a four-lane highway that often backs up during peak vacation times, registered an increase of 58 percent in both directions north of Route 16, carrying an average of 32,871 vehicles daily.\n\n•Route 24 between Millsboro and Route 1 had a 70 percent increase, with an average of 19,308 vehicles daily.\n\n•Route 9 at the infamous Five Points had a 24 percent increase while the same two-lane road had a 63 percent increase west of Georgetown, where it crosses Route 113.\n\n•Route 404 west of 113 — a favorite of beach-going tourists — had an increase of 45 percent, carrying an average of 29,819 vehicles daily.\n\n•Route 113, another favorite of vacationers traveling north and south, had an astounding 112 percent increase. The four-lane road carried 38,505 vehicles daily.\n\n•Route 26, Garfield Parkway, declined by 17 percent, possibly because construction activities.\n\n•Route 54, a busy east-west highway in the southern part of the county that runs through Selbyville, saw a modest increase from 6,269 vehicles daily to 6,869 from 2010 to 2016. Locals often complain about traffic on the route and DelDOT could not explain the discrepancy between residents’ perceptions and their own data.\n\nWinter is growing\n\n•On Route 113 between routes 9 and 404, February traffic in 2010 averaged 13,034 vehicles per day in 2010 but that volume increased 101 percent to 26,163 in 2016.\n\n•By contrast, the July 2016 daily volume was just 19 percent higher — 31,184 vehicles.\n\n•Route 113 traffic in February 2016 was 26,163, marginally lower than the summertime peak of 31,184 vehicles.

It last changed hands for $7.5 million in 2004, according to Realtor.com.\n\nNamed \"Sandaway,\" the former property of Alexis F. du Pont Sr. actually includes two homes, a 7,035-square-foot main home on a 26,692-square-foot lot and a 2,922-square-foot guest house on a 7,906-square-foot lot.\n\nThe sale closed April 26 after being on the market since March 28, 2019, according to listing agent Kim Hamer, a Realtor at Ocean Atlantic Sotheby's International Realty.\n\n“At that point that was the highest residential sale in Delaware that was recorded in our MLS system, so that does not include any private sales,” Hamer said.\n\nBuilt in 1939 with renovations through the years, the main home features seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, six fireplaces, a curved staircase, wrap-around decks, a sunroom, a gourmet kitchen with Wolf appliances and granite counters, a great room, a living room, a formal dining room, den, sauna, basement and outdoor shower.\n\nHamer said almost every room has unobstructed ocean views.\n\nThe guest house has five bedrooms, four baths, a kitchen that opens to the dining room and great room, a large screened porch, patio and outdoor shower.\n\nThe property includes parking for 10 to 15 cars.\n\nMORE DELAWARE DREAM HOMES:Most expensive listings in Greenville area\n\nHamer said the buyers and sellers wish to remain anonymous. She wouldn’t comment on the new owners’ plans for the property.\n\nMore family-friendly town\n\nDewey Beach Commissioner Paul Bauer said the sale represents not only the rise in property values but a change in the perception of the town, which for years had more of a “party town” reputation compared with Rehoboth or Bethany.\n\n“We are extremely happy about the record-setting home sale here in Dewey Beach,” Bauer said. “This transaction speaks volumes to the commitment to positive changes our community has undergone and the exceptional demand for Dewey Beach properties.”\n\nAssistant Town Manager Jim Dedes agreed that Dewey Beach has become much more family-friendly over the years.\n\n“We’re seeing more people choosing to retire here or have a second home here. We’re getting more families, more people moving here to live year-round. We’re very pleased with what’s happening,” Dedes said.\n\nThe rising property values have been good news for sellers, while buyers have been snatching up homes along the narrow strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Rehoboth Bay.\n\n“The people who are selling are very happy,” said Dedes. “Home values have definitely escalated. Most lots are roughly 5,000 square feet, and we’ve been noticing people buying a home for over a million dollars, then tearing down the home and building new.”\n\nPlans to demolish homes\n\nThe stately homes at Sandaway won't be around for long either.\n\nDedes said the new owners of the property at 1 and 3 Cullen St. plan to demolish the homes, which date back about 82 years.\n\nHe said the sellers sold to three buyers.\n\n“We’ve met with two of them. We haven’t met with the third, but we talked with their architect, engineer and attorney,” Dedes said. “Apparently, they are going to tear down the homes. They want to build three.”\n\nThe town hasn’t received an application for the demolition yet.\n\nMORE DEWEY BEACH NEWS:Will they stay or go? Residents take fight over oceanfront 5G poles to court\n\nDedes said before this sale, the town had already agreed to a subdivision on the 34,598-square-foot property that is almost eight-tenths of an acre.\n\n“That goes way back to the former property owner. It’s two lots,” Dedes said.\n\nThe new owners want to divide the entire property into three lots, he said.\n\nThe minimum lot size in Dewey Beach is 5,000 square feet, just under an eighth of an acre.\n\nReporter Ben Mace writes about real estate and development.

Located at 900 Old Kennett Road in Centreville, it is currently listed for $4.995 million, instead of the original asking price of $5.5 million.\n\n\"We have a very limited target audience,\" said listing agent Stephen Mottola, who has been pulling out all the stops to get the mansion sold.\n\nThat means sending personal brochures to agents in cities like New York, D.C. and Philadelphia, as well as holding wine-and-cheese receptions meant to entice buyers who like to entertain.\n\nMottola said he's not just selling a house, he's selling a lifestyle. He also thinks the estate is well-priced, at about $238 per square foot.\n\n“It’s an unbelievable value for what it is,\" Mottola said. \"It would literally cost you more to build the house then they’re asking for it.”\n\nIn general, luxury homes are taking longer to sell these days, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nIn 2018, 62% of the most expensive properties in the U.S. were on the market for longer than 180 days, according to a report from Concierge Markets.\n\nEven when they did sell, 38% went for just 89.95% of the original list price, which is a substantial difference when you're talking about houses priced in the millions.\n\nStonehouse, though the most expensive home currently listed in the Wilmington area, is not the only one languishing on the market.\n\nOLD MONEY: Historic Rehoboth Beach house, with du Pont ties, listed for $14.9M\n\nA $2.6 million house on Centre Court, not far from Buckley's Tavern in Centreville, has been on the market for 431 days and the price has been lowered twice. A Kennett Pike house built in 1703 and listed for $2.2 million has been on the market more than a year and the price has been lowered twice.\n\nStonehouse, which was first listed for sale in 2016, was briefly taken off the market in December 2018, according to Zillow. The price was dropped by about 9% in April 2019.\n\nMottola said it was temporarily delisted because the owners were entertaining.\n\nThe house belongs to Richard and Sharon Struthers. Richard Struthers was an MBNA executive before it was acquired by Bank of America. He then served as president of Bank of America Global Card Services and was a member of the bank’s executive management team.\n\n'Pure character'\n\nMottola has described Stonehouse as a decadent \"mini-resort.\"\n\n“I think the most distinctive feature is just the pure character,\" he said.\n\nThe main house features 21,000 square feet of living space with an English conservatory, two-story copper bay windows and wrought-iron balconies.\n\nConstruction started in 1936 and was completed in 1939.\n\nThe house was built for Crawford H. \"Greenie\" Greenewalt and his wife, Margaretta Lammot du Pont. Greenewalt, a chemical engineer, served as DuPont Co.'s president from 1948 to 1962. During World War II, he also was a manager of the Manhattan Project for the company.\n\nA noted ornithologist, his area of focus was hummingbirds. Meanwhile, Gret, as she was known, was an avid gardener.\n\nStonehouse, as its name implies, features stones from foundation to roof. Inside, every floor and stair is built upon concrete. As the home is constructed, a blaze cannot spread beyond a room, and bedroom balconies offer an escape.\n\n“He was always scared of fire,” Mottola said of Greenewalt.\n\nThe property initially comprised 550 acres, most of which was donated to the Delaware Nature Society to be conserved in perpetuity. Currently, the property sits on slightly more than 22 acres.\n\nLeading to the home is a private lane lined by mature oaks selected by Gret du Pont. The grounds were designed by landscape architect Thomas W. Sears, known for his work on the Mt. Cuba Center.\n\nMature conifers and flowering trees conceal the residence until the dramatic unveiling in the circular drive.\n\nThe two-story entrance hall features a turned staircase with a window seat, cove ceiling, wainscoting and walnut parquet floors. Designed for entertaining, the east wing includes a refined drawing room with French doors to the terrace. Pocket doors lead to the living room, where imported Italian marble surrounds the gas fireplace.\n\nThe dining room is distinguished by hardwood floors set in a herringbone pattern and a graduated façade around the gas fireplace.\n\nA chef’s kitchen is made for entertaining, with an outsized center island that doubles as dining space. There’s also a butler’s pantry, wet bar and wine storage.\n\nThe lower level of the home offers an English-style pub with pieces imported from Manchester, England; a cinema and gaming rooms.\n\nUpstairs, the five primary bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, are richly appointed with unique architectural details.\n\nIn the master suite, walls are covered with silk moiré, and there’s a Juliet balcony, on which Greenewalt once photographed birds. Modern updates include a travertine and marble bathroom with a claw-foot tub, a two-person shower and dual vanities.\n\nOutdoors, a pool house with a fully equipped entertainment area accompanies an infinity pool, complete with a water slide built into the landscape.\n\nThe current owners made their own mark on the place while preserving many original gems, Mottola has said.\n\nAmong them is the fireplace in the luxurious master suite. Its wood mantel was carved by Irene Sophie du Pont, a great-granddaughter of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours, founder of the DuPont Co.\n\nShe was Gret's mother, according to the listing.\n\nIn the meantime, an old screened porch has been transformed into an English conservatory with a marble mosaic floor and sensors that monitor and adjust the greenhouse's panels.\n\nAbove the six-stall detached garage, there is a guest home with full kitchen, great room, two bedrooms, a full bath and some of the best views of the property from the private deck.\n\nThe property is also home to a caretakers cottage with three bedrooms and a four-car garage.\n\nSuzanne Herel contributed reporting.

We have an event for everyone. We have great 5K run-walks like the Turkey Trot and we have the Main Street Mile.”\n\nEasy access to fitness trails is another attraction.\n\n“People come to Newark to walk and bike those trails,” Clifton said. “I have a neighbor who’s originally from Jersey City and his kids went to the University of Delaware. When he visited them, he stayed at a hotel in Newark. He found out about the trails and he said he really enjoyed them.”\n\nNow he’s moved to Newark and those trails were one of the reasons, Clifton said.\n\nRealtor Kelly Ralsten agreed that new residents are attracted by the university and the city’s amenities as well as recreational opportunities.\n\n“Buyers are drawn to the downtown feel and what is offered at the university. It still has a small-town community feel,” said Ralsten, who has more than 27 years of experience in real estate including the last 23 with Patterson Schwartz.\n\nBut she said they also love the wide open spaces outside the city.\n\n“These are old farming areas with rolling hills.

He and his wife, Terry, are co-owners of their family’s real estate business which was established in 1966.\n\n“Kent County, in general, has better real estate values than New Castle to the north,” Burns said. “Middletown, for example, is pricier. Your better values remain consistent as you go south where they pick up again near Milton as you get closer to the beach.”\n\nThe average home sales price in Dover’s 19904 ZIP code, basically west of Route 13, was $258,789 in June, according to real estate website Zillow. That compares to $396,185 in Milton and $416,752 in Middletown.\n\nAttractions in the capital city include shopping centers, restaurants, schools, museums and entertainment, yet without a big-city feel.\n\n“Dover maintains its somewhat small-town atmosphere with The Green, the Capital complex and a vibrant downtown that is very walkable from some of the residential communities,” Burns said. “We boast a very sophisticated health care system with both campuses of Bayhealth. We are extremely high tech with the Dover Air Base and extremely low tech with our very bustling and friendly Amish community.”\n\nHe cited ease of transportation with Routes 1 and 13.\n\n“The beaches and outlet centers are less than an hour to the south, and all of the metro areas on the Northeast corridor are to the north with easy access,” Burns said.\n\nSo, if you’re sold on Dover, check out the top 10 “dream homes” for sale including one for over $1 million.

And the young woman holding her ground.''\n\nThe woman paid $4, took it home and hung it on her wall. Eventually, she moved it to her closet.\n\nIn September, that painting was auctioned off for $191,000, making international art news as it turned out to be a long-lost N.C. Wyeth painting called \"Ramona.''\n\nMatt Weiner is general manager of the three family-owned Zelky's Beach Arcades. One arcade on the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk is only a few steps away from the legendary Thrasher's french fries stand, a favorite stop for visitors that does not serve ketchup. Instead, fries are served with salt and apple cider vinegar, as they always have been.\n\nThe result is a lot of ketchup-loving fries fans asking for or even stealing ketchup from other nearby businesses.\n\nThis spring, Weiner \"came up with a creative, buzz-worthy, and slightly profitable way to possibly halt ketchup begging and pilfering,'' reports Patricia Talorico\n\nOn Memorial Day weekend, a claw-style arcade game usually filled with toy rubber ducks was filled with single-serve packets of Heinz ketchup to help address the ketchup cravings of boardwalk fry nibblers — and inspire more than a few smiles.\n\nThere's nothing like social media to catapult a furry creature to celeb status.\n\nWhen Middletown's Jeff Permar first spotted Chunk the Groundhog in his backyard, he saw red, writes Ryan Cormier.\n\n\"Once Permar caught the garden-eating woodchuck on a motion sensor camera, he showed the footage to his friend Rick Arzt, lead singer of the Dewey Beach-based rock band Love Seed Mama Jump,\" Cormier reports.\n\n\"Arzt saw a furry star.''\n\nWhile he may have potential to wreak havoc in the garden and inspire some headaches for the farmer, Chunk has also gone viral as a rising star on Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok.\n\nFor an A-list star who seems to carry a magic wand as she makes bold career moves, it did seem like an odd choice.\n\nAs more and more people ditch dairy in favor of plant-based milk and other products, Delaware native Aubrey Plaza became a campaign spokesperson for a fake product called Wood Milk meant to poke fun at substances that don't come from mammals being labeled as \"milk.''\n\nWhile the U.S. Department of Agriculture-approved video ads that featured Plaza in lumberjack mode were funny, not everyone was laughing. Plaza faced some pushback from vegans and climate change activists, as well as a complaint to the USDA Office of Inspector General by the nonprofit Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.\n\nAccording to the complaint, MilkPEP campaign launched a \"viral advertising campaign disparaging plant-based milks, in violation of laws forbidding federal agricultural promotions from depicting products in a negative light.\"\n\nAs Andre Lamar wrote at the time, the viral ad definitely left a sour taste in some people's mouths.\n\nPlenty of Delaware attics harbor a secret or two. But not quite like this one ...\n\nAs Matthew Korfhage reports, one Newark attic held the secret to a historic museum burglary spree — and a million-dollar gun.\n\nA man named Michael Kintner Corbett kept priceless American history locked away from the world in a mouse-infested crawl space.\n\n\"On May 24, 2017, FBI agents led by art crimes Special Agent Jake Archer followed a search warrant into the hidden upper room of Corbett’s Newark residence and to a safe tucked in the basement,'' Korfhage writes. \"In the process, the agents broke open a 50-year mystery spanning six states, 16 museums and dozens of historic firearms whose provenance spans the entire history of America — a rash of museum burglaries Archer calls 'one of the largest of its kind that we’re aware of.'\n\nYou might expect, if you signed up for a few hours of volunteering, that you could come home with a free T-shirt or water bottle as a thank you. But a joint?\n\n\"When it came time to present the pot, grant the ganja or bestow the bud ― however you want to say it ― the organizers of Delaware's first 'Joints for Junk' decided to hand out the promised pre-rolls at the start of the two-hour trash clean up in Millsboro this fall,'' writes Ryan Cormier.\n\nWhile the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network has been organizing community events ever since its founding in 2013, this was the first time it was doing one since marijuana was legalized in Delaware eight months ago, he reports.\n\n\"So the nonprofit advocacy group brainstormed a new way to attract volunteers: give out grass. And they didn't even wait until the volunteers put in the work first.''\n\nTurns out, everyone stuck around and the event was a success, with more likely in the future.\n\nYou might expect an award-winning country star defending against multiple sexual assault allegations to go underground, or at least keep a low profile.\n\nWhat many didn't see coming is the country artist headlining his own comedy show.\n\nAs Andre Lamar reported earlier this year, Allen set out to \"tackle an entirely new corner of the entertainment industry by launching a comedy tour this fall titled ''I Said What I Said.' ''\n\nThe Milton Theatre shared photos on Facebook on Aug. 25 that featured Allen on stage doing a surprise comedy show at the venue. Allen was spotted wearing a hoodie at the show that read \"CANCEL Cancel Culture,\" Lamar reports.\n\nAllen's comedy stint came after two women filed lawsuits against him in May and June, respectively, for sexual assault. The second lawsuit resulted in him getting dropped from his record label BRB Music Group.\n\nThe Milton native filed countersuits in July in Tennessee against the women making the charges, according to USA TODAY, Billboard and People.\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed against the country star, who has been releasing new material via social media.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that anyone tasked with marketing something would daydream about attaching the name Taylor Swift to it in 2023.\n\nBut what we didn't see coming was an economics class at the University of Delaware inspired by the pop icon's phenomenal success.\n\nAs Kelly Powers reports, Swift was ubiquitous this year.\n\n\"The popstar was selected as Time magazine’s Person of the Year. Her record-breaking tour has grossed more than $1 billion, per AP, while she remains the top-played artist globally on Spotify. Oh, and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives also just recognized 2023 as the 'Taylor Swift Era' in her home state, via resolution, on her birthday,'' Powers writes.\n\nSeeing an opportunity, \"Delaware's largest university hopes to spur 'the future generation's interest in economics' with a voluntary course centering on the singer's economic impact.

We feel very lucky that we're now able to make that happen and are looking forward to spending time with our family in the place that matters most to us in the world,” Biden wrote in a statement that year.\n\nThe couple purchased the vacation home after the former vice president left office, the same year their income jumped nearly $10 million from speaking fees and book deals.\n\nZillow estimates the home is now worth more than $1.9 million.\n\nDuPont mansion\n\nBiden bought the five-bedroom, 2.5-bath former DuPont mansion at 6 Montchan Drive, Wilmington, Delaware, in 1974. He nicknamed the home “The Station” and used it as campaign headquarters during his 1988 election run.\n\nHe bought the 10,012-square-foot home in disrepair for $185,000. He spent two decades renovating and living in it before selling it for $1.2 million in February 1996.

He built a home on the secluded lakefront property in Greenville, an affluent neighborhood.\n\nZillow estimates the Biden’s nearly 7,000-square-foot home may be worth nearly $2.9 million.\n\nMcLean rental\n\nAfter leaving office, Biden began renting a large Georgian-style home in McLean, Virginia, not far from D.C. The Washington Post reports former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who served under President Ronald Reagan, once owned the home in the upscale neighborhood.\n\nZillow estimates renting the five-bedroom, nine-bathroom, 11,943-square-foot home costs $19,795 per month. According to Zillow, the home is worth nearly $5 million. The Bidens never owned it.\n\nMore:Fact check: In 1973, Biden said 'the two-party system' was 'good for the negro'\n\nAs of February, the Biden’s were no longer renting the McLean home.\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nWe rate the claim that Joe Biden owns four homes worth $3-7.5 million FALSE because it is not supported by our research.
