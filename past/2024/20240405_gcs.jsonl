Shortly before he turned 80 on Sunday, “the president stayed late to mingle with the guests”, the paper said.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, “the Biden family is taking care of the costs of the wedding”. The first lady’s communications director told The New York Times that it was “consistent with other private events hosted by the first family”, while the president’s press secretary said the event was “not White House business”.\n\nThe Biden marriage is not the first wedding to take place at the White House, and is in fact the 19th ceremony on the grounds. The last was in 2013 when President Barack Obama hosted a wedding for his photographer, Pete Souza. The last presidential family wedding to take place at the White House was back in the Clinton era, when Hillary Clinton’s youngest brother Anthony Rodham was married in the Rose Garden in 1994. President George W. Bush’s daughter Jenna Bush did hold her reception at the White House, but the wedding was held at the family’s ranch in Texas.\n\nFamily members of presidents Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson and Theodore Roosevelt were all married at the White House, while Woodrow Wilson saw no fewer than three family members tie the knot there. The first White House wedding took place in 1812 when President James Madison’s sister-in-law was married, while Grover Cleveland is the only president to have married there, doing so in 1886.\n\nHere are some of the most notable White House weddings in history.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/white-house-reaction-breyer-retirement/index.html", "title": "Biden and Breyer to hold event at White House on Thursday, source ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer are scheduled to appear together at the White House on Thursday as the 83-year-old justice is set to announce his retirement, a source familiar with the plan tells CNN.\n\nBreyer conveyed to the White House last week that he planned to step down from the court, but he did not tell Biden directly. As of Tuesday, the White House had yet to formally receive a letter from Breyer making his intentions official, the source said.\n\nA time and location for Thursday’s event have not been announced.\n\nAfter news broke on Wednesday of Breyer’s intentions to step down, the White House said Biden remains committed to nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe prospect of the historic Supreme Court nomination takes place at a crucial political moment for the Biden White House. With the 2022 midterm elections on the horizon and a myriad of policy battles playing out in Washington, the confirmation of a liberal justice could be the major win Democrats need to fire up their base this November.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during a news briefing on Wednesday that Biden “has stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court and certainly stands by that.” But she had no additional details or statements about the news of Breyer’s retirement.\n\nBreyer will be leaving the high court after two decades on the bench, and Biden’s pick to replace him is expected be a younger, fellow liberal who could serve on the court for decades. It’ll be the President’s first chance to nominate someone to the high court.\n\nWhile confirmation timelines vary, Democrats have signaled thus far that a prospective Supreme Court justice’s confirmation process would take place swiftly if Biden put forward a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday vowed that a Biden nominee will be confirmed with “all deliberate speed.”\n\nThe confirmation of justices typically takes months. But during the last Supreme Court vacancy, Republicans, as they were barreling toward the 2020 election, pushed through Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination in less than a month.\n\nDespite confirmation delays over the course of Biden’s first year in office, Senate Democrats are confident that a Supreme Court nominee will receive enough votes to get confirmed, according to senior Democratic sources.\n\nThe President also declined to weigh in on the news of Breyer’s retirement from the court on Wednesday, deferring to Breyer, personally, for any news.\n\n“Every justice has the right to decide what he or she is going to do, and announce that on their own,” Biden said. “There’s been no announcement from Justice Breyer. Let him make whatever statement he is going to make, and I’ll be happy to talk about it later.”\n\nBiden had said throughout his 2020 presidential campaign that he was committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court if elected.\n\n“I (have) committed that, if I’m elected as president and have the opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I’ll appoint the first Black woman to the court. It’s required that they have representation now — it’s long overdue,” Biden said in March 2020.\n\nA short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer’s retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel’s Office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy.\n\nNames on the list include: DC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, South Carolina US District Judge J. Michelle Childs, North Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, Minnesota US District Judge Wilhelmina “Mimi” Wright, Circuit Judge Eunice Lee, Circuit Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi and Sherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights attorney who recently announced plans to step down from her role as president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nOn Wednesday, Psaki declined to comment on rumors that Vice President Kamala Harris could be considered for a Supreme Court vacancy. However, she reiterated that the President has every intention on “running for reelection with Vice President Harris on the ticket as his partner.”\n\nThe prospective nomination of a Black woman to the high court is also a chance for Biden to make amends to progressives for his previous handling of Supreme Court nominations while serving in the Senate.\n\nAs a senator, Biden presided over six Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Robert Bork’s failed nomination. Biden was the senator in charge of shepherding Breyer’s nomination process as well.\n\nMost notable, however, was Biden’s role presiding over the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas when the then-Delaware senator was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearings for Thomas’ nomination included Anita Hill’s testimony alleging that Thomas, who was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had sexually harassed her.\n\nIn 2019, as Biden was preparing for a presidential run, he said he regretted that he didn’t give Hill, a Black woman, the “hearing she deserved.”\n\nHe said that hearing would have been one “where she was respected, where the tone of the questioning was not hostile and insulting.” Instead, he said, “she paid a terrible price – she was abused through the hearing, she was taken advantage of, her reputation was attacked.”\n\nBiden also acknowledged the racial dynamics at play, saying there was a “real and perceived problem the committee faced: There were a bunch of white guys” on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Hill’s testimony.\n\nAs a result of that dynamic, he said, “She faced a committee that didn’t fully understand what the hell it was all about.”\n\nLater that year, Biden had a conversation with Hill in which he shared “his regret for what she endured.”\n\nHill, in an interview with The New York Times, declined to call the conversation an apology and said she thought Biden failed to grasp the damage he did to her and other victims of sexual harassment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kaitlan Collins", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/biden-inflation-reduction-act-signing/index.html", "title": "Biden signs Inflation Reduction Act into law | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill into law at the White House on Tuesday – marking a major victory for his administration and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nBiden said during a signing ceremony in the State Dining Room that the legislation, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is “one of the most significant laws in our history.”\n\n“With this law, the American people won and the special interests lost,” Biden told an audience of Democratic members of Congress and administration officials. “For a while people doubted whether any of that was going to happen, but we are in a season of substance.”\n\nThe bill signing is the latest celebration of a major legislative accomplishment for Biden this summer, having already held bill signings at the White House last week for a bill aimed at increasing domestic semiconductor production and increasing benefits for veterans affected by toxic burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq. Biden has also chalked up wins on several other fronts in the last few months, including a bipartisan gun reform bill, ordering the successful mission to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, sending billions in aid to Ukraine to help that nation defend itself against Russia’s invasion and helping Finland and Sweden begin the process of joining NATO.\n\nAnd throughout Tuesday’s White House ceremony, the President underscored the significance of what he sees as his administration’s accomplishments – despite being written off when past negotiations for his legislative agenda failed.\n\n“Today, too often do we confuse noise with substance. Too often we confuse setbacks with defeat. Too often we hand the biggest microphones to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing,” the President told the audience. “Making progress in this country, as big and complicated as ours, clearly, is not easy. It’s never been easy. But with unwavering conviction, commitment and patience, progress does come.”\n\nThe act accomplishes several key Biden legislative agenda items, representing the largest climate investment in American history and making major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation will reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt will raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nBiden, in his remarks, offered a blistering criticism of congressional Republicans for voting against the bill, turning their opposition into a call to action at the polls.\n\nHe underscored that “every single Republican in Congress voted against this bill.”\n\n“Every single Republican in Congress voted against lowering prescription drug prices, against lowering health care costs, against the fair tax system. Every single Republican – every single one – voted against tackling the climate crisis, against lowering our energy costs, against creating good paying jobs. My fellow Americans, that’s the choice we face – we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot,” he continued.\n\nA series of events focused on the rollout of the new law is expected to take place in the coming weeks. The White House says Biden will soon host a Cabinet meeting focused on the law’s implementation, travel around the country to highlight the bill’s impact on Americans and take part in a post-Labor Day White House celebration focused on the enactment of the bill.\n\nSenate Democrats had long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin – a major holdout throughout much of Biden’s term in office – played a key role in the legislation, agreeing to a deal that was announced at the end of last month. Schumer and Manchin attended Tuesday’s signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nBiden credited Schumer for the bill’s passage and in a sign of thanks, handed Manchin his pen after signing the bill into law.\n\nManchin later outlined the long, bumpy road to Tuesday’s bill signing, giving Biden “all the credit” for allowing the process to play out on Capitol Hill.\n\n“He knew enough, being a former senator. Sometimes you just gotta let us do what we got to do, and I gave him all the credit for that, and you don’t do something this of this magnitude with him – with the President of the United States – not having involvement on what’s going on,” Manchin told reporters following the bill signing.\n\nManchin also pushed back against a Congressional Budget Office analysis that concluded the new law would have little to no effect on inflation in the short term, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that “they haven’t always been always right” and that the new law “basically puts confidence in the market.”\n\nAnd he also acknowledged it may take time for Americans to feel the effect of the law, surmising that there may be visible progress in “a year or two or three years … but it’s not going to happen in the next two, three, four months.”\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat also addressed Republicans in Congress, blaming what he said were “politics of the day” for their opposition to the bill.\n\nThe bill passed in the Senate earlier this month after 16 hours of amendment votes – known as a vote-a-rama – and the House of Representatives approved the bill along party lines this past Friday.\n\nThe bill Biden signed on Tuesday does not include several provisions that had been previously proposed as part of the President’s plan, including paid family and sick leave, universal pre-kindergarten, an extension of the enhanced child tax credit, as well as provisions to lower the cost of college.\n\nThe key legislative victory comes as the White House plans a major speech for Biden after Labor Day, which is being billed as a hard-hitting kick off for midterm campaigning.\n\nAides are preparing a speech in which the President will tout tangible, long-talked-about wins like lowering prescription drug costs and gun restrictions while hammering Republicans for being extremists who are in the pocket of special interests.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. And it’s not entirely clear whether voters perceptions about the President or his party will improve in the fall following a summer of dismal polling.\n\nA CNN poll released in late July, for example, found that 75% of Democratic voters want their party to nominate someone other than Biden to the presidency in 2024.\n\nNow, the White House is aiming to make the most of a string of wins – including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – as part of a rush to reset his image ahead of the November elections.\n\nBiden on Tuesday appeared to make a campaign pitch focused on his optimism about the future of the country, arguing that he’s been able to deliver long-sought progress to the American people.\n\n“To me, the critical duty of the presidency is to defend what is best about America. … To pursue justice, to ensure fairness and deliver results that create possibilities that all of us can live a life of consequence and prosperity in a nation that’s safe and secure. That’s the job. Fulfilling that pledge to you guides me every single hour of every single day on this job,” Biden said at the signing ceremony.\n\nAmerican presidents, he added, “should be judged, not only by our words but by our deeds, not by our rhetoric but by our actions, not by our promise but by reality. And today is part of an extraordinary story that’s being written by this administration and our brave allies in the Congress.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/white-house-easter-egg-roll-resumes/index.html", "title": "White House Easter Egg Roll set to resume in April | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus due to concerns over the spread of Covid-19, the White House Easter Egg Roll is set to take place April 18, according to a release from the White House.\n\nThe Easter Egg Roll is the most popular publicly attended annual event hosted by the White House, which welcomes thousands of people over the course of the day to participate in festivities on the South Lawn.\n\nIt’s a tradition that’s been observed nearly every year since 1878, the most recent exceptions being 2020 and 2021, when first ladies Melania Trump and Jill Biden, respectively, opted to cancel the event in light of the global coronavirus pandemic. A lottery for members of the public to obtain free tickets to this year’s Easter Egg Roll opens Friday, March 25, and runs through Thursday, March 31.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden appear with the Easter Bunny at the White House on April 5, 2021. The 2021 Easter Egg Roll was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe White House is typically the hub of social activity for an administration, with several hundred events, public and private, held there each year. However, as the country grappled with the spread of Covid-19, the “People’s House” has also been relatively subdued – public tours were postponed, the annual Halloween festivities canceled and holiday parties, of which there are typically several dozen during the month of December, were dramatically scaled back.\n\nThursday’s Easter Egg Roll announcement also included news of rescheduled Spring Garden Tours, which are free and open to members of the public. This year’s tour dates are April 9 and 10.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House announced the resumption of public tours, which commence April 15.\n\nWhile the latest developments don’t mark a return to a full, pre-pandemic schedule, the decision to reopen the White House for tours and events heralds a tentative return to normalcy.\n\nPrior to the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, an annual Easter Egg Roll for children and families took place on Capitol Hill, but complaints about the destruction to the grassy areas moved the event to the White House. In 1878, according to an article that ran in the evening edition of the Evening Star, per the National Archives, the first White House Easter Egg Roll was a success: “Driven out of the Capitol grounds, the children advanced on the White House grounds to-day and rolled eggs down the terraces back of the Mansion, and played among the shrubbery to their heart’s content.”\n\nOne hundred and forty-two years later, the tradition is on track to continue.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/01/george-floyd-protest-arrests-dc-chicago-minneapolis/5305001002/", "title": "George Floyd protest live updates: Funeral to be held June 9 in ...", "text": "George Floyd's funeral will be held June 9 in Houston.

Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled.\n\nUnder heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House.\n\nEarlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure.

Here's the latest news:\n\nFloyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston\n\nFamily attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said.\n\nCrump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.\n\nBoxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions.\n\nProtesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots\n\nCalling himself \"your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago.\n\n\"As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden.\n\nBefore Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, \"Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them.\n\nTrump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C.\n\nFamily autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide\n\nAn autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said.\n\nThe family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene.\n\n“What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.”\n\nFloyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe.\n\n\"The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. \"From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.''\n\nThe Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a \"cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted \"fentanyl intoxication'' and \"recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd.\n\nTwo Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests.\n\nFloyd's brother calls for peaceful protests\n\nWearing a mask that read \"We can't breathe'' on one half and \"Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner.\n\nTerrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive.\n\n\"My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. \"Let's do this another way.''\n\nFloyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote.\n\n\"Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. \"Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.''\n\nThe crowd, which had earlier chanted, \"Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: \"One down, three to go.''\n\nThough all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder.\n\nTrump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people'\n\nPresident Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses.\n\n“Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.”\n\nMore than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day.\n\nDisturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters\n\nThe sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nIn New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic.\n\nIt's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds.\n\n-- Ryan W. Miller\n\nLouisville police chief fired after another killing\n\nGreg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew.\n\nPolice and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a \"large crowd\" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured.\n\n-- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nProtests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks\n\nProtests can be \"breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19.\n\nFocus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests.\n\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,\" Mina said. \"I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests.\"\n\nKen Alltucker and Karen Weintraub\n\nChicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire'\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night.\n\nChicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she \"did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn.\"\n\n“The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,\" she said.\n\nPolice chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says\n\nGeorge Floyd's death was \"unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,\" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries \"that has included institutional racism\" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action \"within their legal authority\" to hold officers accountable.\n\n\"We need to hear what America is telling us right now,\" the statement said. \"We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised.\"\n\nFederal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House\n\nRiot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday.\n\nA weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nIn New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested\n\nSetting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday.\n\nPolice cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers \"showed restraint\" amid the mayhem.\n\nDe Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the \"Today\" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce.\n\n“The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,\" Shea said. \"And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on.\"\n\nMore news about the George Floyd protests\n\nJournalists attacked by officers, protesters\n\nAs protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. \"I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,\" she said she told police.\n\nCarlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations \"show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them.\"\n\n– Lorenzo Reyes\n\n3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday.

Instead, he was celebrating one of his signature achievements, the Affordable Care Act, alongside the man who served with him in the building for eight years.\n\n“It feels like the good old days,” President Joe Biden said alongside his onetime boss, whose return to the East Room resembled a reunion of his top allies, many of whom are now serving in Biden’s Cabinet or in Congress.\n\n“It is good to be back in the White House. It’s been a while,” Obama said when he began his remarks. “I confess I heard some changes have been made by the current President since I was last here. Apparently Secret Service agents have to wear aviator sunglasses now. The Navy Mess has been replaced by a Baskin-Robbins. And there’s a cat running around.”\n\nObama began his speech by addressing his host as “Vice President Biden” before quickly correcting himself. “That was a joke!” he exclaimed, walking over to give Biden a hug. “That was all set up. My President, Joe Biden.”\n\nTwo people close to Obama later said it had been a slip of the tongue, and not how Obama had intended to begin his remarks touting the legacy of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe episode hardly ranks high on the list of presidential gaffes that either man has made over the years. Yet it did cause at least a few eyes to roll among Biden loyalists, who have long questioned whether Obama views his successor as an equal.\n\nBiden and Obama were announcing steps the White House says will make health care more affordable, including closing a loophole that prevents millions of Americans from qualifying for subsidies.\n\nStill, that it took more than a year for Biden to welcome his former boss to the White House reflects his desire to stake out a presidency of his own, even as the timing of the visit makes clear he is not opposed to seeking help as Democrats brace for a bruising midterm election season.\n\nWith many of Biden’s legislative priorities stalled, Obama on Tuesday seemed to offer a preview of Democrats’ midterm message.\n\n“Progress feels way too slow sometimes. Victories are often incomplete,” he said, citing the health law as an example of persistence in governing.\n\nAfter two terms working in Obama’s shadow, Biden has strived at moments to differentiate himself from his predecessor, most noticeably on foreign policy. And Obama has been cognizant of allowing Biden room to govern as his own man.\n\nWhile Obama has occasionally spoken to Biden over the last year, their telephone conversations have been infrequent, according to people close to both men, and they have seen each other only a few times over the last 15 months – despite Obama residing only 10 minutes away from the White House in Washington.\n\nIn public, each likes to play up a warm friendship that developed over Obama’s presidency. Biden often slips a reference to “Barack” in his remarks, harkening back to a piece of advice or an inside joke they shared. Sometimes the results are somewhat pained: On “Best Friends Day” in 2019, Biden shared an image of friendship bracelets with “Joe” and “Barack” written in beads.\n\n“They are real friends, not just Washington friends,” press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. “I’m sure they will talk about events in the world as well as their families and personal lives.”\n\nShe said it was “exactly the right time” for Obama to return to the White House after more than five years away.\n\nWhen Obama visited the White House on Tuesday, he joined Biden for lunch in addition to attending the health care event in the Rose Garden. Obama and Biden had lunch together every week when they served in the White House.\n\n“We weren’t sure who was supposed to sit where,” Biden said during the East Room event afterward.\n\nThe visit was viewed as a success by both Biden and Obama, aides told CNN.\n\nThe former President lingered at the White House for about an hour for private conversations, and caught up with several of his former staffers who work in the Biden administration including Psaki, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and deputy White House chief of staff Jennifer O’Malley Dillon.\n\nStill, there have been limits to the Biden-Obama friendship. Biden revealed last year that he had been invited into Obama’s private residence only once over their eight years together in the White House. They have vastly different personalities and working styles. And their relationship has been colored by various slights, real or perceived, that still linger.\n\nObama declined to endorse Biden over other Democrats in the 2020 primary, a step both men insisted was necessary to allow a true contest within the party. Four years earlier, Obama had viewed Hillary Clinton as his Democratic successor instead of Biden, who decided not to run as he grappled with his son’s death.\n\nAll that makes Tuesday’s event a significant moment for each man. For Obama, it also marks the beginning of a string of public events, including a keynote speech on disinformation that he’ll deliver at Stanford later this month.\n\nA popular surrogate emerges\n\nHis return to the White House is the first sign of what many Democrats hope will be his increased involvement in the 2022 midterm elections. The former President and former first lady Michelle Obama are two of the most sought-after party leaders – expected to be in high demand by Senate and House candidates this year.\n\nThat could potentially stand in contrast to Biden, whose approval ratings remain near historic lows heading into campaign season. Biden is eager to campaign for Democrats in the coming year, but has also made known he is open to any role his party sees as helpful.\n\nObama is no stranger to uphill midterm battles; he endured losses in both 2010 and 2014. Yet he left office with an approval rating among the highest for any departing president, and remains popular among Democrats.\n\nThe Obamas have not yet determined how visible they intend to be in the fall campaign, but aides say they will both devote time to Democratic efforts to maintain control of the House and Senate.\n\nThe decision to have Obama appear alongside Biden at the White House this week was designed to shine a brighter light on one of the often-overlooked achievements of the Biden administration: strengthening the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt’s reminiscent of former President Bill Clinton coming to the White House to help explain the economic efforts employed by Obama during the fiscal crisis in the early years of his tenure. That appearance, in 2010, was remembered principally for Clinton holding court from the briefing room podium for half an hour – long after Obama had exited the room.\n\nThe health care law remains one of the lasting legacies of the Obama administration. When it passed, Biden made one of his most infamous asides when he whispered to Obama that it was a “big f**king deal.”\n\nIt’s no small irony that the messy health care fight – one of the central reasons Democrats lost control of Congress on Obama’s watch more than a decade ago – ended in a law now seen as broadly popular with Americans. Republicans have all but dropped their efforts to repeal and replace it after failing to do so for years.\n\n“Given all the noise and the controversy and the skepticism, it took a while for the American people to understand what we had done, but, lo and behold – a little later than I’d expected – a lot of folks, including many who had initially opposed health care reform, came around,” Obama said during his remarks Tuesday. “And today, the ACA hasn’t just survived, it’s pretty darn popular.”\n\nObama has remained engaged on the law since leaving office, taping videos encouraging Americans to enroll and breaking a near-silence on political issues to criticize Republicans for attempting to undermine it. He and Biden appeared in a video together last August encouraging Americans to sign up, one of their only joint appearances since Biden took office.\n\n“We’re going to get even more people covered in the years to come under your guidance,” Obama told Biden in the video. “Love you, man.”\n\nSigning off, as Obama told Biden he was proud of him, the sitting President said to expect him to stay in touch.\n\n“I’m still going to call you for advice,” Biden said.\n\nObama’s visit to the White House on Tuesday will not be his last.\n\nPlans have been underway for months for the formal unveiling of his portrait – a presidential rite of passage that was disrupted during the Trump administration and delayed during the first year of the Biden administration, when the Covid-19 pandemic limited such events at the White House.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/white-house-wedding-naomi-biden/index.html", "title": "Naomi Biden: President's granddaughter announces White House ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe eldest grandchild of President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden has announced she will be married in a ceremony on the White House’s South Lawn later this year.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, Naomi Biden provided an update to her nuptial plans.\n\n“Sooo not sure how best to update but was supposed to do so weeks ago…but we have finally figured out where the ceremony will be…and much to the relief of secret service and with the dogs’ endorsement…we’ll be getting married on the South Lawn!” she said on Twitter. “Couldn’t be more excited.”\n\nNaomi Biden in April said she and fiancé Peter Neal would only be holding their wedding reception at the White House, with a ceremony to take place elsewhere. However, now Naomi Biden says her wedding plans have shifted to take place fully at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nNaomi Biden’s tweet included a photograph of the White House South Lawn, taken from the vantage point of the south side of the White House. The South Lawn of the White House is a vast green space of several acres, maintained by the National Park Service. It is the location of recreational areas of White House space, including tennis courts, a putting green and the White House Kitchen Garden; it is also home to the traditional White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nThe South Lawn can function as a ceremonial venue for certain official state visits, and it is the predominant take-off and landing point for Marine One, the presidential helicopter that ferries the President to and from various locations. It has not been, as of yet, been the site of a modern presidential familial wedding ceremony.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that taxpayer funds would not be used for the wedding ceremony. She would not say whether the press would be granted access to the event.\n\n“I can ensure to you that taxpayer dollars will not go to that,” she said at the press briefing. “That is a personal affair that is happening. That is not White House business, so I cannot speak to that from here.”\n\nNaomi Biden, 28, is the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle. She is a lawyer, currently based in Washington, DC. Biden got engaged to Peter Neal, 24, in September of last year when Neal proposed near his childhood home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, according to a White House official.\n\nBiden’s engagement ring includes the band of Neal’s grandmother’s engagement ring. The couple has been together for approximately four years, after meeting in New York City on a date that was set up by a mutual friend. Neal graduated from law school this spring at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe White House has a long history as the location for weddings of presidential offspring, dating back to the 1800s, when the children of James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, John Tyler and Ulysses S. Grant were married there. Both of Woodrow Wilson’s daughters held their weddings at the White House, as well as his niece, in 1913, 1914 and 1918, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Lynda Bird Johnson, daughter of Lyndon B. Johnson, was married in the White House East Room in 1967. Her sister, Luci Johnson, held her reception at the White House the year prior, following a ceremony at a nearby church.\n\nTricia Nixon was walked down the aisle in the Rose Garden by her father, Richard Nixon, when she married Edward Cox in 1971.\n\nIn June 2008, George W. Bush and Laura Bush hosted a White House wedding reception with 600 guests for their daughter, Jenna Bush, whose wedding ceremony had occurred the month prior at the Bush family ranch in Crawford, Texas.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/politics/biden-taiwan-china-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Biden says US would respond 'militarily' if China attacked Taiwan ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that the United States would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don’t reflect a change in US policy. It’s the third time in recent months – including during a CNN town hall in October – that Biden has said the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack, only to have the White House walk back those remarks.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Biden was asked if the US would be willing to go further to help Taiwan in the event of an invasion than it did with Ukraine.\n\n“You didn’t want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” a reporter asked.\n\n“Yes,” Biden replied. “That’s the commitment we made.”\n\n“We agree with the One China policy. We signed on to it, and all the attendant agreements made from there, but the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is (just not) appropriate,” he said.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan 02:41 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s strong warning was made right on China’s doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President. The visit is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China’s rising influence. It also came a day before Biden is scheduled to attend the second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) – an informal grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India that has alarmed Beijing.\n\nSeveral of Biden’s top administration officials were caught off-guard by the remarks, several aides told CNN, adding that they were not expecting Biden to be so unequivocal.\n\nIn a statement following Biden’s comments, a White House official said the US’ official position remained unchanged.\n\n“As the President said, our policy has not changed. He reiterated our One China policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,” the official said.\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to Biden’s comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its “internal affairs.”\n\n“On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n“We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle … be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won’t cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, “We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. … Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.”\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn’t stopped China’s ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that “reunification” between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it “expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.”\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, “It will dislocate the entire region,” and emphasizing “Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.”\n\n“And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine – if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there’s a rapprochement … between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?”\n\nBiden said that China is “already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’re undertaking.”\n\n“But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we’ve done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,” he said.\n\n“As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,” he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to “fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capability.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd Nectar Gan", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/white-house-wedding-naomi-biden/index.html", "title": "Naomi Biden's wedding offers youthful spin for president turning 80 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is turning 80 this weekend, but the big bash at the White House is for an entirely different and more youthful occasion. Naomi Biden, Biden’s oldest granddaughter, married Peter Neal on the White House South Lawn on Saturday.\n\nOne day following the nuptials, Biden will mark his spot in American history as the only octogenarian president, a numerical milestone that shines a spotlight on a primary issue plaguing Biden with his opponents: his age. Despite a spate of recent wins – better-than-projected midterm elections for Democrats, a relatively gaffe-less trip to Egypt and Asia, and a lackluster presidential announcement from his old rival, Donald Trump – Biden cannot shake being the oldest commander-in-chief America has ever had.\n\nBut a glossy wedding of two twenty-somethings, kicking off a fresh life chapter with music and dancing and revelry, could put a youthful spin on the 80th birthday weekend. Two people familiar with the planning of the wedding say it was not a coincidence Naomi Biden’s wedding weekend coincides with the president’s day – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\n“The wedding gives some cover,” says one of the people.\n\nThe wedding, which CNN is told includes the extended Biden clan on the guest list, as well as friends and family of the couple, also marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether Joe Biden should run for a second term.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Jill Biden and Joe Biden will travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the Thanksgiving holiday; Christmas follows quickly on its heels, as the clock ticks toward Biden’s need to say whether he will be in for 2024, or out. Both the president and the first lady have said they will weigh the pros and cons of a second run, something Biden has previously said he “intends” to undertake.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal, Saturday, November 19, 2022 on the South Lawn. Adam Schultz/White House\n\nA family affair\n\nThe wedding itself consists of three parts, a person familiar with the planning told CNN. The ceremony, which was set to begin at approximately 11:15 am ET and ended at 11:50 am, took place on the South Lawn – a location that hadn’t previously been used for a White House wedding. There was no tent, the source had confirmed earlier, which made for a chilly outdoor morning, with the temperature at 39 degrees. Guests arrived early Saturday morning to the White House complex, where they were all administered Covid-19 tests, two people familiar told CNN. They were given blankets and shawls at their seats to keep warm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the wedding details, the bride’s parents, Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked her down the aisle. As Naomi Biden walked down the aisle, the band played “Bitter Sweet Symphony” by The Verve. The bride wore a long-sleeved gown with a veil and train, designed by Ralph Lauren, the same sources said.\n\nJoe Biden escorted Neal’s two grandmothers – Paulita Neal and Betty Thum – down the aisle to their seats, a source said. The president then turned back and did a “classic Biden jog” up the aisle, according to the source, to meet the first lady and walk her down the aisle to their seats.\n\nThe program, which was seen by CNN, listed Naomi’s sister Finnegan James Biden as her maid of honor and her sister Roberta Mabel Biden, also known as Maisy, and Katherine Elizabeth Neal as bridesmaids. The groom’s best man was his brother Robert Eliot Neal, and groomsmen were listed as Joseph Robinette Biden IV and Charles W. Gerdts.\n\nPeter’s father, Dr. William Neal, who was accompanied by vocalists, sang a song during the ceremony, the source said. There was also a reading of the poem “I Carry Your Heart With Me” by E.E. Cummings, which was read by Amy D’Amato.\n\nThe bride and groom wrote their own vows for the ceremony, according to the source.\n\n“It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,” the president and first lady said in a statement released by the White House on Saturday. “Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we’re honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.”\n\nNotable attendees included former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Ted Kaufman of Delaware, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, who has served as White House Cabinet secretary.\n\nFollowing the exchange of vows, a smaller, family-and-wedding-party-only luncheon took place in the White House.\n\nThe celebration continued Saturday night, with approximately 325 guests – more than attended the ceremony – invited to the White House for dancing and dessert. The black-tie reception began at approximately 7:30 pm ET and was scheduled to end at midnight.\n\nThe president and first lady mingled with guests, according to two people in attendance who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. Guests were asked to relinquish their cell phones, the sources said.\n\nA massive, seven-tier wedding cake was positioned in the Blue Room, and Naomi Biden and her husband Peter Neal used a small ladder to climb up and cut into an upper tier. Guests were given slices of the cake as parting gifts – a tradition that Tricia Nixon, Lynda Johnson and Luci Johnson all did at their White House receptions.\n\nDessert stations were set up in the State Dining Room, and a large band was playing on a stage erected in the East Room.\n\nThe bride wore a strapless Reem Acra dress, according to the two people; she was also scheduled to change into a second party dress later in the evening.\n\nThe grandchild closest – literally – to her grandfather\n\nIn a way, Naomi Biden, 28, experienced a White House wedding thanks in large part to her own gumption. Biden, an associate at the Washington, DC, law firm Arnold & Porter, pushed her grandfather to run the first time.\n\nThough the patriarch, Joe Biden has always included his larger family circle, including his five oldest grandchildren when weighing life choices. His sensitivity to their feelings, and the invasive nature of a nasty political battle weigh heavy on his mind.\n\n“I don’t think there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family,” said Naomi Biden in a video interview played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThough typically called by the elder Biden family members, it was Naomi Biden who convened the most critical, in-person, all-hands-on-deck family meeting, the one that would have the most impact on Joe Biden’s future. Biden was concerned – they, however, were not.\n\n“He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to [run,] but really were calling it to be like, ‘Get in that race! Hurry up!’” said Naomi Biden. In the years since, it has been Naomi who has been most publicly vocal on her social media channels about Democratic issues, and championing her grandfather. On November 12, she tweeted, “Democracy wins in the Senate. Never think your vote doesn’t matter.”\n\nNaomi is also the grandchild closest – literally – to her grandparents. She and Neal, 25, a recent University of Pennsylvania Law School graduate who works at Georgetown University Law Center on National Security, moved into the White House last August, a person familiar with the living arrangements tells CNN.\n\nThe close proximity to the couple’s wedding site only increased their involvement in the planning. Jill Biden was primarily the person involved in the wedding planning, CNN is told, working with wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli, founder of Rafanelli Events. Rafanelli is no stranger to whipping up fantastical parties at the White House; he oversaw seven State Dinners during Barack Obama’s presidency, including the final of the administration for Italy, which included a tent with a glass ceiling on the South Lawn and a performance by Gwen Stefani.\n\nHe also planned and orchestrated the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010.\n\nA Rafanelli-produced wedding is not an inexpensive endeavor. The price tag for many of his events starts at around $300,000 and can go into the millions of dollars. “Consistent with other private events hosted by the First Family and following the traditions of previous White House wedding festivities in prior Administrations, the Biden family will be paying for the wedding activities that occur at the White House,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN.\n\nNaomi Biden’s parents, who divorced in 2017, have each written memoirs about struggles in their relationship, many of which involved Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction.\n\nNeal’s family is from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the couple was engaged in September 2021. (The engagement ring includes the band of Neal’s grandmother’s engagement ring and was designed by a DC jeweler, a person with knowledge of its construction told CNN.)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal on Saturday, November 19, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House.

Reuters In pictures: A history of White House weddings Prev Next\n\nThe social event of the White House this year\n\nNaomi Biden’s choice of a Ralph Lauren as the designer of her wedding dress was not a total surprise; several fashion insiders previously contacted by CNN had speculated that the job had gone to Lauren, perhaps the most iconic American fashion designer alive today.\n\nJoe Biden is partial to Lauren’s suits, having worn one on Inauguration Day, and Jill Biden has also been photographed wearing the label. In March, Naomi and her sister Finnegan, 23, and Neal, attended Ralph Lauren’s Fall 2022 fashion show in New York City, which sparked most of the chatter that she will wear the designer for at least one of her wedding looks. The White House did not comment on the dress speculation, but two people familiar told CNN the bride would wear two different wedding looks, one for the ceremony and one for the reception.\n\nDespite several protestations from the White House Correspondents’ Association, asking that media coverage be allowed as the wedding is taking place at the people’s house, the White House was adamant that the bride and groom wanted privacy for their nuptials.\n\nFloral garlands of white roses and other blooms were hung from the Truman Balcony, and woven along the staircases down to the South Lawn; large matching wreaths and a floral arch surround the entrance to the Diplomatic Room. It is only the 19th wedding to ever take place at the White House, the last one was for Obama’s chief photographer, Pete Souza, who in 2013 was married in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe last presidential daughter to celebrate a wedding at the White House was Jenna Bush in June 2008. Bush held her wedding and reception months prior at the Bush family’s Texas ranch, but her father, George W. Bush, hosted approximately 600 guests at the White House for his daughter’s second reception.\n\nBut the scope and scale of the Biden wedding most correlates with that of Luci Johnson, who held her reception in the East Room after marrying Patrick Nugent, and Lynda Johnson, who in 1967 married Charles Robb in the East Room of the White House.

Biden will deliver a message recognizing this week as \"Community Violence Awareness Week.\"\n\nWhite House officials will later host a roundtable discussion on gun violence with Black elected officials from across the country. It will be followed by a virtual workshop to connect state and local leaders to federal resources to address gun violence including community safety programs.\n\nThe week, which coincides with Black History Month, will culminate Friday with a White House ceremony hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris to honor 31 graduates of the inaugural class of trainees from the University of Chicago Crime Lab’s Community Violence Intervention Leadership Academy.\n\n\"Gun violence is a public health crisis that impacts our communities every day,\" said Greg Jackson, deputy director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. \"And while we know we need action from Congress, there's a lot we can do to create an all-of-government approach to this health crisis, and our team is charged with that.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBiden launched the Office of Gun Violence Prevention in September to expedite the implementation of executive actions he's taken on gun violence and measures in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which passed in 2022 as the first significant overhaul in federal firearms laws in 30 years.\n\nThe law created a $750 million funding pot to incentivize states to create \"red flag laws,\" which allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from individuals who pose a danger.\n\nBiden has responded to mass shootings in the U.S. by repeatedly calling on Congress to take additional action: reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and pass legislation requiring gun background checks with gun purchases. His efforts have not found momentum because of resistance from Republicans in Congress, however.\n\nBiden, who needs Black voters to get behind his reelection bid in the fall, has worked to show he's delivered for their communities, last month touting a \"small business boom\" among Black-owned businesses during his presidency.\n\nAfter gun violence spiked during the pandemic, 2023 saw an overall decrease in gun violence − dropping by 12.4%, according to the White House − including in major cities such as Baltimore, St. Louis and Detroit.\n\n\"We think that's a direct result of the historic investments we have made to prevent and intervene in community violence across the country,\" Jackson said, pointing to funding in the American Rescue Plan law that went to cities to address public safety.\n\nThe Office of Gun Violence Prevention's mission is to also identify future actions to reduce gun violence, expand partnerships with local and state leaders to address gun violence and expand federal support for victims and families of victims of gun violence.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly known as Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}]}

What to know about the Oklahoma ...", "text": "Less than two months after unleashing his \"American Heartbreak,\" Zach Bryan has the \"Summertime Blues.\"\n\nOklahoma's latest breakout country music star is releasing a new nine-track EP titled \"Summertime Blues\" Friday, closely following his record-breaking, critically-acclaimed May 20 Warner Records debut with the epic album \"American Heartbreak.\"\n\nThe industrious singer-songwriter - who in the past two years has morphed from a DIY viral standout into a genuine country music sensation - has already given his burgeoning, enthusiastic fan base a look and listen to the EP's wistful title track. If the familiar neon signage is any indication, the \"Summertime Blues\" video was apparently filmed in part at the Tumbleweed Dance Hall in Stillwater, where Bryan was among the headliners earlier this year at iconic venue's 30th annual Calf Fry.\n\nWarner Records promises the new EP will have Bryan singing about the working-class life on \"Quittin' Time,\" about the one who got away on \"Oklahoma Smoke Show\" and about a relationship gone wrong on \"All the Time.\"\n\n\"Summertime Blues\" is the follow-up to \"American Heartbreak,\" Bryan’s first official studio album and first for Warner Records. Upon its spring release, it became the second-highest streaming country music album debut in history, breaking the 2022 record for single album streams in a 24-hour period and pushing Bryan well past 1 billion global streams.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about the 26-year-old Oklahoma singer-songwriter with the poetic pen and raspy voice who is emerging as a country music powerhouse:\n\n1. Where is Zach Bryan from?\n\nBryan hails from Oologah, which means he shares his hometown with the late, great humorist, movie star and trick roper Will Rogers (1870–1935), whose birthplace is just outside the Rogers County town.\n\nAhead of his 2021 debut on the Grand Ole Opry, the iconic show's producers sent a crew to Oologah to film Bryan. Along the way, he pointed out the first bar he ever played a show at: Tulsa's Rabbit Hole Bar and Grill.\n\n\"When I was 14, we started making these dumb songs up, me and my buddies sitting around, and I just never really expected to be a musician, ever. But I always wanted to write songs. That's what I wanted to do: I wanted to be a songwriter,\" he said.\n\nFun fact: His new album features two songs named for Sooner State towns in the acoustic odes \"Oklahoma City\" and \"Tishomingo.\" (The latter includes one of my favorite instances of Bryan's canny wordplay, as he rhymes the name of the Johnston County seat with the line \"wonder where good men's dreams go.\")\n\n2. Zach Bryan is a veteran whose family has a long history of military service\n\nAlthough the prolific singer-songwriter is proud of his small-town roots in Oologah, Bryan was actually born in Okinawa, Japan. That's because he comes from a long line of U.S. Navy servicemen and women.\n\nBoth his parents, his grandfather, his uncles and his great-grandfather have all served, he told the Opry film crew.\n\n\"It was really cool being able to grow up like that. They say 'Navy brat' ... but I learned a lot,\" he said.\n\nBryan joined the Navy when he was 17 and served for eight years. He posted on Instagram last fall that he had been honorably discharged \"to go play some music.\"\n\n\"Can’t tell if I’m a coward or if I’m chasing a dream but regardless, the best eight years of my life were spent serving the best country in the whole damn world,\" he wrote at the time.\n\n\"It made a man out of me, truly.\"\n\n3. His meteoric rise started with a YouTube breakout\n\nEven when he was on active duty, music was a big part of Bryan's life. In 2017, he started uploading his music to YouTube in the form of unedited performance videos his friends filmed on his phone.\n\nIn 2019, Bryan and his buddies recorded his debut album, \"DeAnn,\" in a Florida Airbrb using equipment from Guitar Center. He named the self-funded and self-released collection for his late mother.\n\nShortly after he released \"DeAnn,\" Bryan posted a sweaty one-take performance clip for \"Heading South,\" the first single from his sophomore album. The acoustic anthem went viral: The original video — recorded behind his Navy barracks on a humid 95-degree day — has been viewed more than 15.5 million times since its September 2019 release, while a studio version dropped on YouTube by Warner Records has earned more than 10.5 million views since December 2020.\n\nBy the time he made his Opry debut, the studio version of \"Heading South\" had surpassed 30 million Spotify plays. The song, featured on his 2020 album \"Elisabeth,\" was certified gold last fall by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n\"I feel incredibly blessed. I can't believe it happened so quick. It's been an incredible ride,\" Bryan told The Tennessean ahead of his Opry bow.\n\n4. Zach Bryan's 'American Heartbreak' boasts more than 30 tracks\n\nBryan's loyal and growing fan base had already been treated to six singles from his Warner Records debut — “Whiskey Fever,” along with “Open The Gate,” “Something in the Orange,” “Highway Boys,” “From Austin” and “Late July”— when it bowed May 20.\n\nBut that was just a fraction of the music his \"American Heartbreak\" has to offer: Bryan's major-label debut is a triple album boasting a whopping 34 tracks — and he had a hand in writing all of them.\n\nListening to the 33 songs and one poem on \"American Heartbreak\" is a two-hour commitment, but the album shows off his distinctive sound, a blend of Americana, folk, outlaw country and Heartland rock that should appeal to fans of Oklahoma's Red Dirt music scene. (Bryan wore a Turnpike Troubadours T-shirt when he made his Grand Ole Opry debut and has paid homage to the beloved Oklahoma band's frontman and songwriter Evan Felker in song.)\n\n\"I feel like it's a songwriter's job to analyze everything in his head and put that out in the world how he interpreted it,\" Bryan told The Tennessean last year. \"And maybe somebody else can interpret it the same way. There's so much stuff ... going on around you all the time that's so hard to explain. By writing songs you can try your best and hope people relate.\"\n\nHe recorded the new album in New York at the famed Electric Lady Studios.\n\n\"I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd heard, so I wanted to go somewhere ... country artists or Americana/folk artists don't usually go,\" Bryan said in new interview for Spotify.\n\nThe album includes 33 originals and his arrangement of the iconic song \"You Are My Sunshine,\" which Bryan has acknowledged was \"too many.\"\n\n\"At one point, I had like written, like, the saddest album of all time, so I just kept writing and kept writing,\" he said. \"Touring's cool, but I'm more into the writing and making of good music.\"\n\n5. 'Something in the Orange' helped earn Bryan 1 billion streams\n\nWith its May 20 bow, \"American Heartbreak\" became the most-streamed single-day country release of 2022 on Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThe epic debuted at No. 5 on Billboard’s all-genre Top 200 Albums chart and No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums list. \"American Heartbreak\" marked Bryan's Billboard 200 bow, entering with 71,500 equivalent album units earned — the biggest week for a country album in 2022.\n\nHe recently hit No. 1 on the Country Songwriters list, and his vivid ballad \"Something in the Orange” peaked just outside the Top 10 on the Hot Country Songs chart at No. 11.\n\nOn the day of his album’s release, Bryan hit No. 14 on the U.S. trends on TikTok and in the Top 30 on Twitter. Plus, 24 of the album's 34 tracks charted that day among Billboard's Hot Country Songs.\n\nHis fervent single “From Austin” topped the country songs roster on Apple Music upon its release, debuted at No. 4 on Spotify’s Global Country chart and has racked up more than 37 million global streams.\n\nAlong with the Turnpike Troubadours, Lainey Wilson, Ryan Bingham and more, Bryan's music also has been featured on the smash series \"Yellowstone.\"\n\n6. Where are Zach Bryan's next tour, concerts in 2022?\n\nBryan is already gaining a reputation for his raucous live performances, including attention-grabbing festival sets this year at Stagecoach in Indio, California, Lollapalooza in Chicago and Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee.\n\nHe's been selling out tour dates as fast as he's been scaling the charts, and he's just added a few more shows to his itinerary.\n\nFor Oklahoma fans, it looks like the best bet to catch the singer-songwriter live still will be when he plays a home-state show at the second Born & Raised Music Festival, set for Sept. 16-18 in Pryor.\n\nBryan was on the original lineup for the music and camping fest, which was initially planned for 2020 but had to be delayed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By the time the inaugural Born & Raised Music Festival actually took place last year, he had moved up significantly on the event's roster. Now, he's headlining the Friday night lineup.\n\nFor tickets and information, go to https://www.bornandraisedfestival.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/bluey-new-episodes/72110839007/", "title": "New episodes of 'Bluey' out today on Disney+.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/tech/us-chip-manufacturing-semiconductors/index.html", "title": "The US is spending billions to boost chip manufacturing. Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/us-saudi-uae-proposed-arms-deal/index.html", "title": "Biden admin approves potential multibillion-dollar arms sales to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday approved and notified Congress of possible multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe notice of the approval comes just weeks after President Joe Biden met with the leaders of each nation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as he sought to improve relations between the US and the Saudis.\n\nThe approval was also notified on the same day that the United Nations announced a two-month extension of the truce in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebel group had, until recent months, been engaged in a years-long bloody conflict that has killed thousands of civilians.\n\nAccording to a news release from the US State Department, the agency approved a possible sale of PATRIOT MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical Ballistic Missiles (GEM-T) and related equipment to Saudi Araba for an estimated $3.05 billion.\n\n“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Gulf region,” the State Department said of the sale.\n\n“The proposed sale will improve the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by replenishing its dwindling stock of PATRIOT GEM-T missiles,” it said. “These missiles are used to defend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s borders against persistent Houthi cross-border unmanned aerial system and ballistic missile attacks on civilian sites and critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.”\n\n“These attacks threaten the well-being of Saudi, International, and U.S. citizens (approximately 70,000) residing in the Kingdom.

Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/tech/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition/index.html", "title": "Microsoft acquires gaming giant Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMicrosoft on Tuesday announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard in a blockbuster deal worth nearly $70 billion. It’s one of the biggest acquisitions in the tech industry in recent years, one that will boost Microsoft’s standing in the growing gaming industry but could be complicated by recent concerns about Activision’s toxic culture.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is valued at $68.7 billion, and Microsoft says it will make the company the third-largest gaming company by revenue, after Tencent and Sony.\n\nBobby Kotick, the controversial CEO of Activision Blizzard, will continue in his role, according to a press release detailing the announced acquisition. Activision employees had previously staged walkouts and called on Kotick to step down for having allegedly been aware of widespread harassment and discrimination problems at the company for years.\n\nCalifornia’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in August 2021 alleging a “frat boy” work culture that subjected female employees to discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay. It further alleged that “the company’s executives and human resources personnel knew of the harassment and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the unlawful conduct, and instead retaliated against women who complained.”\n\nJ. Allen Brack, Activision’s then-President, left his post following the allegations, and Activision hired an outside firm to investigate, taking cues from other corporate scandal-ridden companies like Uber.\n\nActivision Blizzard also agreed to an $18 million settlement in September in response to a separate lawsuit from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That suit had accused the company of subjecting female employees to sexual harassment and retaliating against them for complaining about harassment, and alleged it had “discriminated against employees due to their pregnancy.”\n\nThe news follows several months of reporting about allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior by Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates in the company’s earlier years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that the company’s culture had evolved since then, and emphasized its focus on diversity and inclusion.\n\n“We believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment,” said Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO, in an official statement Tuesday. “We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.”\n\nThe agreement is pending regulatory review and Activision Blizzard shareholder approval, with the deal set to close in 2023. The companies will continue to operate independently until the transaction is finalized, after which Activision Blizzard will report to Spencer. Activision Blizzard’s stock shot up more than 30% ahead of the market open Tuesday morning; Microsoft shares fell around 1.5%.\n\nGaming has become a major point of focus for Microsoft in recent years, especially as the pandemic meant more people were staying home and using gaming systems. In January 2021, on the heels of huge demand for its Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, Microsoft’s gaming revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time.\n\nThe acquisition would boost Microsoft’s gaming business with the addition of Activision Blizzard games and the nearly 400 million monthly active players that come with them. Microsoft will also acquire Activision’s global game studios and its nearly 10,000 employees, according to the company.\n\nMicrosoft’s plans for cloud gaming will be accelerated by the deal, with the company hoping to push the Xbox community onto phone, tablets, laptops and other devices globally. And popular titles from Activision such as “Candy Crush” will improve Microsoft’s position in mobile gaming, too.\n\n“Acquiring Activision will help jump start MSFT’s broader gaming endeavors and ultimately its move into the metaverse with gaming the first monetization piece of the metaverse in our opinion,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe metaverse has been hailed as the next big thing for the tech industry — although there’s still a long way to go until such a virtual world is a reality, video games are likely to play a central role.\n\n“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement.\n\nThe deal could face significant scrutiny both in the United States and abroad from lawmakers and regulators, who have recently been focused on antitrust concerns in the Big Tech industry. While Microsoft has gotten less attention in that respect than fellow tech giants Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google, the deal could put Microsoft back in the spotlight, as it would make the company an even bigger player in the gaming industry.

It is designed to be the successor to its F-22, which along with the F-35, is considered the world’s top fighter jet.\n\nThe NGAD program has similar aims to the joint UK-Japan-Italy plan.\n\n“The Air Force intends for NGAD to replace the F-22 fighter jet beginning in 2030, possibly including a combination of crewed and uncrewed aircraft,” a US Congressional Research document says.\n\nBut as of now the US is pursuing the NGAD program alone.\n\nShared economic interests\n\nThe British, Japanese and Italian leaders highlighted the benefits of working together.\n\n“It will deepen our defense cooperation, science and technology collaboration, integrated supply chains, and further strengthen our defense industrial base,” their joint statement said.\n\nThe program is also expected to provide an economic boost.\n\n“This program will deliver wider economic and industrial benefits, supporting jobs and livelihoods across Japan, Italy and the UK,” the statement said.\n\nThe British statement said a 2021 analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted the new warplane program could support about 21,000 jobs a year by 2050 and contribute an estimated $32.1 billion (£26.2 billion) to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, China and Russia are also thought to be pursuing sixth-generation aircraft.\n\nChina and Russia now fly fifth-generation fighters – Beijing’s J-20 and J-31 jets and Moscow’s Su-57.\n\nBut the US-designed F-35s are widely seen as equal to or better than the Chinese or Russian aircraft.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/politics/fact-check-biden-deficit-reduction/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Deconstructing Biden's claim that 'I reduced the federal ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been taking credit for reducing the federal budget deficit, the annual gap between the money the government takes in and the money the government spends.\n\n“Let me remind you again: I reduced the federal deficit,” Biden said in a speech on Wednesday. “All the talk about the deficit from my Republican friends, I love it. I’ve reduced it $350 billion in my first year in office. And we’re on track to reduce it, by the end of September, by another 1 trillion, 500 billion dollars – the largest drop ever.”\n\nBiden’s figures for both the 2021 fiscal year (which ran through last September) and the ongoing 2022 fiscal year (which runs through the coming September) are accurate, though the $1.5 trillion figure for 2022 is a projection. But some experts on fiscal policy say Biden is distorting reality when he claims that he is personally responsible for the deficit going down.\n\nThe deficit has been smaller under the Biden administration than it was at the end of President Donald Trump’s tenure. But the deficit has been bigger under the Biden administration than the nonpartisan federal Congressional Budget Office had projected it would be if the Biden-era federal government stuck with the laws that were in effect when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\n“The actions of the administration and Congress have undoubtedly resulted in higher deficits, not smaller ones,” Dan White, senior director at Moody’s Analytics – an economic research firm whose analysis Biden has repeatedly touted in his speeches – said in an email. “It is encouraging that the administration has proposed some initiatives to bring down the deficit, but so far none of those initiatives has been seriously considered.”\n\nA smaller deficit than before – but a bigger deficit than expected\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021, during which Biden was in office for more than eight months, was about $360 billion lower than the roughly $3.1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2020, Trump’s last full fiscal year in office.\n\nA $360 billion decline is certainly substantial. The Congressional Budget Office, however, had estimated at the beginning of Biden’s tenure that the fiscal 2021 deficit would be a decline of more than $870 billion if the Biden administration did not implement new policy.\n\nThe Biden administration did implement new policy – notably including a massive pandemic relief package.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization that advocates deficit reduction, said in an interview that Biden’s claims about having personally reduced the deficit are “almost bizarro world,” a reversal of reality. The deficit would have fallen by much more “had President Biden come to office and not done anything,” he said.\n\nIt’s important to note that Congress has the power of the purse in the federal government. Presidents propose budgets, but Congress habitually ignores them in favor of its own spending preferences. So both blame and credit should be shared.\n\nGoldwein said the Biden administration has “a lot of good ideas” for reducing the deficit in the future. But so far, he said, Biden has “done lots of things that have increased deficits” – from signing the pandemic relief package to signing a major bipartisan infrastructure law to boosting food stamp benefits to extending the Trump-era pandemic pause on federal student loan repayments – and has “passed no pieces of legislation to directly reduce deficits.”\n\nExpiring pandemic spending has been the main factor\n\nSo why, then, has the federal deficit gotten smaller at all under Biden, even if it has been higher than was originally projected at the time Biden took office?\n\nThere are a number of factors at play – including the economic rebound for which White, Goldwein and others say Biden can fairly take some credit. But the main factor is that temporary pandemic relief spending has been ending, bringing federal spending down from extraordinarily high levels.\n\nThere was an explosion of short-term spending under Trump after the pandemic hit in 2020. Combined with the reduction in tax revenue largely caused by the pandemic-related economic crash, that temporary spending caused the deficit to skyrocket to an all-time record in fiscal 2020 – the roughly $3.1 trillion that was more than triple the deficit of the year prior.\n\nSo a decline from unprecedented 2020 deficit levels was always very likely. And even a big decline from those 2020 levels doesn’t mean the deficit is low by historical standards.\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 is the second-largest deficit in US history in nominal terms and, according to Goldwein’s organization, the sixth-largest as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. If the fiscal 2022 deficit does end up $1.5 trillion lower than the fiscal 2021 deficit, as Biden correctly noted the Treasury Department now expects, it would still be among the largest ever.\n\nAnd even with a $1.5 trillion decline from fiscal 2021, the fiscal 2022 deficit is still expected to be significantly higher than the deficit the Congressional Budget Office had projected for fiscal 2022 at the time Biden took office. Running a higher-than-expected deficit in fiscal 2021 provided more room for dramatic-sounding deficit reduction in fiscal 2022.\n\nThe quick rebound has helped, too\n\nThe deficit has a spending component and a revenue component. And it would be fair for Biden to boast about putting more revenue in government coffers through economic growth.\n\nBiden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill not only increased government spending but helped fuel an unusually rapid recovery from the 2020 crash – a recovery that generated additional tax payments as well as reducing spending on unemployment benefits in particular.\n\nJoel Friedman, senior vice president for federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, said in an email that the deficit has fallen under Biden in part because pandemic measures have expired but also “because of strong economic growth” Friedman said is “related” to the pandemic measures.\n\nThe “robust” federal pandemic response not only reduced hardship, Friedman said, but “helped make the Covid-19 recession the shortest on record and helped fuel an economic recovery that has brought the unemployment rate down to 3.6 percent and boosted revenue.”\n\nThe deficit did increase under Trump\n\nWhile claiming credit for the deficit falling during his own presidency, Biden has also taken aim at Republicans’ fiscal stewardship – saying in his Wednesday speech that the deficit “went up every year under my predecessor, before the pandemic and during the pandemic.”\n\nThat part is true. Trump’s tax cuts and other policies led to a sharp increase in the deficit even before Covid-19.\n\nThe deficit was $439 billion under President Barack Obama in fiscal 2015 and $587 billion in fiscal 2016, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office. It rose to $666 billion in fiscal 2017, Trump’s first partial fiscal year in office; rose again to $779 billion in fiscal 2018; then rose once more to $984 billion in fiscal 2019 before the pandemic-related tripling in fiscal 2020.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/defense-budget-biden-administration/index.html", "title": "Biden administration proposes larger defense budget to counter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s proposed fiscal year 2023 Pentagon budget includes $813 billion in spending for national defense, a 4% increase of $31 billion from the spending package signed into law earlier this month.\n\nThe Biden administration’s defense budget remains focused on China as the primary strategic challenge, with an emphasis on strengthening European security in light of the threat posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“If you look across the board at their capability, their economy, China remains our most challenging strategic threat. That’s what the strategy says, that’s what the budget says,” a senior defense official told reporters ahead of the budget release.\n\nThe Biden administration’s proposal includes $773 billion in funding specifically for the Pentagon in the coming year. Congress, which will ultimately set spending levels for the federal government, is likely to boost that figure higher, just as it did in the fiscal year 2022 spending package.\n\nRepublicans quickly responded to the Pentagon’s budget rollout by arguing it wasn’t enough for the US military in the face of Russia’s attack on Ukraine and China’s military investments. Liberal Democrats, however, criticized the Biden administration for ramping up the defense budget at all.\n\nWhile the 2023 budget proposal was crafted before Russia invaded Ukraine last month, the Biden administration’s defense budget recognizes the “acute threat” posed by Russia, Defense Department budget documents say. Russia “is pursuing a political, economic and military strategy that seeks to fracture NATO,” the Pentagon said.\n\nThe defense budget includes $6.9 billion in funding for a European Deterrence Initiative intended to counter Russian aggression and support Ukraine – funding that the White House touted in a fact sheet rolling out the entire federal budget proposal on Monday.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2022 spending bill approved last month, Congress passed a $13.6 billion supplemental funding bill to provide security assistance to Ukraine and help resupply the Ukrainians with weapons.\n\nIt’s virtually impossible to estimate how long the war between Russia and Ukraine will last, making it incredibly difficult to know whether the US will provide more in security assistance to Kyiv. The US has added thousands of troops to eastern Europe on temporary deployments to bolster NATO’s eastern flank.\n\n“The hard question is whether this is going to last for a short time or a long time,” the official said. “I would certainly say that it is possible that there will be a supplemental for Ukraine.”\n\nAdditional security assistance bills for Ukraine would also require congressional action. Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord suggested to reporters Monday that an additional supplemental for Ukraine was likely later this year.\n\nModernizing the military\n\nThe US Army’s overall troop levels are poised to drop by 3,000. The US Navy proposes decommissioning 24 ships, including nine littoral combat ships and five cruisers. The embattled littoral combat ships have faced perennial problems, including repeated breakdowns and questions about their limited armament.\n\nThe ships were hailed as part of the US deterrent against China, since they were designed to operate in shallow waters like the South China Sea. But the decomissioning of so many in one year appears to be an acknowledgment that the expensive surface combatants have failed to live up to expectations.\n\nAnd in the air, the Pentagon only plans to purchase 61 F-35 aircraft, compared to the 85 purchased last year. The Air Force is also proposing the retirement of A-10 attack planes and F-22 fighters.\n\nAll of those plans are likely face pushback from Congress, which has repeatedly resisted cutbacks that would hurt weapons suppliers based in their districts or bases and shipyards that could shrink if planes and ships are removed.\n\nThe defense official said that the proposed increased budget wasn’t intended to increase the size of the US military, but rather to help modernize it to compete with Russia and China.\n\nMany of the department’s programs, even if they don’t specifically apply to Russia or China, address the challenges posed by both countries, the official noted. That includes investments like space, cyber and the industrial base.\n\n“The growth in the top line is not about making the force bigger,” the official said. “It’s about modernizing the force to compete with our near-peer adversaries.”\n\nStill, the proposed budget includes $6.1 billion in funding for Pacific deterrence, including to bolster the defense of Guam and for new missile warning and tracking architecture.\n\nThe Pentagon said that its budget “prioritizes China as the preeminent pacing challenge while developing capabilities and operational concepts in the Indo-Pacific.”\n\nInflation posed its own challenge to the Defense Department budget, even as the request was finalized before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fuel prices soaring.\n\n“We did the best that we could given that at some point you have to snap the chalk line and finish with what you know at that time,” said the official. “Inflation going forward, based on Russia’s impact of Ukraine spiking fuel prices – that’s a new variable that will have to be addressed.”\n\nLargest budget for research and procurement\n\nWith an emphasis on modernizing the military, the budget request includes the largest ever investment in procurement, research and development at $276 billion.\n\nThe Defense Department’s focus on building “integrated deterrence” requires modernizing the military across all of the domains of warfare: air, land, sea, cyber and space. The budget requests $56.6 billion for the purchase of F-35 and F-15EX fighter jets while the military develops the B-21 bomber planes and drones.\n\nAt sea, the budget requests $40.8 billion for the construction of eight battle force fleet ships, including nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. The budget request also has $12.6 billion to modernize Army and Marine Corps combat equipment.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, the budget request includes $479 million to implement the recommendations of the Pentagon’s independent review commission on sexual assault, one of the top priorities for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin when he came into the position.\n\nThe budget also would provide a 4.6% pay raise for both military and civilian employees, which the administration touted as the largest pay raise in two decades.\n\nAnd it expands the department’s commitment to prepare for climate change, including a $3.1 billion request for investments designed to “lay the groundwork for a more capable future force.”\n\nThe budget requested also included a $1 billion flexible fund to manage the response to the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. Austin announced in early March that he had made the decision to close the facility after a petroleum leak contaminated the water. About a million people rely on the facility for water.\n\nThe official described the amount as “more than a down payment,” while acknowledging the challenge in predicting exactly how much money will be needed to deal with the facility, especially with ongoing litigation.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Ellie Kaufman Jeremy Herb", "Oren Liebermann", "Ellie Kaufman", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html", "title": "FIRST ON CNN: US left behind $7 billion of military equipment in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nApproximately $7 billion of military equipment the US transferred to the Afghan government over the course of 16 years was left behind in Afghanistan after the US completed its withdrawal from the country in August, according to a congressionally mandated report from the US Department of Defense viewed by CNN.\n\nThis equipment is now in a country that is controlled by the very enemy the US was trying to drive out over the past two decades: the Taliban. The Defense Department has no plans to return to Afghanistan to “retrieve or destroy” the equipment, reads the report, which has been provided to Congress.\n\nThe US gave a total of $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) from 2005 to August 2021, according to the report. Of that total, equipment worth $7.12 billion remained in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal was completed on August 30, 2021. It included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials, according to the DoD report.\n\nThe huge value of the hardware left behind will serve to refocus attention on the chaotic and hasty Afghanistan withdrawal that has been heavily criticized by lawmakers from both parties.\n\n“Much of the remaining equipment” left in Afghanistan requires “specialized maintenance that DoD contractors previously provided” to Afghan forces “in the form of technical knowledge and support,” the report states.\n\nThe Department of Defense was required to submit a report to Congress “regarding the disposition of United States property, equipment and supplies provided to” Afghan forces that “were destroyed, taken out of” or “remain in Afghanistan,” states the report, which is dated March 2022.\n\n“The $7.12 billion figure cited in the Department’s recent report to Congress corresponds to ANDSF equipment and not U.S. military equipment used by our forces,” Army Major Rob Lodewick, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. “Nearly all equipment used by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan was either retrograded or destroyed prior to our withdrawal and is not part of the ‘$7.12 billion’ figure cited in the report.”\n\nFrom Afghanistan to Ukraine\n\nThe report also says that five Mi-17 helicopters that had been in Afghanistan were officially transferred to Ukraine in 2022, though they were already in Ukraine for maintenance before the US left Afghanistan. The Department of Defense notified Congress of its intent to transfer the helicopters in January 2022, before Russia’s invasion of the country had begun, and Ukraine signed a letter of acceptance on March 11, 2022.\n\n“These five helicopters were in Ukraine undergoing overhaul maintenance when the Afghan government collapsed, and have remained there since,” the report states.\n\nOf other materials the US had previously procured for Afghanistan but not sent to the country, the US has given some “non-standard munitions” to Ukraine, including about 37,000 122mm howitzer rounds, the report states.\n\nThe US has also transferred over 15 million rounds of Ball rifle ammunition, over 99,000 40mm high-explosive/fragmentation grenade cartridges, and about 119,000 82mm high-explosive mortar rounds to Ukraine from material that was previously procured for Afghanistan, the report states.\n\nThese munitions have been transferred to Ukraine under presidential drawdown authority, the report states.\n\nUS military equipment and weapons left behind\n\nAircraft worth $923.3 million remained in Afghanistan. The US left 78 aircraft procured for the government of Afghanistan at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul before the end of the withdrawal. These aircraft were demilitarized and rendered inoperable before the US military left, the report states. The US military conducted its non-combatant evacuation from Afghanistan in August, primarily through that airport.\n\nA total of 9,524 air-to-ground munitions, valued at $6.54 million, remained in Afghanistan at the conclusion of the US military withdrawal. The “significant majority” of the “remaining aircraft munitions stock are non-precision munitions,” the report states.\n\nOver 40,000 of the total 96,000 military vehicles the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US withdrawal, including 12,000 military Humvees, the report states. “The operational condition of the remaining vehicles” in Afghanistan is “unknown,” the report states.\n\nMore than 300,000 of the total 427,300 weapons the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US military withdrawal, according to the report. Less than 1,537,000 of the “specialty munitions” and “common small arms ammunition,” valued at a total of $48 million, are still in the country, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” of the communications equipment that the US gave to Afghan forces, including base-station, mobile, man-portable and hand-held commercial and military radio systems, and associated transmitters and encryption devices also remained in Afghanistan at the time of the withdrawal, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” night vision, surveillance, “biometric and positioning equipment” totaling nearly 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment remained in the country, the report adds.\n\nAnd “nearly all,” of the explosive ordinance disposal and demining equipment, including 17,500 “pieces of explosive detection, electronic countermeasure, disposal and personal protective equipment” also remained in Afghanistan, according to the report.", "authors": ["Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/politics/biden-administration-lithium-batteries/index.html", "title": "Biden administration making $3 billion investment in lithium ion ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is building on his electric vehicle goal with a $3 billion investment Monday aimed at boosting the US supply of lithium ion batteries through the bipartisan infrastructure package.\n\nThe move is aimed at fighting climate change, but also to make the US more energy independent and secure, officials said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global oil markets.\n\n“To help make electric vehicles work, we need also to increase the production of lithium ion batteries and we need responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials used to make lithium ion batteries such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite,” infrastructure implementation coordinator and senior Biden adviser Mitch Landrieu told reporters.\n\nLandrieu added, “The bipartisan infrastructure law directs more than $7 billion to strengthen the US battery supply chain that will help us avoid disruptions, lower the cost and accelerate battery production in America to meet this demand. So today, the Department of Energy is announcing $3.16 billion to support battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law.”\n\nBiden previously set a goal of having electric vehicles make up over half of all vehicle sales by 2030. The infrastructure law also includes $7.5 billion for electric vehicle chargers, $5 billion for electric transit buses, $5 billion for clean and electric school buses.\n\nThe funding will help secure the battery supply chain and build capacity, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said, and will also improve US competition.

And that underscores why it’s so important that we in the United States re-invest and re-underwrite our own energy security and building a reliable end-to-end supply chain for batteries and storage and electric vehicle production is among the most important things that we can do to secure that long-term energy security, which ultimately must involve security to a clean energy economy,” Deese said.\n\nIt will help underwrite private investment and “seed dozens of companies across the United States to build capacity in a way that we have not done in decades,” Deese said.\n\nThe $3 billion will go toward producing and recycling critical minerals, without new extraction on mining or sourcing materials for domestic manufacturing.\n\n“We will ensure that the United States is not just a world leader in making batteries, but in innovating the advanced battery technologies that we need in the future, in securing the supply chain so we can be less vulnerable to global supply disruptions, and making this industry sustainable by recycling materials and using cleaner manufacturing processes,” climate adviser Gina McCarthy said.\n\nThe funding will be distributed through federal grants and officials expect to fund up to 30 grants following technical and commercial reviews and evaluation, officials said.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}]}

Quake magnitudes explained.", "text": "The 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck New Jersey Friday generated shaking that could be felt from Washington, D.C. to north of Boston.\n\nAbout 55 earthquakes a day – 20,000 a year – are recorded by the National Earthquake Information Center. Most are tiny and barely noticed by people living where they happen. Click here to see the USDA shake map for the most recent earthquakes.\n\nWorldwide there are on average about 16 major earthquakes in any given year, 15 in the magnitude 7.0 range and one 8.0 or greater, according to records going back to 1900.\n\nThe United States typically has around 63 earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 each year, according to USGS, about five between 6.0 and 6.9 and less than one between 7.0 and 7.9.\n\nA major 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan on Wednesday morning, killing 9 people and injuring over 1,000. The strongest earthquake there in a quarter century was followed by a series of aftershocks, reaching up to 6.4 magnitude.\n\nMore earthquakes are being recorded around the globe, but that doesn’t mean there are more earthquakes happening, according to the US Geological Survey. Instead, it’s because there are more measurement devices, called seismometers that record vibrations, which have been deployed in more places.\n\nEarthquakes are a natural part of life on Earth, a geologically active planet, with seven major tectonic plates. These are continent-sized slabs of rock that glide over the planet’s mantle, constantly but very slowly reshaping the Earth’s landscape.\n\nWhat does magnitude mean in an earthquake?\n\nMagnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. Officially it's called the Moment Magnitude Scale. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each number is ten times as strong as the one before it. So a 5.2 earthquake is moderate while a 6.2 is strong.\n\nThe magnitude and effect of an earthquake, according to Michigan Technological University:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt\n\n2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\n6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can totally destroy communities\n\nIntensity scales, measured in Roman numerals, are used to describe how strong the earthquake felt to people in the area.\n\nAccording to the California Earthquake Authority, an intensity of I is typically felt only under especially favorable conditions. A IV, which leads to light shaking, is felt indoors by many, but not typically outdoors. It might awaken some people at night and lead to a senation like a truck striking a building. A parked car would rock. Intensities VI and above would be strong, frightening and felt by all, with the damage increasing up to a X where the shaking would be violent. Some well-built wooden structures would be destroyed and most masonry and frame structures along with their foundations would be ruined.\n\nWhile you might have heard the term \"the Richter Scale\" used to describe earthquakes, it is no longer commonly used because it was only valid for certain earthquake frequencies and distance ranges.\n\nWhy does an earthquake's depth matter?\n\nMagnitude measures how strong a quake is. That said, how much the ground shakes depends on an earthquake's intensity, which in turn depends on two things: how far away the actual site of the temblor was and what kind of soil it occurs in.\n\nThis is why an earthquake's depth is often given. The epicenter of the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994 was in the San Fernando Valley, the point where the quake was strongest. But the hypocenter, the location where the quake actually occurred, was more than 11 miles underground. If it had been closer to the surface the 6.7 magnitude quake would have been even more devastating.\n\nThe type of ground matters too. Bedrock shakes least, sand and gravel as much as two times more and mud and landfill as much as five times more, a major factor in why some areas of San Francisco suffered more than others in the Loma Prieta quake of 1989.\n\nWhy real earthquakes aren't like in the movies\n\nThough movies like San Andreas and Earthquake show enormous entire coastlines dropping off into the ocean, it's not going to happen.\n\nAccording to the US Geological Service, while a \"mega-quake with a magnitude of 10 or larger is theoretically possible, it's very unlikely.\n\nThe magnitude of an earthquake magnitude depends in part on how long the geological fault it occurs on is. Longer faults result in stronger earthquakes.\n\nThere are no known faults capable of generating a magnitude 10 or larger. The San Andreas fault of movie fame couldn't produce a quake larger than about 8.3 given its length, according to USGS.\n\nThe largest earthquake in US history was the 1964 Good Friday quake in Alaska, a 9.2 magnitude quake which killed 131 people. It lasted four and a half minutes and ran along the Aleutian fault.\n\nWhat's the chance of an aftershock?\n\nAny time there's an earthquake, one concern is that it was merely a foreshock to a bigger quake that's coming.\n\nGlobally, the probability one earthquake will be followed by a large earthquake within 3 days is somewhere just over 6%, according to USGS.\n\nThat means whenever there's an earthquake, there's about a 94% chance that it wasn't a foreshock and there won't be any more quakes linked to it.\n\nThe numbers are a little different for California, which is very seismically active. There, about half of the biggest earthquakes were preceded by foreshocks, according to USGS. But that means half were not.\n\nUnfortunately, it's impossible to know if any one quake is a foreshock.\n\nAftershocks are defined as smaller earthquakes that happen in days after a larger quake. As USGS puts it, they represent \"minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the mainshock.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/asia/japan-earthquake-fukushima-intl/index.html", "title": "Japan earthquake: 4 dead after 7.4-magnitude quake hits coast off ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nA 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Japan late Wednesday night, killing at least four people and injuring over 100 others, and cutting power to millions of homes.\n\nOne of the people who died was a man in his 60s who lived in the city of Soma, the local disaster prevention office said on Thursday.\n\nThe quake hit off the coast of Japan’s eastern Fukushima prefecture, a region devastated by a powerful quake and tsunami 11 years ago that resulted in a nuclear power plant meltdown.\n\nThe quake was originally designated 7.3-magnitude, but was upgraded to 7.4 on Thursday.\n\nA tsunami advisory was issued after Wednesday’s quake for the coastal prefectures of Fukushima and Miyagi, but was lifted on Thursday morning and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later said “no abnormalities” had been detected at any of the country’s nuclear plants.\n\nThe quake had a preliminary epicenter depth of 60 kilometers (37 miles), said Japan’s Meteorological Agency.

The epicentre of the second earthquake was around 80 miles north of Gaziantep in the Elbistan district of Turkey’s Kahramanmaras province.\n\nOfficials said this was a separate earthquake itself, not an aftershock, although there have already been at least 40 subsequent tremors.\n\nThe first earthquake struck at a depth of about 17.9km (11 miles) about 20 miles from Gaziantep, which is home to about 2 million people, the US Geological Survey said. The region also hosts millions of Syrian refugees, and is the site of one of the largest operations run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThe Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said ten cities had been affected: Gaziantep, Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Osmaniye, Adıyaman, Malatya, Şanlıurfa, Adana, Diyarbakır and Kilis.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn Syria, areas densely populated by refugees from the country’s civil war have been badly affected. In a statement, the White Helmets, the Western-funded civilian rescue service in the country, described “a catastrophic situation with buildings collapsed or suffering major cracks, hundreds injured and stranded, dozens dead and a lack of services as well as safe shelters and assembly points in stormy and snowy weather conditions and low temperatures”.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nTurkey’s emergency management agency, AFAD, has said it is deploying 1,898 search and rescue workers and 150 vehicles. The Gendarmerie Special Security Command has sent a crew of 130 with mobile command centres and kitchens to Kahramanmaras, according to The New York Times. A total of 300,000 blankets have also been sent to the region, which has been experiencing winter storms and where daytime temperatures are currently around 3C.\n\nThe airport in Gaziantep was on Monday morning only allowing planes carrying emergency aid to land, while all train services were suspended nationwide in Syria as the government declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn Syria, the White Helmets have called for aid from the international community “to prevent the situation from worsening”. It aims to pressure the Russian-backed Syrian government to hold back on airstrikes in the area, where buildings were particularly vulnerable due to previous conflict damage.\n\nExperts have long warned that a large earthquake could devastate Istanbul, said The Guardian. Turkey, which lies over the Anatolian fault line, is in one of the world’s most active earthquake zones.

Hualien is a popular tourist destination 100 miles south of Taipei, where buildings swayed and some damage was reported. A series of aftershocks followed, reaching up to 6.4 magnitude.\n\nSome buildings tumbled or were leaning precariously while scores of people were trapped inside the damaged structures.

Then getting to those that you’ve located that are deeply entombed can require a Herculean effort with multidisciplinary teams,\" Barbera told USA TODAY.\n\nThe death toll may rise some in the coming days as search teams sift through collapsed structures, Barbera said.\n\nIn Hualien, the city's mayor, Hsu Chen-Wei, said by the end of the day everyone in buildings there that are considered dangerous had been evacuated and demolition had begun on four.\n\nThe White House said Wednesday morning that it is monitoring the impacts from the earthquake on Taiwan and Japan. \"The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance.

Emergency services are prepared for quake rescue and recovery. The densely populated island nation is also exceptionally well prepared for earthquakes, Barbera said, which makes the damage from Wednesday's quake potentially much less than it would be otherwise.\n\nTaiwan is a \"model\" for its seismic building codes and strict enforcement of them, he said. Critical buildings that need to function in emergencies are built on a foundation that allows for it to roll during a quake, he said. Taipei 101, a skyscraper that once held the title of tallest building in the world, features a famous tuned mass damper, essentially a massive pendulum that sways during an earthquake to counteract and limit any swaying of the building.\n\n\"There's a dramatic difference between building failures – structural failures, not just buildings – in Taiwan versus other other countries that have similar size earthquakes,\" Barbera said. \"They’ve had a true commitment for decades to risk reduction.\"\n\n'We are frightened. We are so nervous.'\n\nLinda Chen, 48, said her apartment in downtown Hualien city had been so badly damaged in an earlier earthquake in 2018 that she had to move. But her new apartment block was damaged, too, in the latest earthquake.\n\n\"We worry the house could collapse anytime. We thought we had already experienced it once in Hualien and it would not hit us again, because God has to be fair,\" she said.\n\n\"We are frightened. We are so nervous.\"\n\n− Reuters\n\nAftershocks near epicenter could continue for days\n\nAt least 29 aftershocks above a 4.9 magnitude have rumbled near the city of Hualien on Wednesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Dozens more have been clocked by Taiwan's Central Weather Administration.\n\nWu Chien-fu, director of Taiwan’s Seismology Center, said aftershocks reaching 7.0 could shake the nation of 23 million people for three or four more days. Over a dozen aftershocks on Wednesday were greater than 5.0 in magnitude, and one was over 6.0, USGS data shows.\n\nAftershocks are a sequence of smaller quakes that are a part of the \"readjustment process\" along a fault line where a main shock took place, the USGS said. They can continue for days, weeks, months or even years after a large earthquake, and their frequency usually decreases with time.\n\nDozens rescued from tunnels where they were trapped\n\nOver 70 people have been evacuated from tunnels near Hualien City, fire authorities said. Video published by Taiwan National Fire Agency shows responders conducting search-and-rescue operations underneath collapsed buildings.\n\nThe rescued people include two German nationals.\n\nWhere did the earthquake strike?\n\nThe earthquake’s epicenter was 6 miles northeast of the small town of Hualien City.\n\nThe area is known by some as “the Hawaii of Taiwan” because of its warm, tropical weather, lush greenery and crystal clear ocean waters. In addition, it’s home to the Taroko Gorge, a stunning natural granite gorge with transparent turquoise and dark blue water that is a destination for hikers.\n\nSigns along the pathways and hiking trails in the gorge warn visitors of possible falling rocks. Five-star hotels in the town of Hualien and in the vicinity of Taroko National Park where the gorge is located cater to tourists from around the globe coming to see and hike the area.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nVideos show dramatic moments when earthquake hit\n\nSocial media videos showed rescuers using ladders to help trapped people out of windows. Buildings could be seen collapsing onto streets as landslides swept across roads and highways. Bridges swayed and items on shelves splattered onto the ground. Some damage was reported to the Taipei subway system, which closed briefly before resuming partial service.\n\n\"At present the most important thing, the top priority, is to rescue people,\" said President-elect Lai Ching-te, speaking outside one of collapsed buildings in Hualien.\n\nRescue and recovery efforts underway\n\nThe quake shook Taipei, knocking out power in several parts of the city. Elsewhere, authorities said they had lost contact with 50 travelers aboard four minibuses heading to a hotel in a national park, Taroko Gorge.\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the military will be deployed to help with rescue and recovery operations. She pledged that federal and local governments would cooperate with each other to \"minimize the impact of the disasters.\"\n\nShallow quake was close to land\n\nWu said the quake's epicenter was very shallow and close to land, the result of movement in the Philippine Sea Plate. He said it felt strong in Taipei because of the “basin effect,” which occurs when earthquake reverberations become trapped in soft ground.\n\nThe quake was Taiwan's largest since the 1999 Jiji earthquake that killed over 2,400 people and injured 11,300 more.\n\nNuclear power stations unaffected\n\nMost power has been restored after the quake, electricity utility Taipower said, with the island's two nuclear power stations unaffected.\n\nTaiwan's high-speed rail operator said no damage or injuries were reported on its trains, although services would be delayed as it made inspections.\n\nA major supplier of chips to Apple and Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it had evacuated some fabrication plants and safety systems were operating normally. Nvidia said it expects no supply disruptions from the earthquake.\n\nIt said later its workers were safe and had returned to their workplaces shortly after the earthquake, adding that impacted facilities were expected to resume production during the night.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}]}

The event, called “Crossover at Kinnick,\" will easily break the world basketball attendance record.\n\nCoach Lisa Bluder acknowledged at Wednesday's media day that receiving so much attention can be overwhelming.\n\n“I’ve stolen this quote from Billie Jean King many times,” Bluder said, “and, in fact, I’m reading the book right now, ‘Pressure Is a Privilege.’ So I think we have to remember that we’re in this situation of facing pressure because we’ve done well. Let’s enjoy that. Let’s rejoice about that.”\n\nFOLLOW THE MADNESS: NCAA women's basketball scores, schedules, teams and more.\n\nIowa finished 31-7 last season after its 102-85 loss to LSU in the NCAA championship game, which drew an average of 9 million TV viewers.\n\nThe Hawkeyes return a veteran core of national player of the year in fourth-year guard Caitlin Clark, fifth-year guard Gabbie Marshall and sixth-year guard Kate Martin. The big losses to graduation were center Monika Czinano and guard-forward McKenna Warnock.\n\nClark begins the season 810 points from Kelsey Plum's NCAA record scoring total of 3,527, set when she played for Washington from 2013-17.\n\n“It's not something I’m counting down the numbers to at all,” Clark said, “and if I never get there, that’ll be fine. But I know it’s a possibility for me this year.”\n\nClark, of course, is largely responsible for the ticket sales spike this season. Fans have marveled at her 3-point shooting from extreme distances since she was a freshman, but she also is a flashy passer and excellent rebounder.\n\nShe had 41 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in the regional final win over Louisville for the first 40-point triple double in either the men's or women's NCAA tournaments. She followed that with a 41-point game against South Carolina in the Final Four before scoring 30 in the loss to LSU.\n\nThe title game was also part of the national conversation for weeks because of LSU star Angel Reese’s taunting of the showstopping Clark as the Tigers’ victory became imminent.\n\nReese waved her hand over her own face in a gesture known as “you can't see me,” popularized by professional wrestler John Cena. Clark had made the same gesture in the regional final against Louisville. Reese also displayed her ring finger to Clark to indicate that's where she would be wearing her championship ring.\n\nReese, who is Black, faced some criticism for her gestures and Clark, who is white, generally did not. The dynamic of race was part of the discussion.\n\nClark, who defended Reese after the tournament, didn't want to revisit the incident during an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMartin, her teammate, said the team did not like how the situation was portrayed.\n\n“Basketball is a competitive game,” she said. “Things get heated on the court. You see that in men's basketball all the time. Yeah, we got a lot of attention out of it. Is all attention great attention? I don't know if it's all positive, but we did gain a lot of fans and gained a lot of momentum from that. There's no bad blood between us and LSU. We're competitors and you have to move on.”\n\n___\n\nAP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/sport/katie-taylor-amanda-serrano-madison-square-garden-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano set to make boxing history | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time in its 140-year history, two female boxers are headlining at Madison Square Garden as undisputed lightweight champion Katie Taylor goes toe-to-toe with seven-weight champion Amanda Serrano in the ring on Saturday.\n\n“I think this is one of those history making fights. Male or female, the sport hasn’t seen a fight like this before,” the 35-year-old Taylor told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell.\n\n“I feel like after Saturday night, people are going to be talking about myself and Amanda Serrano in years and years to come.”\n\nThe ‘World’s Most Famous Arena’ will be a fitting venue for a battle between the best in the world; both ESPN and DAZN have Taylor ranked first and Serrano second pound-for-pound.\n\nThis will be the boxing’s first fight between the pound-for-pound No. 1 and No. 2 since 2008, when Manny Pacquiao defeated Juan Manuel Marquez. The fight will be televised exclusively by DAZN starting at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nA 2012 Olympic gold medalist, Taylor (20-0, 6 knockouts) is putting her lightweight titles in the WBA, IBF, WBO, WBC and The Ring on the line. The 33-year-old Serrano (42-1-1, 30 knockouts), has earned world titles across seven weight classes ranging from 115 to 140 pounds. Last year, she successfully defended her WBO and WBC featherweight titles.\n\n“We’re two great champions in our prime and it’s going to make for such an amazing fight,” said Taylor. “I think stylistically we might do very, very well together. She’s obviously a very, very aggressive fighter and so am I. So, I think it’s going to be a very, very exciting fight.

When the time came to reschedule both Taylor and Serrano decided to fight for a bigger payday, delaying the match even further.\n\n“You obviously know your worth when you are capable of selling out arenas and selling out stadiums. We’re both in a position where we’re able to do it, and not just sell out a stadium but sell out Madison Square Garden, which is very, very special,” said Taylor.\n\nTaylor and Serrano stand for a photo prior to the kick off of fight week, on top of the Empire State Building in New York City on April 26, 2022.

In 2021, Puerto Rican Serrano, who lives in Brooklyn, signed with Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which is co-promoting the fight with Matchroom Sport.\n\nA long-time pioneer in the sport, securing her own payday isn’t enough for Taylor – she wants her success to start spreading throughout the rest of women’s boxing.\n\n“I feel like we have covered a lot of ground over the last few years in terms of the paycheck and the purses, but I still feel like we still have a long way to go as well,” she told CNN.\n\n“It’s not okay that myself and Amanda are just the ones that are getting the big paychecks, but that has to carry over onto the other female fighters as well and I hope that can happen.”\n\nTaylor, left, and Firuza Sharipova fight during thei undisputed ightweight championship bout at M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool, England.

Since going pro in 2016, Taylor has seen huge changes in her sport.\n\n“When I first turned pro six years ago, it was very, very unusual to see a female fight on a card, but right now you’re seeing female fights in every single boxing card and you’re seeing the female fighters as household names as well, which is absolutely incredible,” said Taylor.\n\n“I think for the first time, people are actually seeing the best in women’s boxing. They’re seeing the best versus the best and just the skill that actually involves.”\n\nTaylor is pictured during a public workout prior to Saturday's fight against Serrano.

Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nGrowing up, Taylor looked to Christy Martin and Deidre Gogarty for representation in the ring. Now, being at the forefront of her sport, Taylor recognizes that she is a source of inspiration for young female boxers.\n\n“It is definitely a big responsibility, it’s also just more like a privilege to me. You want to have this influence and influence is an absolute privilege. I feel very, very lucky and blessed to be in this position.” said Taylor, who grow up in Bray, near Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n“When I started boxing as a 10 or 11 year-old, there was no female fighters at all in the country and when I walk into every single boxing gym right now in Ireland, every single gym is packed with female fighters; and the talent that I’m seeing, they’re absolute superstars in the making.

Their rising superstardom captivated the nation in the NCAA Tournament, breaking a record for television viewership and setting the stage for explosive growth in the men’s game before moving on to save the NBA.\n\nThis year, it’s Caitlin Clark of Iowa. She is also helping set new viewership records in the women’s game and could similarly bring new life to the WNBA this year after this weekend’s Final Four in Cleveland.\n\nFOLLOW THE MADNESS: NCAA basketball bracket, scores, schedules, teams and more.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has noticed.\n\n“This is our Magic-Bird moment,” she told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday.\n\nFormer CBS Sports president Neal Pilson attended that game in '79 and sees parallels, too.\n\n“Larry Bird and Magic − can that be replicated?” Pilson told USA TODAY Sports. “I’m not at all concerned that there won’t be a positive continuation of this type of attention… All this feeds on itself. It grows. It doesn’t just go away.”\n\nCaitlin Clark and exposure\n\nIt’s not a perfect comparison. Magic vs. Bird exploded into a two-star college rivalry that culminated in the championship game. This year, Clark and Iowa beat defending champion LSU and rival star Angel Reese in the Elite Eight, drawing the biggest television audience in women’s college basketball history (12.3 million). Four days later, Clark plays in the Final Four Friday against Connecticut and Paige Bueckers, a guard her coach has described as “the best player in America.”\n\nBut the high-wattage appeal is similarly stirring to viewers, advertisers and even gamblers, helping the popularity “feed off itself” by raising the tide of exposure for all boats that benefit from it.\n\nIn 1979, Magic vs. Bird set a record with 35 million viewers. Now evidence shows a similar sort of national awakening in women’s basketball.\n\n“I’ve been analogizing that to say this is our transformational moment like that was, which led to big media deals, with led to big marketing, i.e. Michael Jordan and Nike, the ultimate marketer,” Engelbert said.\n\nYet the women’s college game has had big audiences and stars before, in the 1980s and ‘90s, including Cheryl Miller and Sheryl Swoopes. Their tournament games also drew audiences of seven to 12 million on CBS when there were far fewer media channels and no social media. Huge growth didn’t follow.\n\n“The question for me more is, `How sustainable is this?’” said Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue who has co-authored a study on media coverage of women’s sports. “Is this another peak that’s going to be followed by a valley? Or is this truly sort of an upward trajectory where we see increases happening over time?”\n\nThis time might be different\n\nFor example:\n\n◾ Two of the top four most-watched women’s college basketball games of all time featured Clark against Reese – last year in the final game (nearly 10 million on average) and Monday in the Elite Eight (12.3 million).\n\n◾ Forty new advertisers are buying time in the women’s Final Four this weekend with ABC or ESPN. The Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC and ESPN, confirmed to USA TODAY Sports that inventory for those games sold out earlier than ever before. Disney also confirmed that revenue from those sales more than doubled from last year and has more than tripled over the past three years.\n\n◾ GroupM, a prominent media investment group, announced last week a commitment to double investment in annual women’s sports advertising. It plans to do it with clients such as Adidas, Ally, Coinbase, Discover, Google, Mars, Nationwide, Unilever and Universal Pictures.\n\nThe company cited peaks in viewership and said it would collaborate with media partners to help “drive the discovery, promotion and monetization of women’s sports.“\n\n◾ Gambling, which helps drive sports viewership, is also skyrocketing for women’s basketball and wasn't even legal in most of the nation until after May 2018. The betting handle on women’s college basketball is up 14 times more than last year as of March, according to DraftKings. The LSU-Iowa game Monday was the most bet-on women’s college basketball game in DraftKings Sportsbook history and was on par with many NFL games from last season in terms of betting handle.\n\n“When you treat us like a sport, you will get a return on your investment,” said South Carolina coach Dawn Staley, whose undefeated team faces North Carolina State in the other national semifinal Friday. “Women's basketball is in high demand. People want to see it. People want to see it live, and people want to see it across the airways.”\n\n'50 years in the making'\n\nIn other words, exposure and investment are peaking for women’s college basketball after decades of under-investment, neglect and occasional fits and starts.\n\nBy comparison, the men’s game has reaped the benefits of exposure and investment for decades longer. And it wasn’t until 1972 that Title IX banned sex discrimination in schools.\n\nThe first NCAA Tournament for the men came in 1939, compared to 1982 for the women, who previously competed for championships in the now-defunct Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. By 1954, the men got their first national championship game on national TV, compared to 1982 for the women.\n\n“Remember, we just celebrated the 50th anniversary of Title IX,” said former Georgia Tech coach Bernadette McGlade, now the commissioner of the Atlantic 10 Conference. “This has been 50 years in the making. It hasn’t been a flash in the pan just overnight.”\n\nIt still might seem like it sometimes. In 2019, the proportion of airtime devoted to women’s sports on sports news shows and ESPN’s SportsCenter was less than 6%, according to a study by the University of Southern California and Purdue. In 2021, a report commissioned by the NCAA found that the governing body of college sports “prioritizes men’s basketball” and it was \"significantly undervaluing women’s basketball as an asset.\"\n\nThe NCAA didn’t even use the popular marketing term “March Madness” to promote the women’s game until 2022.\n\nSo what’s changing?\n\nFor starters, it helps to not keep under-promoting half of the potential marketplace by gender.\n\n“Their superstars were not getting the kind of promotion they are getting today,” Pilson told USA TODAY Sports. “They and the industry have learned a lot from the NBA and NFL (which have been around longer). They’ve learned that the public responds to the athletes. They learned that the athletes are the shooting stars in their sport.”\n\nThe rise of social media and online streaming services also allowed women’s basketball to reach more people, as opposed to 30 years ago, when newspaper and TV companies essentially acted as gatekeepers of what sports got covered and what didn’t.\n\nSports editors and TV executives back then had limited space and time for coverage, forcing them to make choices. And they would try to justify the coverage disparity between men's and women’s basketball by pointing to the attendance figures. For example, in 1994, the Division I men’s game drew an average of about 5,500 compared to about 1,100 for the women, according to NCAA records.\n\nBut the reverse also could be true: Attendance lagged because the game wasn’t promoted like the men. Similarly, players on the great Tennessee and UConn teams of the 1990s and early 2000s might have gotten more national traction if TikTok, Instagram and other social media were around to connect them with more fans back then.\n\nEndorsement deals help, too. They weren’t allowed for college players until 2021, but now they help brighten the spotlight for some star players, such as Clark with Nike and State Farm insurance.\n\nBut will it last?\n\nThis is where the Magic-Bird comparison faces its moment of truth. After Clark, will the women’s college game sustain this level of interest?\n\nThe men’s game exploded in popularity after Magic and Bird in the 1980s, especially after CBS won the television rights to the men’s tournament in 1982. Other stars and storylines came along to drive interest, pumping up the men’s postseason into the commercial behemoth it is now.\n\nWith Clark on the way to the WNBA, Bueckers and others are left to help carry it, including Southern California’s JuJu Watkins, a freshman who ranked second nationally in scoring this season behind Clark with 27.1 points per game.\n\nThe NCAA also has invested more but still needs to do more, according to supporters of the women’s game.\n\nIn the last three years, the NCAA has increased the investment in just some of the major championship areas for women’s basketball by more than $14 million annually, said Lynn Holzman, the NCAA’s vice president of women’s basketball.\n\nThe Final Four starts Friday in prime time on ESPN, starting with South Carolina (36-0) against North Carolina State (31-6). Iowa (33-4) vs. UConn (33-5) follows.\n\n“It is an event and a place that people want to be because of the historic performances that we are seeing by these individuals and these teams,” Holzman said. “So it's awesome. It's wonderful.”\n\nContributing: Steve Berkowitz\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAthletes, perhaps more than anyone else, make decisions about their bodies every single day in order to perform their best. They choose how and where to train, who to train with, what to eat and what to wear for optimal performance. They have to time these decisions perfectly, as their seasons – and careers – are relatively short, with competition schedules that are not of their own making.\n\nAmy Bass Courtesy Rodney Bedsole\n\nSo, it is no accident that athletes were among the most outspoken advocates for the preservation of Roe v. Wade when Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization hit the Supreme Court last fall. Over 500 of them filed an amicus brief that argued why and how they were united in the “deeply-held belief” that reproductive justice supported the opportunities provided by Title IX, without which “women’s athletics could not have reached its current level of participation and success.”\n\n“Without Roe’s constitutional protection of women’s bodily integrity,” the brief read, “…women would not have been able to take advantage of Title IX and achieve the tremendous level of athletic participation and success that they enjoy today.”\n\nThe brief included the story of Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Crissy Perham, who detailed (for the first time publicly) her experience with an unintended pregnancy while at the University of Arizona. Following the termination of that pregnancy, Perham explained, she refocused her training, won her first national title, and went on to make the US Olympic team, taking home three medals from Barcelona.\n\nAlongside other luminaries who signed on – including Becky Sauerbrunn, captain of the US women’s national soccer team (USWNT), and WNBA stars Diana Taurasi, Breanna Stewart and Brittney Griner (whose plight in Russia is ongoing) – was the always out-in-front soccer star Megan Rapinoe, who was also one of the first to react when the Dobbs decision came down last week. Her fiancé, basketball legend Sue Bird, tweeted simply “Gutted.”\n\nRapinoe, also one of the first athletes to take a knee on the field in support of Colin Kaepernick (and yes, SCOTUS also issued an opinion about taking a knee on the field, but that’s for another day, as America is really churning out the extra right now), took center stage at a USWNT presser. While not scheduled to speak that day, Rapinoe held her own court, just as Golden State Warriors’ coach Steve Kerr had done last month after the massacre in Uvalde.\n\n“I think cruelty is the point,” she summarized through tears. She wasn’t alone. The National Women’s Soccer League (the professional league in which many of the USWNT players compete) issued a fiery statement in reaction to the Court’s decision, as did many of its individual teams, with everyone from the Orlando Reign to Angel City FC speaking out. Gotham FC left little doubt as to where it stood – “reproductive rights are human rights” – while Racing Louisville pointed out that “Kentuckians requiring an abortion will be forced to drive an average of 245 miles for proper healthcare.”\n\nThe NCAA, an organization impacted at every level for the last 50 years by Title IX, and an organization that often seems to be at odds with it, will now oversee teams in states with little to no access to reproductive health resources. In states where abortion is or will be banned, pregnancy rates among college students will, unquestionably, rise, with Title IX their best hope of securing academic accommodations for reproductive healthcare – particularly if they decide to cross state lines to seek an abortion.\n\nStarting now, the life of a student-athlete in California looks far different from one playing for any team in the Southeastern Conference, whose 14 schools are nearly all in states where abortion is (or will be soon) banned or severely restricted. Access to abortion is now something young women will likely have to consider before saying “yes” to a scholarship that could be the next step in their elite careers. With its decision, then, the Supreme Court has ensured that sports are not just a window through which to understand these things: athletes are among the core stakeholders.\n\nThey are also among the most politically visible. While the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces hit the practice court wearing shirts that said “Bans off our Bodies” and “Our bodies, our futures, our abortions,” the league – among the most progressive in the world of sport – issued a statement with the NBA denouncing the Dobbs ruling: “The NBA and WNBA believe that women should be able to make their own decisions concerning their health and future, and we believe that freedom should be protected,” stated commissioners Cathy Engelbert and Adam Silver. “We will continue to advocate for gender and health equity, including ensuring our employees have access to reproductive health care, regardless of their location.”\n\nRapinoe wants more noise, especially from her male counterparts, although some, like LeBron James and football’s Nick Sundberg, already have offered powerful reactions to Dobbs. “You’ve been silent to us,” she said to those who have yet to speak. “Stand up. Say something. This is your wife, this is your sister, this is your friend, this is your girlfriend, this is the mother of your children. This is all of us.”\n\nThe history of Title IX is instructive here, because sport was never intended to be at the center of legislation aimed at recognizing gender equity in education as a civil right – athletes were never mentioned in the path to President Richard Nixon signing the Educational Amendments Act on June 23, 1972. But sometimes the mythical belief in the level playing fields of sport (may the best man win!) work to our advantage. Inequity in athletic departments, from elementary schools to universities, was fairly easy to sniff out, if not fix.\n\nAt its core, Title IX tries to legislate equality, and whether or not that is wholly effective remains to be seen. It is still, without question, a work in progress, giving us as much to critique as celebrate. According to the Women’s Sports Foundation, Title IX disproportionately benefits girls at predominantly White secondary schools.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe Biden administration is looking to expand protections for LGBTQ athletes, while women as coaches and managers remain few and far between. And the bottom line reality remains that there are still far more boys engaged in school sports than girls. But the very existence of Title IX, codified as law, is something to celebrate, giving us something to work with, something to improve, something to negotiate with.\n\nTitle IX, in short, gives us a sense of what is possible in the future in sport, a future that athletes are walking into without reproductive freedom, reproductive justice.\n\nAbortion access, it seems, is one of the few things Americans, not just athletes, largely agree on – polls indicate a majority of US adults say it should be legal in all or most cases. And yet – just a handful of hours after America patted itself on the back in celebration of the 50 years in which just 37 words in a federal educational reform law created dynasties like the USWNT’s four Women’s World Cup titles, golden duos like beach volleyball’s Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, GOATs like Serena Williams and pathbreakers like Allyson Felix, who exposed Nike for its shameful maternity policies despite its female-positive ad campaigns (and exacted change in the process) – the highest court in the land decided that all of them, all of us, are second-class citizens.", "authors": ["Amy Bass"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/us/wnba-draft-ameshya-williams-holliday-cec/index.html", "title": "Ameshya Williams-Holliday: WNBA drafts its first player from an ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNo player from a historically Black college or university has been drafted into the WNBA since 2002.

The last 10 months have been a battle at every turn,” she wrote in her post. “I dug deep to keep my faith and it was the love from so many of you that helped keep me going. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for your help.”\n\nBrittney Griner embraces her wife, Cherelle Griner, upon her return to the US from Russia last Friday. Miguel Negron/US Army South\n\nGriner, 32, said she was “grateful to each person who advocated for me” and thanked the staff at the Texas military facility she briefly called home. She also remembered another foreign prisoner in Russia whose release could not be secured in the prisoner swap that secured her freedom.\n\n“President Biden, you brought me home and I know you are committed to bringing Paul Whelan and all Americans home too,” she said. “I will use my platform to do whatever I can to help you. I also encourage everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home. Every family deserves to be whole.”\n\nGriner plans to return to WNBA’s Mercury\n\nGriner took off from San Antonio around 11 a.m. on Friday, CNN confirmed via her agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas.\n\nAs she boarded the plane, Griner was greeted by Phoenix Mercury GM Jim Pitman, team president Vince Kozar and teammate Diana Taurasi. They made a surprise appearance to welcome her home.\n\nGriner was headed back to Arizona, though her representatives would not confirm exactly where, citing security concerns. CNN previously reported that Griner and her wife, Cherelle, had already made plans to move upon her return to the United States.\n\n“I also want to make one thing very clear: I intend to play basketball for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury this season, and in doing so, I look forward to being able to say ‘thank you’ to those of you who advocated, wrote, and posted for me in person soon,” Griner said.\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medalist was released last week in a prisoner swap after nearly 300 days in Russian custody.\n\nHer detention, after Russian officials found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, became an international cause during a tense time in relations between Washington and Moscow. US officials deemed it a wrongful detention.\n\nShe had traveled to Russia to play basketball in the WNBA offseason and was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region on February 17.\n\nDespite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil in her luggage, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nA delicate diplomatic dance between US and Russia\n\nThe Mercury center became a pawn in Russia’s war in Ukraine and returned to the US on December 9 after the prisoner swap for notorious convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nFor months, a delicate diplomatic dance played out between the US and Russia, which waged war in Ukraine. The US enacted sanctions in response to the conflict while diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations.”\n\nIn a scene out of a spy thriller, the one-for-one prisoner swap occurred on a tarmac in Abu Dhabi on December 8.\n\nOnce on US soil, one of Griner’s first moves was a dunk on a Texas basketball court, according to Colas.\n\nShe donned a pair of black Chuck Taylor shoes, Phoenix Suns shorts and a T-shirt touting Title IX as she returned to the court after a long hiatus. Months ago, in pre-trial detention in Russia, Griner was offered a basketball and a hoop but declined to play, Colas said.\n\nGriner also got a haircut to clean up what family and friends jokingly called her “Russian fade.” Her long, signature dreadlocks were cut while in captivity as she continuously battled the flu because her wet hair kept freezing, according to Colas.\n\nA bittersweet return\n\nStill, her return has been somewhat bittersweet. Griner is heartbroken that Whelan is still detained, her agent said.\n\nWhelan is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who is imprisoned in a Russian penal colony after he was arrested in December 2018 on espionage charges, which he has denied. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nLike Griner, Whelan has been declared wrongfully detained by US officials.\n\nGriner is eager to use her power and influence to help others, especially Whelan, according to her agent.\n\n“She is thinking about his family and talked about her intention to call them as soon as she gets home,” Colas told CNN. “She’s really committed to telling this story and making sure that this population of wrongfully detained Americans, that people know their names.”\n\nGriner stayed at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio for a week for routine evaluation. She stayed with her wife in a residential facility on the base. A Christmas tree decorated their living space.\n\n“I appreciate the time and care to make sure I was okay and equipped with the tools for this new journey,” she wrote on Instagram, referring to staff at the San Antonio base.\n\nHer arrest and conviction brought attention to the plight of other Americans in Russian custody, including Whelan and Trevor Reed.\n\nWhelan’s release could not be secured in the latest prisoner swap, while Reed returned to the US in April after a nearly three-year ordeal.\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\nIn multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nHer flight to Arizona Friday is just one more step in her reintegration.\n\nShe opted into the Department of Defense’s post-isolation program, which other wrongfully detained Americans, including Reed, have participated in, according to Colas. The program focuses on helping formerly captive people regain a sense of control over their lives after lengthy detentions.", "authors": ["Abphillip Ray Sanchez", "Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}]}

With this, Floridians have the chance to essentially vote on whether to reinstate what was once the federal standard set by Roe v.

Wade. But abortion rights advocates are fighting in state court for orders blocking those restrictions.\n\nBoth Louisiana’s so-called trigger ban – which outlawed the procedure outright, with no exemptions for rape or incest – as well as a Georgia ban for abortions after about six weeks into the pregnancy are currently in force. Providers have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to reinstate a judge’s order blocking that ban, after an appeals court suspended it and revived the prohibition. A judge in Atlanta, meanwhile, will consider on Monday whether to temporarily halt the enforcement of the six-week ban while the next steps in the legal challenge proceed.\n\n“Georgia – Atlanta, Georgia, specifically – was a hub for abortion access for people across the southeast,” said Jalessah Jackson, the interim executive director of Access Reproductive Care-Southeast, an abortion fund that provides financial support for abortion-seekers in several southern states.\n\n“Georgia was really that space where people could come and have options for where they want to have their abortion,” Jackson told CNN. “And so, with the sort of limited scope that we have right now because of the six-week ban, that has really impacted people’s ability to access care in the entire region.”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling cleared the way for states across the South and Midwest to try to enforce six-week bans or outright prohibitions on abortion that were on their books. Dozens of abortion clinics have closed since, with one analysis from July showing that, in the month since the ruling, the number of clinics offering abortion had shrunk from 71 to 28 in the 11 states seeking to implement those extreme restrictions.\n\nThe seven states where no clinics remain open – Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas – accounted for 80,500 abortions in 2020, according to the analysis, which was done by the reproductive rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIn this landscape, abortion seekers will have to travel hundred of miles to obtain the procedure. For many women in the South, particularly if bans in Georgia and Louisiana are enforced, the closest clinic may be in Kansas, Illinois, North Carolina, or elsewhere – potentially across several states’ borders.\n\nSupporters of the restrictions say that courts should follow the US Supreme Court’s lead and let legislatures decide what abortion policy looks like at the state level.\n\n“The careful, thoughtful studied approach as the Georgia legislature took before and during the 2019 session is the way it needs to be addressed,” said Republican state Rep. Ed Setzler, a sponsor of the 2019 Georgia law, which prohibits abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected.\n\n“We recognize life begins at conception but we balanced that with these difficult circumstances and to land where there’s a protection of a child that has a beating heart, that seems to be reasonable sound middle ground,” he said.\n\nThe “significant role” Georgia and Louisiana have played\n\nEven before Roe fell – allowing abortion bans in Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and elsewhere in the South to take effect – abortion seekers were traveling to Louisiana and Georgia to obtain the procedure, in part because of the other ways states were able to complicate access, even with Roe on the books.\n\nGeorgia in particular had clinic infrastructure more expansive than what’s usual in the South; right now, 11 abortion providers are open in the state, according to the National Abortion Federation. Atlanta being an airline hub also makes Georgia clinics accessible for those with the resources to fly to obtain the procedure.\n\nIsaac Maddow-Zimet, a senior research associate with the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights, said he expects to see “huge increases” in people traveling to seeking abortions in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision in the recent case, called Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.\n\n“Many of the states to which patients have historically traveled to obtain abortions have now restricted or eliminated access entirely, which means people seeking care have to travel even farther to obtain it,” he said.\n\nWith a Democratic governor, North Carolina does not have extreme limits like a six week or outright ban” on the procedure at the moment, while in Florida, a 15-week ban is in force while a legal challenge to it continues.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision came down, Georgia’s six-week abortion ban remained on hold for several weeks due to a pre-Dobbs federal court order. Travel from out-of-state patients spiked, according to Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director at the Atlanta-based Feminist Women’s Health Center, who told CNN that just from one clinic in Alabama, nearly 100 abortion patients were referred to Georgia providers in the days immediately after the Dobbs decision.\n\nEven after the six-week ban was allowed to take effect on July 20, traffic from out-of-state patients has continued, she said, in part because early-pregnancy abortions are allowed under it and in part because Georgia’s law has a rape exemption not present in Alabama’s outright ban, nor in the six-week bans in Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\n“When the six-week ban was allowed to go into effect, it certainly has changed how significant a role we can play in the southeast supporting care for neighboring states, but it has not completely eliminated that need,” said Jackson of the Feminist Women’s Health Center.\n\nA Texas six-week ban that was allowed to go into effect last September was a preview of the role Louisiana will play for access if its ban is blocked by courts there. At the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, Texas patients made up nearly two-thirds of the clinic’s patients compared to just 18% of patients before the Texas law was in effect.\n\n“Louisiana had been this kind of stalwart, it had been providing care to people in the entire region,” said Jenny Ma, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who is involved in the challenge to the Louisiana trigger ban.\n\nLouisiana and Georgia “were incredibly important, and continue to be really important,” she told CNN, “and that’s why these lawsuits are so pivotal as they continue to try to preserve access for as long as possible.”\n\nRacial disparities for maternal health\n\nThe lawsuits challenging Louisiana and Georgia’s abortion laws cite those states’ constitutions for why those laws should be struck down.\n\nIn Georgia, the challengers are leaning on the state constitution’s privacy and liberty protections, which ACLU attorney Julie Kaye says have long been interpreted as more expansive than the US Constitution’s.\n\n“For over a century the Georgia Supreme Court has strictly protected an individual’s right to be free from political interference into their private decisions about their body, health and life,” said Kaye, who is involved in the challenge of the Georgia law.\n\nA spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is defending the law in court, declined CNN’s request for an interview. A spokesperson for Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry did not respond to CNN’s inquiries.\n\nLouisiana Right to Life spokesperson Sarah Zagorski told CNN that the anti-abortion group “highly” doubts plaintiffs would be successful in their lawsuit. But if the trigger laws are blocked, Zagorski said it’s likely that Louisiana Right to Life would work with the state legislature again “to tighten our laws.”\n\nThe complaints filed against Louisiana and Georgia’s laws both highlight the maternal health risks of forced pregnant – risks that are exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities in the South and risks that are disproportionately faced by Black women.\n\n“Louisiana ranks second to last, or 48th among states when it comes to the health of women and children,” says an affidavit filed by Dr. Janifer Tropez-Martin. She noted the state’s maternal mortality was increasing at a rate that exceeds the national average while pointing to a study showing that it had increased 28% since 2016.\n\nThe affidavit adds that “Black individuals are 3.3 times more likely to experience maternal death than white individuals.”\n\nAccording to the Georgia complaint, “the pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 2.3 times higher for Black Georgians than it was for non-Hispanic white Georgians.”\n\nAsked about Louisiana’s high maternal mortality rate, Zagorski, of Louisiana Right to Life, said that it was “a tragedy that Louisiana has a high mortality rate among pregnant women, but legal abortion does not improve those rates.”\n\nAcross the South, most states have declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but several states, including Louisiana and Georgia, have temporarily allowed or are planning to allow low-income women to remain enrolled in Medicaid for up to 12 months after childbirth.\n\n“Hopefully as time goes on, culture will change and the question will be how do we reach maternal patients better, how do we support them better, before and after they have their baby,” Zagorski said.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly describe how one study characterized Louisiana’s maternal mortality rate.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Veronica Stracqualursi", "Tierney Sneed", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/abortion-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court officially transmits its judgment overturning Roe v ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA month after releasing its landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court officially transmitted its judgment to the lower courts on Tuesday, a move that will likely trigger more state abortion restrictions to go into effect.\n\nSupreme Court rules state that after an opinion is rendered, the court sends out a certified copy of the judgment prepared and signed by the court’s clerk. The process usually takes about a month.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, some states including Idaho, Tennessee and Texas were waiting for this official word to come before enacting some of their laws to restrict abortions.\n\nRELATED: Where state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges\n\nMore than half the states have laws that ban or severely restrict abortion rights, according to Guttmacher, a nonprofit that tracks abortion access across the country and supports abortion access. Some states had laws on the books that were enacted before Roe, others have so-called trigger laws – meant to take effect automatically if Roe were ever overturned, although they had different timing mechanisms.\n\nOn June 24, in the midst of the most important term in decades, Justice Samuel Alito penned the majority opinion holding that Roe, a landmark 1973 decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to abortion was “egregiously wrong from the start.”\n\n“Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,” Alito said in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. The opinion was nearly identical to a draft version that had been leaked to Politico in May in an unprecedented breach of court protocols.\n\nThe opinion reversed nearly 50 years of precedent and forever changed the landscape of reproductive health. Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by the states unless Congress acts.\n\nThe court’s opinion prompted an angry and rare joint dissent from the court’s three liberal justices. “With sorrow – for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection – we dissent,” they said.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts took a middle ground position and wrote a solo concurrence. He agreed that Mississippi’s abortion law banning the procedure after 15 weeks should be allowed to go into effect, but he said the court should stop short of overturning Roe.\n\nThe high court’s decision has prompted demonstrations across the country, including several protests at the homes of some of the justices in the majority.

Wade.\n\nMississippi’s last abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, has been forced to close its doors this week after the state’s ban took effect Thursday. And in Louisiana, an Orleans Parish Civil District Court judge on Friday lifted a temporary restraining order, allowing the state to enforce its near-total ban on the procedure there.\n\nThe moves underscore the struggle over abortion access at the state level. Legal fights over abortion bans and other laws that greatly limit the procedure are underway in more than a dozen states, as Americans navigate rapidly changing laws and court developments in a post-Roe era.\n\n‘This was a very busy clinic’\n\nKnown as the “Pink House” for operating out of a pink stucco building, Jackson Women’s Health Organization had provided abortion services for decades and was the provider that had brought the lawsuit against Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, which led to the US Supreme Court’s ruling last month.\n\nMississippi’s trigger ban, enacted in 2007, prohibits abortions in the state with only exceptions in cases of rape or to preserve the life of the pregnant person. It took effect Thursday after a Mississippi judge earlier in the week denied a motion by the clinic to block the law.\n\nJackson Women’s Health Organization’s owner Diane Derzis told CNN that the clinic saw 69 patients on Wednesday and did procedures through the day until they had to close, with some follow-up appointments on Thursday.\n\n“This was always a very busy clinic. So we realize the numbers of women who are going to be left in the lurch and will have to travel out of state, or continue a pregnancy, or do something themselves. It’s the latter that worries you more than anything else. Because there’s definitely desperation,” Derzis told CNN.\n\nJackson Women’s Health Organization referred more than 100 patients to its Columbus clinic in the last two days, according to Derzis.\n\nShe said they had begun packing Friday to move to a new clinic in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where she expects they will be opened by next week.\n\n“People should see what has been wrought here with this ruling and how it’s going to affect women, children and their families in this country. This is an outrage in 2022 that women are forced to skulk out of state into another state to receive medical care. It’s just unbelievable,” Derzis told CNN.\n\nThe clinic has appealed to the state’s Supreme Court.\n\n“Mississippians still have a separate and independent right to privacy under the Mississippi Constitution that the Mississippi Supreme Court held encompasses a right to abortion,” Jackson Women’s Health Organization argued in the lawsuit filed last month.\n\n‘This case is by no means over’\n\nDuring a court hearing in Louisiana on Friday, Judge Ethel S. Julien lifted the temporary block on a restrictive abortion ban in the state, clearing the way for the state’s trigger law to immediately take effect and blocking abortion clinics in the state from operating.\n\nLast month, a Louisiana state court blocked the state’s trigger law from being enforced by issuing a temporary restraining order. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry appealed, asking the state Supreme Court to dissolve the lower court’s order. The court denied that appeal and kicked it back to the lower courts for a hearing.\n\nJulien on Friday agreed with the state, that the challenge against the state’s abortion laws should be brought in a Baton Rouge state court, instead of New Orleans, Walt Pierce, the court’s public information officer told CNN.\n\nAbortion providers then asked the judge to continue the temporary restraining order while the case was being transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court. After retiring to her chambers to study the request, Julien ruled she did not have the authority to extend the temporary restraining order, citing her earlier ruling that New Orleans was not the proper venue for the case, Pierce told CNN.\n\nThe challenge to the law by abortion providers will now be transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge.\n\n“Today the judge got it right,” Landry said during a news conference after the hearing, adding, “We certainly intend to continue to defend the laws of the state and to enforce the laws.”\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the litigators in the case, said it plans to “ask the new court in Baton Rouge to block the bans again as soon as possible.”\n\n“Today’s ruling was on a technicality, and did not touch the merits of this case. I am personally devastated for patients in Louisiana who are now panicking trying to figure out how to get care. But to be clear, this case is by no means over,” Jenny Ma, the group’s senior staff attorney, said in a statement Friday.\n\n“Since Roe fell last month, abortion services have ceased in nine other states, and that number is continuing to grow. With every state that bans abortion, the distance patients in the south have to travel grows exponentially. So losing access in Louisiana, even for a day, is contributing to a growing health crisis not only for people in Louisiana but across the south.”\n\nTexas’ largest independent abortion provider closes clinics\n\nJackson Women’s Health Organization isn’t the only southern abortion provider moving its operation.\n\nWhile abortion is effectively banned in Texas with very limited exceptions following the high court decision, abortion is legal in New Mexico.\n\nWhole Woman’s Health, the largest independent abortion provider in Texas, announced on Wednesday that it is closing four clinics in Texas and is seeking a clinic site at a New Mexico border city to provide first and second trimester abortions.\n\nAbortions up to around six weeks into pregnancy had been allowed to resume in Texas after a state court issued a temporary restraining order against the state’s nearly century-old abortion ban. But late last Friday, the Texas Supreme Court paved the way for Texas’ pre-Roe abortion ban to be civilly enforced, prompting the clinics to again cease providing abortion services.\n\nThe state’s trigger law also goes into effect in the next few weeks.\n\nOther clinics in the state, such as Planned Parenthood’s three Texas affiliates, Houston Women’s Clinic and Houston Women’s Reproductive Services, have said they are unable to provide abortion care in the wake of Roe being overturned.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Alta Spells", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Alta Spells"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/09/08/florida-supreme-court-hears-arguments-about-future-of-abortion-rights/70789793007/", "title": "Florida abortion law goes before state Supreme Court", "text": "John Kennedy\n\nCapital Bureau | USA TODAY NETWORK – FLORIDA\n\nTALLAHASSEE – A case shaping the future of abortion in Florida played out Friday before the state Supreme Court, with attorneys for the state and Planned Parenthood affiliates dueling over the meaning of a voter-approved privacy clause in the state constitution.\n\nAttorneys for the government led by Gov. Ron DeSantis contend Florida’s highest court got it wrong 34 years ago when it ruled that women had a right to seek abortions without government interference under the state’s constitutional privacy right.\n\nJustices on the current, seven-member court, with five members appointed by DeSantis, are being asked to reverse their predecessors, who unanimously concluded that abortion rights were shielded by the privacy provision approved by 61% of Florida voters in 1980.\n\nBut Henry Whitaker, the state’s solicitor general, argued that voters were not thinking about abortion rights when they amended the constitution. Instead, he said, it was about safeguarding personal information in the developing computer age.\n\n“It was explained and sold to the people solely on informational privacy,” Whitaker told justices.\n\nWhat's at stake before Supreme Court:Abortion access on the line in Florida before DeSantis-heavy Supreme Court\n\nHow privacy got into state constitution:Florida has a unique right protecting abortion. Its framers designed it that way.\n\nBut Whitney White, attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, representing Planned Parenthood, argued that while personal information is protected with the amendment, nothing prohibits it from also shielding abortion access.\n\nFlorida justices in 1989 clearly endorsed that view, she said.\n\n“There’s plenty of evidence that’s consistent with the original meaning and understanding of privacy extending to abortion rights,” White said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and others are challenging as unconstitutional Florida’s law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Leon County Judge John Cooper last year struck down the law citing the 1989 privacy ruling by the more liberal-leaning state Supreme Court.\n\nBut current justices allowed that 15-week standard to remain in place for the past year, as the case made its way to the Supreme Court for Friday’s arguments, which spanned just over an hour.\n\nIf the court sides with the governor and the state, the 15-week law will be upheld – for now.\n\nBut DeSantis, who is struggling in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, earlier this year signed into law a so-called fetal heartbeat law, which bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThat six-week standard would take effect 30 days after justices reverse the 1989 ruling the privacy shields abortion access.\n\nBut if the court strikes down the 15-week ban, abortions would once again be legal up until 24 weeks of pregnancy, seen as the age a fetus is viable outside a mother's womb. Abortion rights advocates say they are pessimistic about the prospect of Florida's court rejecting DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature's approach.\n\n“We think that the state has a compelling interest, in all stages of pregnancy, in preserving life,” Whitaker told the court. “Whatever you think about the status of unborn life, at any particular stage of pregnancy, it is a life in some sense and is unquestionably extinguished by the abortion decision.”\n\nAttorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, took the unusual step of appearing at the Supreme Court, sitting at the table with fellow lawyers from her office defending the state law.\n\nThree justices on the court appointed by DeSantis are women. The court, however, has clearly turned conservative under the governor, with Chief Justice Carlos Muniz at one point during arguments calling an “abomination,” the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nFederal justices last year overturned that ruling, sending it back to states to regulate abortion, clearing the way for Florida to enact the six-week law.\n\nJustice John Couriel also acknowledged that a measure which should be considered in the eventual ruling is that 55% of Florida voters in 2012 rejected a ballot measure that would've blocked the state constitution from protecting abortion rights, basically showing support among Floridians for the 1989 ruling.\n\nThe state, however, wants justices to focus primarily on the lack of abortion discussion during the 1980 ballot campaign.\n\nJustices peppered attorneys for both sides with questions not only about the meaning of the 1980 ruling but the legal standing of Planned Parenthood in challenging the 15-week law, along with the Legislature’s role in balancing the rights of women and the fetuses they are carrying.\n\n“This court really hasn’t considered before what the 1980 amendment meant, and I think they will make that decision clearly educated on all the issues,” said Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, a sponsor of the six-week law who attended Friday’s hearing.\n\nShe said it’s right for the court to review its past ruling.\n\n“It is a shift change in the way the amendment was originally interpreted. It does not mean that’s the way it should have been interpreted,” she added.\n\nSen. Lauren Book, D-Plantation, also attended Friday’s hearing and said the hopes of abortion rights advocates rest with a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at the November 2024 ballot.\n\n“We have a shining light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.\n\nThe ballot proposal would guarantee abortion access up until fetal viability put at 24 weeks gestational age.\n\nThe proposal aimed at voters has collected enough signatures – officially close to 300,000 – to trigger a review of its ballot language by the Florida Supreme Court. Book said thousands more have been collected and just await verification by elections officials.\n\nAlmost 900,000 valid petition signatures are needed to get on the ballot.\n\n“To have collected that many petitions in such a short amount of time I believe tells people where the state of Florida is on this issue,” Book said.\n\nThe 1980 privacy provision is concise, but mentions few specifics.\n\nIt says: “Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion in the person’s private life except as otherwise provided herein. This section shall not be construed to limit the public’s right of access to public records and meetings as provided by law.”\n\nWhen it went before Florida voters, the U.S. Supreme Court had approved abortion rights only seven years earlier, relying heavily on privacy-related protections in the federal constitution. But Floridians wanted to go further, White argued for Planned Parenthood.\n\nNewspaper accounts and other records from that era mostly fail to mention abortion as being protected by the Florida amendment. But White said that doesn’t mean it was excluded from voters’ thinking.\n\n“It’s impossible to understand what was really going through people’s heads at that time,” White told justices.\n\n“Freedom from government interference meant a number of different things,” she added. “That includes informational privacy protections that the state focused on, but it also included freedom from government interference with deeply personal and private decisions that affect one’s health, one’s family, one’s future, and abortion falls squarely within that protection.”\n\nWhitaker, though, said it’s clear that abortion wasn’t considered protected, given that there were few references to it in the lead-up to the 1980 vote.\n\n“It is unimaginable... that it would’ve included abortion, given the mere absence of references in the public debate over the question,” Whitaker said.\n\nMuniz, though, summarized at least one of the questions before justices.\n\n“How should we go about the process of trying to figure out how a Floridian in 1980 would’ve understood the concept of government intrusion into a person’s private life?” Muniz asked Whitaker.\n\nThe solicitor general said the historical record can be used. But there’s even a dictionary meaning available, he said.\n\n“You can’t really use a dictionary to find out what a person thinks is a governmental intrusion into my private life,” Muniz dismissed.\n\nJohn Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network’s Florida Capital Bureau.

Wade to a federal appeals court so that the state can attempt to put in place its strict parental notification law that had been blocked.\n\nIndiana had sent its request to Justice Amy Coney Barrett, but she took no part in the case presumably because she was sitting on the Chicago-based federal appeals court when the case was initially before it. As a result, the application was handled by Roberts.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky had said it would not object to expediting the judgment.\n\nAt issue in the dispute is a state law that requires parents to be notified if a minor seeks an abortion, unless a court finds that the notification is not in the best interest of the child.

In its 2018 decision – issued before the state’s Republican governor appointed four of the seven current justices – the high court struck down a state law that required a 72-hour waiting period for an abortion as unconstitutional.\n\n“All we hold today is that the Iowa Constitution is not the source of a fundamental right to an abortion necessitating a strict scrutiny standard of review for regulations affecting that right,” Justice Edward Mansfield wrote for the majority.\n\nThe court’s ruling concerned a case challenging a 2020 state law that would require women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. The statute had been blocked from going into effect by a lower court.\n\nIowa lawmakers in 2020 added the 24-hour abortion restriction to a bill limiting courts’ ability to withdraw life-sustaining procedures.\n\nLast year, a district judge blocked the law from going into effect, ruling it unconstitutional because it violated the Iowa Supreme Court’s 2018 decision and the Iowa constitution’s “single-subject rule” by adding the restriction to an unrelated bill. The state had appealed the lower court’s decision.\n\nIn its opinion issued Friday, the Iowa Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision and sent it back.\n\nThe court also found that “no violation of the single-subject rule took place,” saying that “both pertain to the subject of ‘medical procedures.’”\n\nChief Justice Susan Christensen, however, concurred in part with the majority opinion, but “out of respect for stare decisis,” dissented from the majority’s decision to overrule the court’s 2018 decision.\n\nTwo other justices dissented in part, saying they would rule at this time that the 24-hour waiting period should be considered under a rational basis test.\n\nThe US Supreme Court will soon issue an opinion that could reverse Roe v. Wade, transforming the landscape of women’s reproductive health across country and allowing states to set abortion policies. A leaked draft opinion reported by Politico in May showed that the court would strike down its landmark decision.\n\nIowa currently bans abortion after 20 weeks. The state currently does not have a “trigger law” that would ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law, which would ban abortions at about six weeks when early cardiac activity is detected, was struck down in 2019. The legislature has also been working to pass a constitutional amendment that would declare that the state constitution “does not recognize grant, or secure a right to abortion or require the public funding of abortion.”\n\nIowa Republicans, including Gov. Kim Reynolds and state House Speaker Pat Grassley, celebrated Friday’s ruling, calling it a “significant victory” and a “positive step” in their fight against abortion.\n\nReynolds, who had signed the 2020 legislation and the “fetal heartbeat” bill, said on Twitter that “every life is sacred and should be protected, and as long as I’m governor that is exactly what I will do.”\n\n“As we work to understand the full impact of this decision, Iowans can be assured that Iowa House Republicans are strongly pro-life and remain committed to protecting the unborn and providing additional support for new mothers,” Grassley said in a statement.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/supreme-court-kentucky-abortion/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court allows Kentucky's GOP attorney general to defend ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to step in to defend a controversial abortion law, after the Democratic governor declined to continue doing so.\n\nThe law restricts a standard second-trimester abortion method known as “dilation and evacuation” that is used after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It was signed into law in 2018 but has so far been blocked by the courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling doesn’t address the constitutionality of the law. Instead, the dispute involved a procedural issue: whether the attorney general could step in to defend the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal.\n\nThe court’s 8-1 decision revives the case at hand and will make it easier for states that elect their attorneys general to defend laws when a state official from an opposing party has a different viewpoint.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said that the federal appeals court should not have ruled that the attorney general was unable to intervene to defend the law. He said “a State’s opportunity to defend its laws in federal court should not be lightly cut off.”\n\nThursday’s opinion comes as the justices allowed Texas’ strict six-week abortion ban to remain in effect and as they are considering the future of Roe v. Wade in a case concerning a restrictive abortion law in Mississippi.\n\nThe decision wasn’t a complete surprise because during oral arguments last month in a case that raised some similar legal issues, Justice Stephen Breyer accidentally gave away the result of the Kentucky case even before the opinion had been released.\n\nKentucky is one of several states where attorneys general are elected – giving rise to potential conflicts if the governor of a state is of a different party. Abortion providers expressed concern that it the state’s attorney general in the case at hand prevailed, the legal dispute would continue.\n\nComplicated procedural background\n\nThe Kentucky abortion law was signed in 2018 by Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, and immediately challenged by EMW Women’s Surgical Center and two of its doctors. They argued the law imposed an undue burden on the right to pre-viability abortion.\n\nThen-Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said his office did not have the authority to defend the law and he agreed to be bound by the decision of the state’s secretary of health.\n\nAfter a five-day bench trial, a district court blocked the law, and the case went to the federal appeals court. At the same time, however, an election occurred and Beshear became governor. In the same election, Republican Daniel Cameron was elected attorney general.\n\nAfter an appeals court affirmed the district court’s decision, the divide between the parties opened: Beshear’s administration said it would not appeal the decision.\n\nThat prompted Cameron to intervene in the case, attempting to revive the dispute, only to lose when the federal appeals court said his request came too late. The lower court emphasized that the office of the attorney general had already agreed to step out of the case, and now it was too late to try to step back in.\n\nCameron appealed to the Supreme Court. Kentucky’s Principal Deputy Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn told the justices that as a matter of Kentucky law, Cameron has the final say on whether to accept a decision that enjoined a state law, and that even under the previous attorney general, the office had preserved the ability of the attorney general to “participate in any appeal.”\n\nHe said Cameron “had the ability to protect Kentucky’s interests when it became unrepresented” and that the decision to defend the law represented a “hand off” from one state official to another.\n\nWriting in dissent on Thursday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court’s liberal members, said the appeals court had come to the right conclusion.\n\n“In every case, there must be a point of time when litigation shall be at an end,” she wrote. She said she feared her colleagues’ decision would “open the floodgates for government officials to evade the consequences of litigation decisions made by their predecessors of different political parties undermining finality and upsetting the settled expectations of courts, litigants, and the public alike.”\n\nIn court, Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, stressed that the office of attorney general had already spoken on the law during an earlier phase of the proceedings and that Cameron stands in the “shoes of his predecessor.”\n\n“Intervention is not a revolving door,” she said, and added that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by holding that Cameron’s attempt to get into the case came too late.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Thursday.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}]}

The project is being financed with a commercial loan, she said.\n\n\"Keeping your product well maintained and 'fresh' increases desirability,\" said Jeanne Liu, senior vice president of research at Longwoods International USA Inc., a consultancy that compiles tourism industry statistics for Visit Seattle. \"There are a lot of places to visit in this world, and those destinations with a solid tourism infrastructure that is well maintained can use that as a competitive advantage.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/plymouth-township/2017/05/09/big-changes-proposed-inn-st-johns/101242146/", "title": "Big changes proposed for The Inn at St. John's", "text": "Darrell Clem\n\nhometownlife.com\n\nMassive changes topping $100 million are looming for The Inn at St. John's, an upscale Plymouth Township landmark and former Catholic seminary that offers a luxury hotel, golfing, gourmet dining and events such as weddings, charity galas and corporate meetings.\n\nOfficials and developers have revealed a far-reaching makeover they say should position St. John's for the future. The property, southeast of Five Mile and Sheldon, dates back to 1948 and is owned by the Archdiocese of Detroit.\n\nConsider the changes:\n\nThe 27-hole golf course would be reduced to 18 holes.\n\nReal estate company Toll Brothers aims to build 174 multi-family townhouses using a portion of the golf course. Mike Noles, the company's senior vice president of land development, said the homes are expected to start in the $300,000 range and sell for as much as $500,000.\n\nThe monastery retreat center would be converted to 120 hotel rooms, doubling the number of guest rooms on the St. John's site.\n\nA three-acre parcel on the southwest corner of the property would be developed, possibly as a restaurant, retail shops, medical offices, an assisted living center or luxury apartments — depending on what appears feasible.\n\n\"We'll see what the market will support,\" said Leo Gonzalez, president of Plymouth-based Commercial Real Estate Services.\n\nGonzalez and others involved in the project rolled out proposed changes for the 175-acre site during a recent Plymouth Township Board of Trustees session. The board was expected to vote as early as this week to give the project the go-ahead by amending an earlier planned unit development agreement.\n\n\"I think it's a very good thing for Plymouth Township,\" Supervisor Kurt Heise said. \"It shows that we are a very desirable community and that we're a destination residence for people looking for a unique living experience.\n\n\"I think this project is going to increase the profile of Plymouth Township and make us even more desirable,\" he added. \"I think we will attract new residents who want to possibly retire here and make Plymouth Township their home.\"\n\nNoles said at least a portion of the new townhouses will be marketed to empty-nesters, or residents who no longer have children at home.\n\nNed McGrath, Archdiocese director of communications, said a decision to sell and develop a portion of the land will generate revenue that, in turn, can be used for other improvements.\n\n\"This is seen as an opportunity resulting from a purchase proposal and is seen as a way to build on St. John’s financial and spiritual success,\" McGrath said.\n\nHe said it's too early to say when the project could start, but officials are \"working hard toward a 2018 start date.\"\n\nThe current project aside, McGrath said there are no more immediate changes to announce.\n\n\"Due to the nature of the business, keeping the property current is always a challenge. The goal is to keep St. John’s the very best,\" he said. \"While there are no changes to be announced at this time, management is well aware of competitive trends. There is no plan to change the status of the chapel at St. John’s or wedding ministry there.\"\n\nGonzalez said the popularity of St. John's as a place for large weddings, receptions and other events points to the need for more hotel rooms.\n\nLyle Winn, senior project engineer with Anderson, Eckstein and Westrick Inc., said the project would usher in some traffic-related changes such as improving traffic lights, turn lanes and driveways at St. John's. Winn also said a popular St. John's event, the Concours d'Elegance, an annual show featuring some of the world's top classic automobiles, is being taken into consideration.\n\n\"It's very much in our discussions,\" he said.\n\nMore on hometownlife.com:\n\nFire station could reopen in Plymouth Township\n\nAuction benefits Park radio program\n\nTownship Clerk Jerry Vorva said changes will allow St. John's to lure bigger conventions and other events.

He said clusters of hotels can accommodate bigger events.\n\n\"I think it's a great project,\" he said, adding later, \"I have no concerns at all with it.\"\n\ndclem@hometownlife.com\n\nTwitter: @CantonObserver\n\n734-972-0919", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/02/26/restoration-fisher-building/98308612/", "title": "Artisans giving Detroit's historic Fisher Building a makeover", "text": "Ann Zaniewski\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nThe building known as Detroit's \"largest art object\" is in the midst of a makeover.\n\nExpert artisans perched high on scaffolding inside the Fisher Building are meticulously repairing and touching up the ornate murals that cover the soaring, vaulted arcade. The two-month project is the first in a series of renovations planned for the historic Fisher by its new owners, the Platform, a Detroit development firm.\n\nWater damage from leaky pipes, layers of grime and poorly executed previous restorations have all taken a toll.\n\n\"We started with a conservator and a plasterer, and we’ve got two decorative painters out there now,\" said Terry VanderWell, director of restoration for EverGreene Architectural Arts, the company performing the restoration.\n\nThe conservator traced patterns, documented colors and sized up plaster and canvas damage, VanderWell said. Multiple areas of damaged plaster had to be repaired, including on the dome that joins two long corridors, before painting started.\n\nThe ceiling restoration is estimated to cost about $500,000. In all, the Platform is expected to spend about $100 million between sprucing up the Fisher and turning the nearby Albert Kahn Building into residences, said Dan Austin, spokesman for the Platform. The company is also working on a number of other projects in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Albert Kahn-designed Fisher building, built by the Fisher brothers, opened Sept. 1, 1928, as a hub for shopping, business and entertainment.\n\nMore than 40 kinds of marble were used in construction. The interior is an ornate world of majestic mosaics, brass and bronze touches and beautifully painted ceilings in hues of gold, green, blue, red and orange.\n\nRelated:\n\n► 10 fascinating facts about Detroit's Fisher Building\n\n► A few minutes with... a man who built the Fisher building out of Legos\n\nHungarian artist Geza R.

They are preserving original details and replicating the areas that were lost using stencils made from other parts of the design.\n\nThere have been some challenges. In some areas, parts of the same pattern or design are painted in slightly different shades that don't match the rest. And the original hand-painted designs don't always have crisp or even borders.\n\nWorkers could see water damage on the interior surface of the dome, but didn't realize its extent until they got up close.\n\n\"Once we got up there, we tapped on the surface, and we could tell there was a hollow spot in there\" where layers of plaster had deteriorated and began to separate, VanderWell said. \"We injected consolidants to stabilize it.\"\n\nThe Platform is a co-owner of the Fisher Building, as well as the agent in charge of its restoration and event programming. The ownership group also includes New York-based HFZ Capital Group and Rheal Capital Management.\n\nEverGreene Architectural Arts, with offices in New York City and near Chicago, has restored buildings all over the world, from churches, state capitals and theaters to famous landmarks like the Empire State Building.\n\n\"(The Fisher Building) is one of those few buildings where every surface was considered in terms of materials and decoration,\" VanderWell said. \"It all tied together, from the designs on the floors to the materials used for the walls.

About a mile from City Hall, Gadsden’s Wharf is where slave ships docked for years and unloaded at least 100,000 slaves.\n\nUp to 800 enslaved Africans “quarantined there died during the cold winter of 1807 and were unceremoniously thrown into a mass grave nearby,” according to a report from the Post and Courier newspaper.\n\n“Committed reckoning with history is a necessary stop on the road to healing and reconciliation,” Tonya Matthews, who was named as the museum’s president and CEO last week, said in a news release.\n\nPlans for the museum were first publicly announced by the former Mayor of Charleston, Joseph P. Riley, Jr., in 2000. “Our journey has been long because it took time to secure the optimal site,” the former mayor said in a statement.\n\nRiley said, “it took time to raise the resources, assemble the team, and plan every detail that would enhance the experience of being here. And it took time because we have been committed to excellence.”\n\nThe museum will include nine exhibition galleries, and an “African Ancestors Memorial Garden” on the ground floor that will have a clear view of the ocean.\n\nThe 150,000-square-foot museum is located at Gadsden's Wharf. IAAM - Ellis Creek Photography\n\nCharleston is often mentioned as one of the top cities in the world to visit for its beauty, grand homes, food and its legendary Southern charm, but like many cities in the South, it is haunted by slavery. In 2018, the city apologized for its role on the slave trade.\n\nMore than 48% of all African slaves who came to the United States entered through Charleston, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard professor and historian said in a release from the museum.\n\n“So, for blackness, black culture, the African experience, the African American experience, slavery – however you want to slice it – this is ground zero,” said Gates.\n\nIn addition to the memorial and galleries, the museum will include a large genealogy library allowing African American ancestry research. Gates, who is also known for his popular PBS series on ancestry, “Finding Your Roots,” helped shape the museum’s Center for Family History.\n\nGates is among the dozens of advisory board members, which include US Rep. James Clyburn, actress Phylicia Rashad and Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture’s founding director.\n\nIn recent years, other Southern cities have begun the process of reckoning with past sins of lynching and Jim Crow-era segregation.\n\nIn 2018, the first monument in the United States honoring the victims of lynching opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The Equal Justice Initiative dedicated the monument – The National Memorial for Peace and Justice – to the legacy of enslaved Black people, “African Americans humiliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence.”", "authors": ["Devon M.

Market St. building owned by YMCA of York County, said Larry Richardson, YMCA of York County CEO.\n\nThe organization has leased 7,800 square feet — most of the usable space, Richardson said.\n\nThe building will serve as a hub for technology companies and accelerated computer training programs, said John McElligott, the area entrepreneur who launched the project.\n\nHere are five things to know about the Fortress Initiative and what it's planning for York.\n\n1. Computer programming classes could be coming to York.\n\nMcElligott said he hopes to see accelerated education providers conducting computer coding classes at the site. His related entity, the Fortress Academy, is seeking state certification.\n\nThe Fortress Academy is among the York-based groups that hope to benefit from a $2.9 million federal grant to provide computer programming instruction, an effort led by area manufacturing group MANTEC.\n\nThe grant program is part of the federal TechHire Initiative, an effort \"to expand opportunities for young Americans to get trained and placed into well-paying tech jobs,\" according to a November 2015 White House news release.\n\nThe federal government has earmarked $100 million for the initiative, including $50 million aimed at helping 17- to 26-year-olds who have faced obstacles in achieving a traditional education.\n\n2. The group plans to restore the bank building.\n\nThe Western National Bank Building once had tall windows and a large front entrance, which have since been bricked over and sealed. McElligott's team plans to restore the building to its original design, he said.\n\nThat restoration project was also a factor in YMCA of York County's decision to lease the building to the company, Richardson said.\n\n\"We thought their purpose matched well with our mission, but also we liked their restoration ideas, which we thought would be good for the Weco neighborhood,\" Richardson said, referring to the west-of-Codorus-Creek neighborhood in York.\n\nIn total, renovations will cost almost $500,000, which is being acquired through private donors, McElligott said.\n\nYork groups apply for $2.9 million training grant\n\n3. York companies need computer programmers.\n\nEmployers in South Central Pennsylvania need computer programmers, said John Dolmetsch, president of BIG Wireless.\n\nHis information technology company employs about 90 engineers in York, he said. However, because qualified local applicants are so hard to find, 40 percent of his employees live out of state.\n\n“I’m excited for what John’s doing because we have a significant difficulty finding software design talent in Central Pa.,\" he said. “The last 10 that we’ve hired live in different states. We can’t find that talent. We don’t have a lot of high-tech talent in Central Pennsylvania, and especially in York.”\n\n4. More jobs could be coming.\n\nThe Fortress Initiative project also happens to coincide with another big tech project in York, and that could create a synergy that would add jobs and economic impact, McElligott said. York-based United Fiber and Data is working to funnel high-speed internet into the city, part of a planned fiber-optic line spanning from New York to Ashburn, Virginia. That infrastructure would be useful to technology projects at the former bank building.\n\nUFD's fiber-optic line travels under Hudson River\n\n5. The project should begin soon.\n\nConstruction should begin within the next couple months and should finish by the end of the year, McElligott said.

It wasn't unusual for groupies to head to the hotel's bar, hoping for a post-show glimpse of a performer in need of a nightcap.\n\nDuring summer, meeting friends for a beer at The Edgewater's pier was a worthy alternative to lounging with coeds at the University of Wisconsin's Memorial Union Terrace. My memories are a bit dusty, since the hotel was closed in 2012, but you could count on The Edgewater to be a curiously attractive mix of elegant, accessible and frumpy.\n\nWhen hotel owner and developer Robert Dunn decided a wholesale makeover was in order, most of us didn't quite know what to think.

The final stages of the renovation, including an east facade glass canopy, video screen above the main entrance and upgrades of meeting rooms and concourses, are slated for completion by June.\n\n\"In my 40-year career, I have never seen the amount of change that has happened in such a compressed period of time to improve the stature, marketability and appeal of a convention destination as has occurred in Detroit,\" Connors said.\n\nHighlights of a rebirth\n\nWhat better way to kick off the rebirth of the much-maligned Motor City on the heels of its exit from Chapter 9 bankruptcy than with:\n\n■ Cobo Center looking better than it has in forever, welcoming 5,025 journalists from 60 nations.\n\n■ The auto industry rejuvenated and posting strong sales and profits as consumers enjoy plunging gasoline prices and low-interest loans.\n\n■ The auto show floor full of glamor, power and some surprises, such as Ford's GT supercar and Chevrolet's Bolt concept combining 200-mile range and affordable price point in a next-generation electric car.\n\n■ Industry innovation talk from Elon Musk of Tesla, Chris Urmson of Google Cars, plus CEOs Carlos Ghosn of Renault-Nissan, Sergio Marchionne of FCA, Dieter Zetsche of Daimler AG, Mary Barra of General Motors and Mark Fields of Ford about the rapid and radical changes about to rock our world in the very near future.\n\nPositive attitude\n\nBy any measure, it has been a robust week for Detroit.\n\nMacomb County Executive Mark Hackel said the transformation of Cobo and downtown Detroit in recent years extends beyond the physical construction.\n\n\"People are more inviting; the staff here is more engaging,\" Hackel said at Cobo last week. \"And you can feel it especially around the downtown area.\"\n\nA few years ago with the industry in the doldrums, some major foreign car companies skipped the Detroit show or scaled back their presence. Not so anymore.\n\nZetsche, the Daimler CEO who ran Chrysler in Auburn Hills from 2000 to 2005, said last week that \"if you are in the auto world, you must be in Detroit to start the new year.\"\n\nUrmson, Google's head of self-driving cars, said the brainpower and experience of metro Detroit are essential elements of future car development. Google's self-driving car team is based mainly in Silicon Valley, he said, but vehicle prototypes are being built in Livonia.\n\nDetroit has been mass-producing vehicles for so long, many people take its know-how for granted.\n\n\"You forget just how complicated that is,\" he said in a Free Press interview last week, \"and how much engineering effort, thought and design it takes, how smart the people are that are able to pull this off ... at scale, every day. I think anyone who looks at Silicon Valley as the only place that innovation happens is dead wrong.\"\n\nSome challenges ahead\n\nTo be sure, Detroit and its auto industry still face many challenges.\n\nMexico and the American South want auto jobs and plants, too, while Silicon Valley and other spots want a share of action in future automotive technology and mobility innovations.\n\nUAW workers want a raise and changes in the two-tier wage structure, with 2015 a key contract bargaining year now that the auto industry bailouts are history.\n\nThat said, though, it's all right to embrace the enthusiasm and excitement that put Detroit in the national spotlight for a frigid January week.\n\nLast, with something for everyone at NAIAS as the public jams the show floor this week — powerful supercars from Ford and Acura, a Rebel Ram from FCA, an electric Bolt and a 640-horsepower CTS-V from Cadillac — one wonders what the ghost of Alfred Sloan might be thinking if he were floating around the 2015 show.\n\nIt was 90 years ago, in his 1924 annual report to GM shareholders, that the legendary CEO explained his famous market segment strategy of \"a car for every purse and purpose.\"\n\nYou think Alfred had Tesla, Google and 3D printed cars in his mind's eye?\n\nContact Tom Walsh: 313-223-4430 or twalsh@freepress.com, also follow him on Twitter @TomWalsh_freep.\n\nSome naysayers\n\nNot all of the 5,025 journalists were gushing about NAIAS and Detroit's future last week.

Levitt\n\nBloomberg News\n\nDevelopers and their backers aim to build the critical mass needed for Newark to improve its image\n\nThe city is “probably the beneficiary of an overheated New York market\n\nAbout 2,000 residential units were approved for construction last year\n\nFor years, downtown Newark’s Military Park, barren and surrounded by vacant buildings, was a symbol of the despair that set in after the 1967 riots. Now it’s at the center of hope that a long-sought recovery for New Jersey’s biggest city may finally be taking hold.\n\nAcross from the park’s northern edge, the old Hahne & Co. department store debuted last month as a $174 million redevelopment with 160 apartments and a Rutgers University arts program and jazz museum currently displaying such artifacts as Miles Davis’ trumpet and a gown worn by Ella Fitzgerald. There will also be offices, a restaurant by celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson and a Whole Foods supermarket scheduled to open Wednesday, bringing life to a building that had sat empty since 1987.\n\nA reputation for crime and poverty has kept Newark mostly on the sidelines of the urban revival that’s transformed swaths of blight into trendy neighborhoods across the U.S. A surge of construction, with the Hahne’s project at its heart, is a sign the city’s luck may be about to change. Developers and their backers — Prudential Financial Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. among them — are aiming to build the critical mass needed for Newark to improve its image and fill new towers with residents who prize affordability and easy access to mass transit.\n\nThe city is “probably the beneficiary of an overheated New York market, where there’s money looking to land,” said Jeff Kolodkin,a New Jersey-based managing director at brokerage Newmark Grubb Knight Frank. With a multitude of companies investing in Newark, “even if a project or two doesn’t go as well as everyone would hope, all of them are not going to go bad.”\n\nAbout 2,000 residential units were approved for construction last year, adding to the 2,000 that have been built since 2014, according to the city Department of Economic and Housing Development. In that period, about $1.7 billion has been invested in residential, commercial and industrial projects.\n\nNewark’s comeback has been predicted before — in the late 1990s with the opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and a minor-league baseball stadium, and again almost a decade later with the Prudential Center hockey arena — but the hoped-for revival never fully blossomed.\n\n“Folks have been probably overlooking Newark for a long period of time,” Mayor Ras Baraka said in a phone interview. “It just needed us to be really focused on it, market it, to push hard around development.”\n\nPrudential, founded and based in Newark, is backing multiple projects, including a 22-story rental property rising near the arts center, to be called One Theater Square, and a conversion of the old New Jersey Bell office tower into apartments.\n\nAffordable rents\n\nThe insurer provided two-thirds of the $30 million of equity for the Hahne’s project, with the rest coming from L+M Development Partners Inc., a New York-based real estate firm, and Goldman Sachs. Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley made loans. The developers received city tax abatements in return for reserving 40 percent of the apartments for low- and moderate-income renters, and hiring Newark residents to help reconstruct the circa-1900 property.\n\nLeases have been signed for 40 of the building’s market-rate apartments, including a one-bedroom with views of Military Park and the Manhattan skyline in the distance, for $2,100 a month, according to L+M. A similar apartment in New York’s Chelsea section would command $3,700 a month, according to a January report by brokerage Citi Habitats.\n\n“That’s why we feel like the proposition is so reasonable,” said Jonathan Cortell, vice president of development for L+M. “We’re asking the metro New York area to re-embrace Newark, in part because it’s stupid-expensive to rent in New York.”\n\nPark makeover\n\nMilitary Park, six acres that date back to the city’s founding in 1666, has itself gotten a makeover. The once-desolate commons now features fresh plantings, a carousel, a hamburger restaurant, weekly midday yoga classes and a schedule of arts and culture programs. The design was conceived by Biederman Redevelopment Ventures, the firm responsible for a similar overhaul of Manhattan’s Bryant Park.\n\n“In Newark, everyone fled from public space, people were afraid of being assaulted,” said Dan Biederman, the firm’s president. “It was so deserted, I’m not sure there was that much crime.”\n\nRevival efforts got a jump start under Cory Booker, mayor from 2006 to 2013, who convinced Wall Street titans such as Bill Ackman, Leon Cooperman and Julian Robertson that the city was worth saving. Booker, now a U.S. senator, drew in more than $250 million in pledges, including $100 million for schools from Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nNewark remains a long way from a full-fledged cultural and real estate renaissance. A study of government data released in December by WalletHub, a web-based credit-counseling service, ranked Newark the 14th neediest among the 150 largest U.S. cities, and fourth-worst for health and safety. Newark’s low score was due to crime, homelessness and “a pretty high percentage of residents without health coverage,” said Jill Gonzalez, lead analyst for the team that conducted the WalletHub study.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the mostly black and Hispanic population live in poverty, according to a 2015 Census Bureau survey.\n\nAbandoned buildings\n\nThe city also has no shortage of vacant lots and abandoned or underused buildings, said Barry Hersh, associate professor at New York University’s Schack Institute of Real Estate.\n\n“You’re talking about 40 or 50 years of neglect, and you can’t turn that around overnight,” said Hersh, who noted that about a half-dozen of his students are working on projects in Newark, which wouldn’t have happened in the past. “But you’re beginning to see a bit of an upturn.”\n\nPrevious attempts at reviving Newark after the July 1967 riots — six days of uprisings and police brutality that killed 26 people — were geared toward commuters and people visiting for a sports event or performance, said Mark Krasovic, interim director of Rutgers-Newark’s Clement A. Price Institute. One early effort revolved around the Gateway Center, a group of skyscrapers with garages and walkways connected to Newark’s Penn Station rail hub, so workers heading home to the suburbs never had to set foot above ground and contribute to the street life.\n\nViolence fears\n\nIn a lot of people’s minds, the riots made Newark “a place they were afraid to go to, that became marked by violence,” Krasovic said. “That’s a trope that still isn’t quite dead, although I don’t think it holds as strong a grip on the city as it used to.”\n\nViolent crime fell about 21 percent in the three years through 2016, according to a Rutgers University analysis of data from the FBI and Newark Police Department. There were 2,764 violent crimes last year, compared with 3,516 in 2013.\n\n“Though the world focuses on it,” crime in Newark “is moving downward and not upward,” Baraka said. “We’re not just trying to develop a downtown that is safe. We’re also trying to spread that into neighborhoods and the community at the same time.”\n\nPrudential investments\n\nFor Prudential, investment in its home city has totaled $907 million since 2010, including $500 million on its headquarters tower. The insurer has bankrolled 1,028 new dwellings in that time, including a 206-unit development downtown called Teachers Village.\n\nAt Theater Square, Prudential and Fifth Third Bancorp are backing developer Dranoff Properties. Rents will range from $1,250 to $4,500 a month, and 24 of the 245 units are to be designated affordable. Prudential is also providing debt for the New Jersey Bell tower conversion, teaming again with L+M, which last year bought the property for $16.5 million. Plans call for maintaining the art-deco facade of the landmarked sandstone skyscraper, built in 1929 by Ralph Walker. While Prudential has stuck with Newark since its founding in 1875, now is an especially good time to invest in the city, said Ommeed Sathe, the company’s vice president for impact investments at the insurer. Backing from equity partners such as L+M is “a huge sign of confidence, crucial to bringing in other capital providers,” and helps ensure that “a project is going to be done with the utmost quality, on time and on budget,” Sathe said.\n\nFailed ballpark\n\nPrudential has also helped finance plans for a 2.3 million-square-foot project at the site of a failed minor-league baseball park. Developer Lotus Equity Group intends to replace Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium, built in 1998, with a complex featuring apartments, stores, cultural spaces and offices.\n\nNewark’s base of office tenants has expanded in recent years to include electronics maker Panasonic Corp., audio-book seller Audible.com and telecommunications company IDT Corp., all of whose names adorn the tops of the downtown buildings they occupy.\n\nThe revival is starting to show up in rising property prices, with a two-building office complex selling in September for $174.5 million, up almost 20 percent from when it last sold a decade earlier, data from Real Capital Analytics Inc. show.\n\nMayor Baraka said Newark is intent on not becoming “another Brooklyn,” and not allowing longtime residents to be displaced by affluent gentrifiers. He backs an “inclusionary” zoning proposal now working its way through the city council that requires 20 percent of multifamily projects to be affordable.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/08/03/seattles-space-needle-worlds-only-rotating-glass-floor/900146002/", "title": "Seattle's Space Needle opens the world's only rotating glass floor", "text": "Harriet Baskas\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe world’s first and only revolving glass floor is now suspended and spinning – slowly – at the 500-foot level of Seattle’s iconic, 605-foot-tall space-age inspired Space Needle.\n\nDubbed “The Loupe” (a reference to the magnifying devices jewelers and watchmakers use), the Space Needle’s rotating glass floor is located just below the open-air observation deck and replaces the original (nonglass) revolving floor that was a feature of the Space Needle’s restaurant when it first opened at the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair.\n\nVisitors can walk, stand, sit or stretch out on the new floor and look down on the Space Needle’s architecture, the elevators and the elevator counterweights, the Seattle Center campus (an urban park with several museums and other attractions) and the city.\n\nThe mechanics of the rotating glass floor – or turntable – are also visible and include 12 motors and 48 rollers that can complete a rotation in varying lengths of time, from a quick 20 minutes to a glacial 90 minutes in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.\n\n“The original revolving floor in the restaurant went clockwise for one rotation in 47 minutes,” said Karen Olson, chief marketing officer for the Space Needle, “So we’re going to start this with one clockwise rotation every 45 minutes and see if we need to adjust it from there.”\n\nIn May, the Space Needle marked another milestone in its $100 million makeover, with the unveiling of the first batch of specially slanted clear glass benches on the outdoor Observation Deck at the 520-foot level.\n\nNow all 24 benches, dubbed “Skyrisers,” are attached to some of the viewing deck’s newly installed 11-foot-tall glass windows and invite visitors to lean back and snap selfies that will make them appear to be floating out over the landscape.\n\nOver the past year, while the Observation Deck remained open to the public, construction workers replaced the view-obstructing but structurally necessary half-wall and caging installed when the 605-foot-tall Space Needle was built — in just 400 days — as a centerpiece for the World’s Fair held in Seattle in 1962.\n\nMore:Seattle Space Needle makeover includes selfie-friendly glass benches\n\n“We needed to update some of the aging mechanical and electrical systems in this 56-year-old building originally designed to look like a flying saucer on a stick,” Olson said. “And we figured, while we’re up there, let’s update the experience and expand the view.”\n\nSeattle-based design firm Olson Kundig, the project architect, maintained the landmark features of the building while significantly opening up the Observation Deck view with 48 floor-to-ceiling glass windows that are each 7 feet wide and 11 feet high.\n\nThe group also added direct viewing lines to the outside for everyone who steps off the elevator, a state-of-the art ADA lift that (finally) makes the outdoor deck fully accessible, an indoor café and the newly unveiled inclined glass “Skyrisers” that will make a trip to the top of the Space Needle super selfie-worthy.\n\nMore on the world’s first rotating glass floor\n\nWhen the Space Needle opened at the Seattle World’s Fair in 1962, it featured a rotating restaurant on the 500-foot level, just below the Observation Deck, that operated on a turntable powered first by a 1-horsepower and, later, a 1.5-horsepower motor. (While novel, it wasn’t the world’s first rotating restaurant. That honor goes to a restaurant that operated in the Ala Moana shopping mall in Hawaii.)\n\nOver the years there have been three different restaurant concepts in the rotating space, and this fall plans for the fourth restaurant will be announced. For now, there’s a wine bar.\n\nInspired by the (nonrotating) glass floor the Eiffel Tower opened in 2014 and by the glass floors at Chicago’s Willis Tower and the Grand Canyon Skywalk, the rotating glass floor at the Space Needle offers visitors a view down at the fountain, the green spaces and museums on the 74-acre Seattle Center grounds.\n\nPlanning a visit\n\nAdmission to the Space Needle’s upper and lower observation decks ranges by time of day from $27.50 to $37.50 for adults, with discounts for seniors and kids. Discounted admission may be available with bundled attraction passes or some auto club and other organization memberships.\n\nWhen to go: More than 1.3 million people visit the Space Needle each year, and lines can be especially long during the busy summer tourist season. Consider purchasing a timed-entry ticket online and visiting first thing in the morning or at the end of the evening. Summer hours: 8 a.m. to midnight.\n\nTo get a unique view of the iconic 605-foot-tall Space Needle, plan a visit to the Sky View Observatory on the 73rd floor of the Columbia Tower in downtown Seattle. At nearly 1,000 feet, the observatory is the tallest public viewing area in the Pacific Northwest.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/03"}]}

After hiking the rate from near zero since March 2022 to wrestle down high inflation, the central bank has stood pat since July as consumer price increases moderated substantially.\n\nWednesday’s move means Americans will keep paying higher borrowing costs for now as the Fed battles to slow sharp price increases.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed repeated that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation (now close to 3%) is moving sustainably toward” the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nWhat's ahead for homebuyers?Mortgage rates at a 'new normal' of 6%.\n\nHow much will interest rates drop?\n\nWhile inflation has eased more slowly early this year, Fed officials maintained their projection that they’ll lower the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% by year’s end, according to their median estimate. That’s equivalent to three quarter-point rate cuts, an outlook that could further bolster a stock market that has hit new records since fall on the prospect of lower rates.\n\nAt a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that inflation flared in early 2024 after falling dramatically last year. But he said the uptick in January could have been caused by challenges the government faces as it seasonally adjusts the data. The February data was more worrisome, he said, but it appeared to show less of a spike than the previous month.\n\n\"The story is really essentially the same of inflation coming down gradually to 2% on a sometimes bumpy path,\" Powell said. \"We're not going to overreact...to the two months of data. Nor are we going to ignore them.\"\n\nPowell wasn't more specific on when the Fed could start shaving rates except to reiterate that it likely will be \"sometimes this year.\" He noted, however, that besides further progress on inflation, Fed officials also could lower rates \"if there's a significant weakening in the labor market.\"\n\nFutures markets continue to predict three rate decreases this year, with the first coming in June.\n\nSome economists believe the Fed will slice rates more sharply this year in response to both a softening economy and slowing inflation.\n\n\"We continue to believe that below-potential GDP growth will help to drive core inflation much closer to the 2% target by year-end, persuading the Fed to cut rates by (a full percentage point), beginning in June,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients..\n\nFed officials did reduce their forecast to just three rate cuts in 2025 from four in December. And they nudged up their estimate of the longer-run rate intended to neither stimulate nor curb growth to 2.6% from 2.5%, indicating they believe the economy will be a bit stronger than anticipated in coming years.\n\nHow's the job market?Behind the rosy job numbers, Americans are struggling to find work\n\nThe Fed raises rates to make consumer and business borrowing more expensive in an effort to curtail economic activity and inflation. It lowers rates to stimulate weak growth or dig the economy out of recession. Wednesday’s decision means consumers will continue to endure higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, auto and other loans but will also benefit from higher savings account yields.\n\nSome Fed officials say they can afford to trim rates cautiously because the economy has been resilient despite the high borrowing costs and inflation is still above their goal. Others note that with price gains generally slowing, inflation-adjusted rates are already too high and serve as a drag on an economy that’s poised to lose steam after a post-COVID surge.\n\nSome forecasters still think the U.S. could slip into a mild recession this year, an outcome they say would become more likely if the Fed waits too long to chop rates.\n\nWhat is the prediction for the economy in 2024?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed said it expects the economy to grow 2.1% in 2024, well above its prior 1.4% estimate. It predicts 2% growth in 2025, up from its prior 1.8% projection.\n\nThe economy grew a sturdy 3.1% in 2023 (as measured from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023). But it’s projected to slow this year as high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling COVID-related savings take a bigger toll on household spending. Retail sales were feeble in January and February.\n\nStubborn inflation:Inflation data from CPI report shows sharper price gains.\n\nWhat is the forecast inflation rate for 2024?\n\nFed officials estimate their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, will end 2024 at its current level. 2.4%, in line with their previous projection.\n\nBut a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and is watched more closely by the Fed is expected to dip from 2.8% to 2.6% by the end of the year, above the prior 2.4% estimate.\n\nAfter hitting a 40-year high of 7% in mid-2022, the PCE price index has tumbled. Economists point to the resolution of product and labor shortages as Americans idled by COVID came back to the labor force, joining a stream of immigrants. Also, consumer demand for furniture and other goods has softened as the health crisis has faded.\n\nBut in January, consumer prices rose 0.3% and a core measure both jumped 0.4%, higher than the previous trend. The increases still lowered annual inflation overall to 2.4% and core PCE to 2.8%.\n\nIn February, though, a different inflation gauge, the consumer price index (CPI), along with core CPI, both rose 0.4%, according to a report last week. The cost of services such as rent, auto insurance, car repairs and airline fares continued to climb. And prices for goods that had been falling or rising modestly, such as used cars and clothing, drifted higher.\n\nEconomists are divided over whether the high inflation readings amount to a blip or a sign that the road to the Fed’s 2% target is becoming bumpier. Barclays economist Jonathan Millar believes the fall in goods prices may have petered out. And annual wage growth, which was propelled higher by pandemic-related worker shortages, could decline just gradually, leaving services inflation elevated, he says.\n\nGregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon, says the inflation readings for the past two months have been distorted by volatile items such as airfares. And, he says, pay increases should continue to slow steadily, bringing inflation close to the Fed’s 2% target by year’s end.\n\nWhat happened to the American Dream?How younger workers are redefining success\n\nWhat will the job market look like in 2024?\n\nThe 3.9% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 at 4%, a bit lower than the December forecast, the Fed’s median estimate shows. Average monthly job growth has downshifted from about 300,000 in early 2023 to a still robust 264,000 the past three months. But average job gains are likely to slow to less than 100,000 by mid-year, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nMeanwhile, average yearly wage gains have declined to 4.3% from 5.9% since March 2022. The Fed wants pay increases to come down to 3.5% to align with its 2% inflation target.\n\nFor more answers to your questions about today's interest rate decision and its impact, keep reading:\n\nWhy is the Fed slow to cut rates?\n\nThe Fed’s cautious approach illustrates what’s unusual about this round of potential rate cuts.\n\nVincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus-Mellon and a former Fed economist, notes that the Fed typically cuts rates quickly as the economy deteriorates in an often-futile effort to prevent a recession.\n\nBut this time, the economy is still healthy. The Fed is considering rate cuts only because inflation has steadily fallen from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. As a result, it is approaching rate cuts the way it usually does rate hikes: Slowly and methodically while trying to divine the economy’s direction from often-conflicting data.\n\n“The Fed is driving events, not events driving the Fed,” Reinhart said. “That’s why this task is different than others.”\n\n- Associated Press\n\nWill Fed rate cuts lift Americans?Fed interest-rate cuts are likely coming but may not offer much relief\n\nAre other countries’ central banks cutting rates?\n\nLike the Fed, other major central banks are keeping rates high to ensure that they have a firm handle on consumer price spikes. In Europe, pressure is building to lower borrowing costs as inflation drops and economic growth has stalled, unlike in the United States. The European Central Bank’s leader hinted this month that a possible rate cut wouldn’t come until June, while the Bank of England isn’t expected to open the door to any imminent cut at its meeting Thursday.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nWhat happened at the last FOMC meeting?\n\nDuring the last Federal Reserve meeting in January, the Fed underscored that an interest rate cut was now far more likely than a hike. But the central bank also suggested that it’s in no rush to reduce rates and wants to make sure inflation has been subdued for the long term before acting.\n\n\"The timing of (the first rate decrease) is linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2%,\" Powell said at a January news conference. \"I don't think it is likely (Fed officials) will reach that level of confidence by the time of the March meeting. It's probably not the most likely case.\"\n\n- Paul Davidson, Daniel de Visé, Medora Lee, Charisse Jones and Bailey Schulz\n\nIs the Federal Reserve a government agency?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is an “independent government agency.” It does not get funding through Congress. Rather, its income is primarily based on interest from the government securities it owns.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nBitcoin value today\n\nThe value of a single Bitcoin was $63,355.24, as of 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, down from $73,835.57 on March 14 which was the cryptocurrency’s highest intraday price in the past year.\n\n- USA TODAY/Blueprint\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other to borrow overnight. If that rate increases, banks usually pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow as rates rise on credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. That’s why the funds rate is the key mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to calm inflation.\n\nSimply put, companies and consumers don’t borrow as much when loans cost them more, and that means an overheated economy can cool and inflation may dip.\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nConsumer Price Index: What is it?\n\nIn February, the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI) – a measure of the average shift in prices for a basket of different products and services – was up 3.2% from a year earlier, a slightly larger annual increase than the month before.\n\nAnnual inflation is down dramatically from 9.1% in June 2022, which marked a 40-year high. But it remains above the 2% target the Fed equates with price stability.\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it takes into account for its interest rate decisions. The CPI is one key measure the Fed looks at to help determine if prices are “stable.’’ It traditionally has watched PCE prices even more closely.\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices don’t include the volatile costs of food and energy items, giving a more accurate gauge of longer-term trends.\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nIs there a recession coming in 2024?\n\nNow that inflation is easing, the Fed may be poised to make a blunder by moving too slowly to cut rates and triggering a recession, some economists argue.\n\n“The longer they wait, the greater the risk that something goes off the rails,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.\n\nOther economists say inflation still poses the bigger threat and the Fed is on the right track.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nEthereum price\n\nEthereum topped $4,000 at the start of this month, its highest peak since December 2021. The cryptocurrency is the second-largest based on market capitalization.\n\n- USA TODAY/Blueprint\n\nDoes the Federal Reserve interest rate affect credit cards?\n\nThe Fed doesn’t directly dictate how much interest you pay on your credit card debt. But its rate is the basis for your bank’s prime rate. In combination with other factors, such as your credit score, the prime rate helps determine the Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, on your credit card.\n\nCredit card annual percentage rates (APRs), or the annual interest rates you pay to borrow money, will likely continue climbing. The average credit card interest rate is 24.66%, the highest since LendingTree began tracking rates monthly in 2019, it said.\n\n“We’ll likely see more record credit card APRs in the short term, with rates for those who don’t have perfect credit perhaps climbing the most,” said Matt Schulz, credit analyst at comparison site LendingTree. “I expect the increases to be pretty small, barring unexpectedly bad economic news, but after two years of upward movement, even tiny increases are definitely unwelcome.”\n\nWith interest rates so high, Americans should focus on paying off credit card debt before anything else. “You can’t outrun 20-plus-percent interest rate on a balance,” said Rich Guerrini, president and chief executive at financial services company PNC Investments.\n\nSince it’s tax season, consider using your refund check to pay off credit card debt, he said. As of March 8, the average refund was $3,145, up 5.8% from a year ago, the IRS said. “Use it to pay your credit card bill instead of a trip,” Guerrini said.\n\nCredit card debt was a record $1.13 trillion in the last three months of 2023 and delinquencies have risen above pre-pandemic levels, the New York Federal Reserve said.\n\n- Associated Press, Medora Lee\n\nWill auto loan rates go down in 2024?\n\nBorrowers’ rates are based on factors like credit background, vehicle price, down payment and the lenders’ borrowing costs and risks.\n\nBut rates alone have “a pretty limited impact on affordability,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at personal finance site Bankrate. “For most auto buyers, it’s not the interest rate that’s busting the budget...The difference between 8% and 7.25% on a $40,000 loan is about $14 per month – on an $800 per month loan.”\n\nInstead, it’s price. The average new vehicle transaction price remains 18% higher than pre-pandemic, Kelley Blue Book said.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow does the Fed's decision affect savings interest rates?\n\nRates have already begun to fall in anticipation of a rate cut later this year, said Ken Tumin, banking expert at DepositAccounts.com, which tracks interest rate products.\n\nCertificates of Deposit (CD) rates have led the decline, with some banks having already slashed their 12-month online CD rate by more than half a percentage point this year, he said.\n\nOnline savings accounts have fared better, with rates holding mostly steady or just dipping.\n\n“Widespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,” Tumin said. So far in 2024, the average yield has declined 5 basis points from 4.49% to 4.44%, he said.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nCertificate of Deposit: Average CD rates today\n\nThe average yield on a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) in December 2023 was 1.86%, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), while a 60-month CD was 1.40%.\n\nWhile those rates aren’t exactly robust, they’re well above recent levels. For instance, a one-year CD yielded just 0.13% in January 2022, before the Fed started raising rates, while a 60-month CD offered only 0.28%.\n\nA rate increase of that size can make a big difference to your bottom line.\n\nSay you opened a 60-month CD and deposited $10,000 in January 2022 that paid a 0.28% APY. After five years, you’d earn just a little more than $140 in interest.\n\nThat same $10,000 would net nearly $700 now.\n\n- USA TODAY/Blueprint\n\nHigh-yield savings account rates\n\nSome of the top high-yield savings accounts currently feature rates of 4% or higher.\n\nA high-yield account works much like a regular savings account. You open the account and then deposit and withdraw funds when you want to, within what the rules allow. The biggest difference you may see between a traditional and a high-yield account is that a larger amount of interest is earned and deposited into your account at the end of each month.\n\nThe rate is subject to change depending on the overall financial market and the business needs of the bank or credit union.\n\n- USA TODAY/Blueprint\n\nHELOC rates today\n\nThe Fed's rate moves also influence what borrowers pay on variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which are revolving lines of credit that give homeowners a flexible way to borrow against the equity they’ve built up in their homes. Similar to a credit card, you can repeatedly borrow from your credit line and will only pay back the amount you’ve drawn. You’ll also only pay interest on what you’ve actually borrowed.\n\nHELOCs can be used for almost any purpose, from home improvement projects or debt consolidation to college tuition or emergency expenses.\n\nThe average rate on a $100,000 HELOC is 9.14% if you have a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 60%, 9.29% if your LTV ratio is 80% and 10.02% with a 90% LTV ratio.\n\n- USA TODAY/Blueprint\n\nWhen is the next Federal Reserve meeting?\n\nHere are the upcoming Fed meetings planned for this year:\n\nApril 30-May 1\n\nJune 11-12\n\nJuly 30-31\n\nSept. 17-18\n\nNov. 6-7\n\nDec. 17-18\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nFed prime rate today\n\nThe prime rate tends to be three percentage points above the federal funds rate, which is the interest tacked on to overnight loans between banks.

That still lowered the annual increase from 2.9% the previous month to 2.8%. Overall prices rose 2.4% from a year earlier, down from 2.6% and the smallest increase in nearly three years.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nThe seven-member Board of Governors is the governing body of the Federal Reserve System.

Over time, the cumulative impact of lower rates could be more substantial.\n\nThe Fed influences, but does not control, mortgage rates. If you’ve found a nice, affordable home, that shouldn’t stop you from buying it, some experts say.\n\n“You can always buy a house and refinance later if rates fall,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist and investment adviser at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow does this affect my plans to buy a house?\n\nWith the Fed now expected to delay rate cuts, some prospective home buyers may follow suit, some experts say.\n\n“Unfortunately for the housing market, a decision to stay the course will likely result in a softer spring selling season,” said Dan Burnett, head of investor product at fintech Hometap, which offers home equity investment products.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate has recently risen above 7% again, reversing its steady decline since October.\n\n“Homeowners sitting on mortgage rates well below market are unlikely to sell, and prospective homebuyers staring down exorbitant monthly payments seem willing to wait,” Burnett said.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nMortgage rates today\n\nAs of March 19, the average annual percentage rate (APR) for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.40%. That was a slight dip from the 7.49% one month ago. But it was far above the 5.8% some home buyers were able to get in late 2022.\n\nThe average APR for a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.64% — a tick down from 6.71% in February.\n\n- USA TODAY Staff\n\nWhat are the current interest rates?\n\nSince March 2022, the Fed has hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero to a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to tame inflation. With its preferred yearly inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – falling swiftly from a 40-year high of 7%, the Fed has paused since July.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nFOMC Press Conference:Watch live at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nStock market today\n\nU.S. stocks are edging higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it’s still likely to deliver the cuts to interest rates this year that Wall Street craves, even though concerns are growing about stubbornly high inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.6% higher at 2:47 p.m. ET after flipping between tiny gains and losses before the Fed’s announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite was 0.9% higher.\n\n10-year Treasury yield\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields had a mixed reaction.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for Fed action, initially jumped before quickly giving up the gain. It was recently at 4.64%, down from 4.69% late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes into account longer-term economic growth and inflation, initially tumbled after the Fed’s announcement but then rose. It was recently at 4.29%, compared with 4.30% late Tuesday.\n\n- Associated Press and USA TODAY Staff\n\nHow will the stock market react to ‘higher for longer’?\n\nThe stock market response to the Fed's announcement will depend on details of the message, not the expected hold on rates.\n\n“Investors are going to look at the FOMC statement, Chair Powell’s press conference, and the FOMC dot plots for clues as to what the future path of monetary policy might look like,” said BeiChen Lin, strategist at Russell Investments.\n\nBut with so much optimism for avoiding recession, slower inflation and lower interest rates already priced into stocks with their recent record highs, “it’s hard to come up with another catalyst for a sharp upward move higher from here,” Lin said. “Even a minor unpleasant surprise in the economic data could cause a pullback. We think investors should avoid playing the momentum game, and instead stay close to their strategic allocation to equities.”\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nFed rate cuts 2024\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month the central bank won’t begin cutting its key interest rate “until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward” its 2% goal, noting the move will likely occur “at some point this year.”Responding to questions from members of the House Financial Services Committee, Powell added, \"because the economy has been so strong we think we can and should be careful\" about slicing rates. He added the Fed wants \"to see more good inflation readings\" to feel confident that the recent pullback in price gains won't stall or reverse.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nDid the latest jobs report affect the Fed’s plans?\n\nThe latest jobs report showed the country adding a robust 275,000 jobs in February.\n\nEconomists said this doesn’t change expectations that the Fed will probably start cutting interest rates in June, with the booming February job gains offset by the downgrades for previous months and a rising unemployment rate.More significantly, yearly pay increases, which feed into inflation, dipped, giving the Fed some assurance that price increases should continue to slow.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\n\nTraditionally, the Fed reduces interest rates to jolt an economy that’s slowing significantly or already in recession. Right now, however, neither of those things is happening. The economy grew a sturdy 3.3% in the fourth quarter and a solid 2.5% for all of 2023, as consumer spending stayed strong.\n\nInstead, the Fed tentatively plans to lower rates because inflation has eased. Otherwise, over time, inflation-adjusted rates would be too high and excessively restrain consumer and business spending.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nSubscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.

It marks just the second meeting at which the Fed hasn’t raised its federal funds rate since it began its hiking campaign in March 2022.\n\nHow high will interest rates really go?\n\nFed policymakers estimate they’ll nudge up the federal funds rate by another quarter percentage point this year to a range of 5.5% to 5.75% in 2023, similar to their median forecast in June. Financial markets and many economists don’t buy it. They expect the Fed to stand pat the rest of the year because of signs the job market and inflation are cooling.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nWhat did Powell say today?\n\nAt a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed the Fed has made no decision about whether to lift rates again and is in no rush to do so.\n\n\"Given how far we've come, we are in a position to proceed carefully,\" he said.\n\nPowell said he's pleased with how much inflation has come down but officials want to see a more sustained decline before concluding they can keep rates steady.\n\n\"We want to see convincing evidence that we've reached the appropriate level\" of interest rates, he said. Noting that inflation has fallen encouragingly since May, he added, \"We want to see that for more than just three months.\"\n\nBy next year, Fed officials predict they’ll cut the rate to 5% to 5.25%, higher than the 4.5% to 4.75% they projected in June as they expect the economy to remain resilient and inflation to drift down just gradually. That means officials likely will start trimming rates later in 2024 than they had predicted.\n\n\"Economic activity has been stronger than we expected,\" Powell said in explaining why officials are forecasting fewer rate cuts next year. That, he said, \"means we have to do more with rates.\"\n\nHe clarified, though, that a robust economy itself wouldn't lead the Fed to raise rates further unless officials believe the stronger growth would spark another inflation spike.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed repeated that “in determining the extent of additional (rate increases) that may be appropriate” to lower inflation to the Fed’s 2% goal, it will assess the lags with which its rate hikes affect the economy, inflation and economic and financial developments.\n\nMorgan Stanley had predicted the Fed would remove the word “additional,” hinting it’s less likely to bump up rates again this year.\n\nThe Fed also upgraded its view of the economy, saying it has been expanding at a “solid” pace compared to its prior description of a “moderate” pace. It noted that “job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong.”\n\nOfficials are struggling to take the measure of an economy and job market that are downshifting but holding up remarkably well despite rising prices and interest rates. Inflation, meanwhile, is slowing though not as rapidly as policymakers would prefer.\n\nGoldman Sachs says those developments should herald an ideal scenario in which the Fed can halt its rate hikes – helping avoid a recession ‒ as moderating rent increases in coming months cause inflation to pull back more swiftly.\n\nBut Barclays believes another rate increase is likely because officials want to see more decisive evidence that inflation is moving closer to 2% and worry that COVID-related labor shortages and a healthy labor market could continue to spur strong wage growth that feeds into prices.\n\nBy 2024, contrary to the Fed's forecasts, several top economists reckon officials will be more worried about a flagging economy than stubbornly high inflation.\n\n\"We expect the real economy to be considerably weaker and that core inflation will fall much more quickly, which will persuade the Fed to cut rates more aggressively next year,\" says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nWednesday’s decision to stand pat provides a reprieve to consumers who have faced steady rate increases for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. Yet Americans, especially seniors, are finally seeing healthy bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nWill inflation slow down soon?\n\nFed officials expect their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, to hold steady at 3.3% by year-end, slightly above their June estimate, according to their median forecast. By the end of 2024, consumer price increases are expected to drop to 2.5%, still somewhat higher than the Fed’s 2% benchmark.\n\nA core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed follows more closely is expected to close out the year at 3.7%, below the prior 3.9% estimate.\n\nSince summer 2022, inflation has fallen substantially. But in August, gasoline costs drove prices sharply higher and core inflation picked up as prices for rent, travel and other services accelerated, according to a different inflation gauge called the consumer price index.\n\nHow much will the economy grow this year?\n\nFed officials expect the economy to grow at a 2.1% annual rate this year, faster than their 1% projection in June, and 1.5% next year, above their prior 1.1% estimate.\n\nThe economy expanded a solid 2.1% in the second quarter and is projected to grow as much as 4% in the July-September period before slowing sharply later this year. The resumption of student loan payments suspended during COVID, a possible government shutdown and auto strikes will likely hamper growth, Goldman says.\n\nConsumer spending has stayed strong despite high prices and borrowing costs now that average pay increases are finally outpacing inflation. But the student loan payments and the depletion of households’ pandemic-related savings are likely to take a bigger toll on consumption, economists say.\n\nWill the job market slow down in 2023?\n\nThe historically low 3.8% unemployment rate is projected to end the year at that level, below the 4.1% previously forecast. It’s projected to climb to 4.1% by the end of 2024.\n\nU.S. employers have added an average of 150,000 jobs a month since June. That’s half the pace recorded early this year but still solid. There are 1.5 job openings per unemployed American – down from two openings earlier in the year but still well above a balanced market of one vacancy per jobless worker.\n\nAnnual wage growth has fallen to 4.3% from 5.9% in March. Barclays notes, however, that the pace remains higher than the 3.5% needed to lower inflation to 2%.\n\nIn a speech last month at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials could raise rates again if the economy and job market don’t weaken more substantially.\n\nBut he also said the Fed will move \"carefully\" as it weighs raising rates enough to lower inflation against going too far and tipping the economy into recession.\n\nWant to know more about interest rates, inflation, and the economy? Keep reading.\n\nCOLA 2024\n\nThose who receive Social Security will likely see their cost of living adjustment (COLA) bump up by 3.2% next year according to a new forecast made in the wake of last week’s report showing inflation increased in August. That’s higher than the previous estimate of 3%.\n\nWhile inflation has inched up each of the last two months and is hovering above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, the rate of price hikes has generally been dropping over the last year, which means the benefits adjustment is minimal, according to estimates from The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group.\n\nStill, the updated increase would be higher than the 2.6% average seen over the past twenty years though far lower than the four-decade COLA high of 8.7% that Social Security recipients got in 2023.\n\n“The harsh reality is that the amount that the COLAs increase benefits in most years is meager at best,” said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League.\n\nIs there any way to benefit from higher interest rates?\n\nYes. If you’re saving money in fixed-income assets, you’re probably getting a higher return on that money. The interest paid out on savings accounts, Treasuries and CDs has risen as the Fed has raised rates.\n\nHowever, not all fixed-income assets are the same, warns banking expert Ken Tumin at DepositAccounts.com. Look here to find out what types of returns are available:\n\nTraditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts pay the least, around 0.45%.\n\nOnline savings accounts yield an average 4.39%, with the highest at 5.30%.\n\nMoney market mutual funds (MMFs) yields are higher, some near 5.27%.\n\nSome 7-month and 13-month CD Specials pay 4.75% to 5.00% APY, respectively.\n\nOnline longer-term CDs may not give as good a return, with the average online 5-year CD yield having dropped this year to 3.95% on September 1 from 4.04% on January 1.\n\nCar payment calculator, mortgage payment calculator\n\nRising interest rates have contributed to the boost in auto loan prices and mortgage rates. You can calculate your car and mortgage payments on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ website.\n\nS&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500, the broadest stock market gauge index used to benchmark many mutual funds, dipped 0.94% Wednesday to 4,402.20.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stock market index of 30 large companies, ended the day down 0.22% at 34,440.88.\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\nThe Nasdaq composite – a stock market index that includes almost all of the stocks listed on the exchange – dropped 1.53% Wednesday to 13,469.13.\n\n10-year Treasury yield\n\nThe Fed’s actions have pumped up the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a guide for setting interest on an average 30-year mortgage. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Wednesday reached levels not seen since 2007, up 0.03 percentage points at 4.399%.\n\nFed interest rates chart\n\nWhat is hyperinflation?\n\nHyperinflation is when prices increase at very high rates. There’s no official threshold, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nWhile the U.S. inflation rate hit 9.1% in June of 2022, this was not considered hyperinflation. (In one example of hyperinflation seen in Zimbabwe, the inflation rate was over 20,000%, according to the St. Louis Fed.)\n\nFederal Reserve System definition\n\nThe Federal Reserve System, also referred to as the Federal Reserve or Fed, is the central bank of the United States.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of the Federal Reserve?\n\nThe Fed's responsibibilities include:\n\nInfluencing money and credit conditions to help create jobs, stabilize prices and moderate long-term interest rates.\n\nRegulating banks and other financial institutions.\n\nMaintaining the financial system’s stability and containing systematic risk.\n\nProviding financial services to the U.S. government, U.S. financial institutions and foreign official institutions.\n\nHelping operate and oversee the country’s payments systems.\n\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created by Congress in 1913, according to the Fed's website. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law that year “to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system.”\n\nWhere is the Federal Reserve located?\n\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve banks located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. The board is headquartered in Washington, D.C.\n\nWho controls the Federal Reserve?\n\nThe governing body of the Federal Reserve System is the seven-member Board of Governors. Each governor is nominated by the U.S. president and their positions are confirmed by the Senate. Their terms are staggered and last 14 years.\n\nThe chair is also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but his or her term is only four years long. Jerome Powell is the current chair.\n\nEach member of the board serves on the FOMC, which is the body within the Fed that sets the monetary policy.\n\nU.S. inflation rate by month\n\nThe inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\nJune 2022: 9.1%\n\nJuly 2022: 8.5%\n\nAugust 2022: 8.3%\n\nSeptember 2022: 8.2%\n\nOctober 2022: 7.7%\n\nNovember 2022: 7.1%\n\nDecember 2022: 6.5%\n\nJanuary 2023: 6.4%\n\nFebruary 2023: 6.0%\n\nMarch 2023: 5.0&\n\nApril 2023: 4.9%\n\nMay 2023: 4.0%\n\nJune 2023: 3.0%\n\nJuly 2023: 3.2%\n\nAugust 2023: 3.7%\n\nWill my credit card debt be affected?\n\nThe average APR on a new credit card offer is 24.45%, the highest since at least 2019 when LendingTree began tallying this data, and likely to continue creeping higher in the next few months, said Matt Schulz, LendingTree credit industry analyst.\n\nIf you have $5,000 in debt on a card with a 24.45% APR, and a $250 monthly payment, you’ll pay $1,487 in interest and take 26 months to pay off the balance.\n\nFor those who carry a credit card balance over month to month, the average APR is a record 22.16%, according to Fed data. That’s up from 16.17% in the first three months of 2022 when the Fed began raising rates.\n\nSomeone with $5,000 in credit card debt on a card with a 22.16% APR and a $250 monthly payment would pay $1,298 in interest and take 26 months to pay off the balance.\n\nIf you’re in this boat, having to pay down debt amid soaring rates, take steps now to mitigate the pain. For example, take advantage of 0% balance transfer credit cards or ask your issuer for a lower APR. More than 3 out of 4 cardholders who asked for a lower APR for their credit card in the past year got one, Schulz said. The average reduction was about 6 percentage points, which could save you $500 or more depending on how much you owe, he said.\n\nWhen is the next Fed meeting for 2023?\n\nThe Fed’s 2023 meeting schedule is:\n\nSept. 19-20\n\nOct. 31-Nov. 1\n\nDec. 12-13\n\nWhat’s the unemployment rate?\n\nThe jobless rate ticked up to 3.8% in August, the highest since February 2022. And there were 110,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in June and July than first reported, showing that the jobs market was not as robust as initially believed.\n\nStill, August’s bump in unemployment, which increased from 3.5% the month before, reflected an influx of more people who were looking for work. And the U.S. had 187,000 more jobs in August than in July, according to a separate survey, the Labor Department said.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nIn August, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‒ a gauge of the average change in prices for various products and services ‒ was 3.7%, an increase largely spurred by a spike in the cost of gas.\n\nGas prices increased 10.6% though they were 3.3% lower than a year earlier and far below the $5 peak also reached in 2022. And filling up your tank isn’t likely to get cheaper any time soon as the global economic forecast becomes more upbeat and OPEC continues to decrease oil production.\n\nFood prices were also up in August, though not by as much, rising 0.3% in August. The price of bacon increased 4%, while chicken cost 1.3% more.\n\nSome staples however became more affordable. The price of eggs, for instance, was inflated for months for reasons related to the bird-flu. But in August, egg prices dropped 2.5%. It was the sixth monthly price dip in a row.\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve keeps its eye on two primary aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it considers for its interest-rate decisions. The CPI is a key measure the Fed looks at to help determine if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices don’t count food and energy items, whose costs tend to be volatile, giving a more accurate assessment of longer-term trends.\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nA recession is \"a significant decline in economic activity that spreads across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\" according to Michael Pugliese, an economist with Wells Fargo.\n\nThe nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, which designates when a recession occurred, takes many indicators into account, including the unemployment rate, consumer spending, retail sales and industrial production.\n\nThe last two recessions occurred when the economy was jolted by a housing crisis in 2008/2009 and then the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which led to massive layoffs as many businesses faltered or were forced to close when people hunkered down in their homes.\n\nMany feared that the U.S. would tip into a recession because of the aggressive rate hikes initiated by the Federal Reserve to cool an economy that rapidly ramped up as the pandemic eased. But the economy has remained surprisingly strong as consumers continue to spend and payrolls grow, and fears of a recession are waning.\n\nWill we have a recession?\n\nThe odds appear to increasingly be, no. But some areas of the country are more vulnerable than others.\n\nWith economic and job growth staying strong, the risk of a national recession by the middle of next year is receding. But the West and South, which saw prices surge during the pandemic as remote workers flocked to less crowded locales, are now more susceptible to price dips, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\n“There’s more risk in places that have grown rapidly,” says Moody’s regional economist Adam Kamins. “There’s a little more risk of a bubble forming.”\n\nWhy does the Fed raise interest rates?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate increases, banks are likely to pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive to borrow as rates increase on everything from credit cards to adjustable rate mortgages. That’s why the funds rate is the primary lever the Federal Reserve uses to slow inflation.\n\nBusinesses and consumers borrow less when loans cost more, and that means an overheated economy can cool down and the rate of price increases may decline.\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nInflation is a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank headquartered in Washington D.C.\n\nGoods ranging from gas to groceries to rent are all potentially affected by inflation. But it is the cumulative impact that dictates what the inflation rate actually is.\n\n\"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount,\" Bivens said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s inflation target is 2%, which means businesses can boost prices by 2% annually and that won’t be a financial hardship for consumers. Cost of living increases for workers are also expected to meet that goal to make sure employees can keep up with the rising cost of products and services.\n\nDoes raising interest rates hurt the economy?\n\nIn the long run it does, according to at least two economics and finance professors who presented a paper on the issue at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last month.\n\nThe Fed’s aim when it boosts interest rates is to make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, cooling the economy and ultimately curbing inflation. But such moves can also stifle broader economic output and the potential for growth over the long term, the paper said.\n\nWhen will inflation go down?\n\nInflation has come down significantly since it reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. But the rate of price hikes has remained stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% goal. That’s partly because while the prices of some products have dipped, and the supply chain snags that emerged during the pandemic have mostly cleared, fixing a car, leisure activities and other services have become more expensive, largely due to rising wages.\n\nWhat causes inflation?\n\nMany different factors can lead to inflation. Most typically, it results from \"a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services,\" said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nThat means more people are spending money on products or services that are in short supply given the demand, leading producers to boost prices.\n\n\"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things,\" Bivens said. \"But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up.\"\n\nToo few producers can also spur a bout of inflation. A shortage of workers to deliver the desired products and services can also spark a hike in prices, Bivens said.\n\nFinally, there’s also a level of \"built-in inflation\" within economies, with central banks like the Fed wanting inflation to stay at a certain level. In the U.S., that goal is 2%, meaning businesses can boost prices by 2% annually, and that shouldn’t be a hardship for consumers. That’s also the typical range for cost of living boosts by employers.\n\nCD interest rate calculator\n\nWhile higher interest rates hurt borrowers, the opposite is true for savers who can actually earn a little more for their money.\n\nThe interest paid out on everything from savings accounts to CDs to Treasuries has risen as the Fed has raised rates. When it comes to CDs, here’s the interest rate rundown from banking expert Ken Tumin at DepositAccounts.com.\n\nSome 7-month and 13-month CD Specials pay 4.75% to 5.00% APY, respectively. However, remember: “These can be a good deal for savers, but savers have to make sure to close the CD Special at maturity.” Tumin said. “Typically, CD Specials will auto-renew into a low-rate standard CD. If the customer misses the grace period at maturity, their funds will be locked into a low-rate standard CD,” which can be much less lucrative.\n\nOnline longer-term CDs may not be as worthwhile, with the average online 5-year CD yield having fallen this year to 3.95% on September 1 from 4.04% on January 1.\n\nTraditional savings account typical interest\n\nThe typical interest on a traditional brick-and-mortar savings account is roughly 0.45%. That’s the lowest return among fixed-income assets.\n\nIs the Federal Reserve part of the government?\n\nYes. The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States.\n\nOil prices today\n\nThe cost of crude oil was down 1.02% Wednesday, closing at $90.27.\n\nStill, generally higher oil prices are pumping up the price of gas according to AAA, and in turn, gas was the primary driver of August’s higher inflation rate. Gas prices increased 10.6% last month though they were 3.3% lower than a year earlier and far below the $5 peak also reached in 2022.\n\n“Our findings suggest that monetary policy may affect the productive capacity of the economy in the longer term,” wrote Yueran Ma and Kaspar Zimmermann, economics and finance professors at the University of Chicago. “A slower pace of innovation may then have lasting effects.”\n\nFed rate hike history\n\nSince March 2022, the Fed has increased its benchmark federal funds rate 11 times, to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. It boosted the key rate at 10 meetings in a row - the steepest streak of rate hikes in four decades. It paused those increases in June but resumed in July with another quarter-point hike.\n\nInflation rate\n\nOverall, consumer prices increased 3.7% annually in August, the second straight monthly rise after annual inflation was on the decline 12 months in a row.\n\nA spike in gas prices was the main reason for the broader boost. Meanwhile, rising rents and increased costs to travel and to access other services were tempered by the shrinking prices of used cars, furniture and other products.\n\nMortgage rates: Will they be affected by Fed's rate decision?\n\nThe Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates. But they have pumped up the yield on the 10-year treasury bond, a guide for setting interest on an average 30-year loan, and that is helping fuel higher mortgage rates, according to experts.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been through the roof. During the last week of August, mortgage rates were 7.2%, the highest they’ve been in 21 years, according to Freddie Mac. The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hasn’t topped 7% since November 2022.\n\nFed dot plot\n\nIf you look at the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections report, you’ll find the Fed's dot plot. The dot plot is a visual representation of where individual Fed officials predict interest rates will be for years down the line. The dot plot was first created in late 2011 and was intended to add additional transparency to the Fed's decisions about monetary policy. In the latest dot plot, the majority of Fed officials indicated a target Fed funds rate between 4% to 4.75% would be appropriate for 2023. By 2024, they see rates going down to a range between 3% to 4%.\n\nWill Fed raise rates in September 2023?\n\nThere’s no change expected to the current key rate of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the hub of the nation’s banking system, working behind the scenes to make sure the economy is functioning and stable, and that there is a balance between the nation’s financial vitality and consumer interests. Its goal is “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates,’’ according to its website.\n\nCurrent Fed interest rate\n\nAfter a one month pause that interrupted the most significant flurry of interest rate hikes in four decades, the Fed resumed its increases in July, boosting the key rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. The Fed did not meet in August.\n\nFed speech today\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to speak at 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nInflation heats up again:At this Fed meeting, is an interest rate hike on the table?\n\nSocial Security:Social Security COLA 2024 prediction rises with latest CPI report, inflation data", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/12/13/fed-interest-rate-hike-live-updates/71896343007/", "title": "Fed holds rates steady as inflation eases, forecasts 3 cuts in 2024", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged again Wednesday, hinted that rate hikes are likely over and forecast three cuts next year amid falling inflation and a cooling economy.\n\nThat’s more rate cuts than many economists expected.\n\nThe decision leaves the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% following a flurry of rate increases aimed at subduing the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in four decades. The central bank has now held its key rate steady for three straight meetings since July.\n\nThat provides another reprieve for consumers who have faced higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans as a result of the Fed’s moves. Yet Americans, especially seniors, are finally reaping healthy bank savings yields after years of paltry returns.\n\nIn recent weeks, with inflation slowing more emphatically and the economy and job market cooling, talk has shifted from whether the Fed would hike again to how rapidly it will trim rates next year.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n401(k) boon:Stocks surge, Dow Jones hits all-time high at close after Fed forecasts lower rates\n\nLeaving savings behind:Many Americans are missing out on high-interest savings accounts. Don't be one of them\n\nWhere's economy going?:Is a soft landing in sight? What the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates are hinting at\n\nWill the Fed raise interest rates again?\n\nThe central bank didn’t rule out another rate increase as it downgraded its economic outlook for next year while lowering its inflation forecast. In a statement after a two-day meeting, it repeated that it would assess the economy and financial developments, among other factors, to determine “the extent of any additional (rate hikes) that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time.”\n\nBy adding the word “any,” however, Fed officials underscored there’s a reasonable chance it won’t have to raise rates again, though it stands ready to do so if necessary.\n\n'Not likely we will hike again'\n\n\"It's not likely we will hike again,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, noting the Fed's key rate is \"at or near its peak.\"\n\nBut he said the economy has surprised officials with its strength recently, adding that officials \"didn't want to take the possibility of additional hikes off the table.\"\n\nWill the Fed lower rates in 2024?\n\nPerhaps more significantly, Fed officials estimate they’ll lower the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% next year, according to their median estimate. That amounts to three quarter-point cuts, more than many economists expected and the number the Fed expected in September but fewer than the full percentage point drop that markets anticipated.\n\nSometimes, the Fed reduces rates to dig the economy out of a downturn. Next year, economists believe officials will cut simply to bring borrowing costs closer to normal as inflation eases. Otherwise, inflation-adjusted rates would rise.\n\n\"It's really good to see the progress we're making\" on inflation, Powell said. \"Inflation keeps coming down, the labor market keeps coming into balance. So far, so good.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is far too early to declare victory and there are certainly risks.\"\n\nSome economists say the Fed is still underestimating how quickly inflation will come down next year and how sharply it will slash rates.\n\n\"We're sticking to our view that the Fed will cut faster than this,\" with 1.5 percentage points in decreases, starting in March or May, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. \"We think inflation will fall faster than they expect.\"\n\nWhy is the 10-year Treasury yield falling?\n\nThe Fed may be reluctant to foresee too swift a rate decrease because of the market rally and recent drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.1%, developments that could strengthen the economy and inflation. When the Fed last met in early November, stocks were at a low point and the 10-year Treasury had reached 5% for the first time since 2007, driving up mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 1.37% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 1.4% following the Fed's signals that it's probably done lifting rates and is forecasting three cuts next year. The 10-year Treasury was down to about 4% from 4.21% on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Powell said high Treasury yields, if persistent, likely would constrain the economy and require fewer Fed rate increases,\n\nIn its statement Wednesday, however, the central bank didn’t acknowledge the recent decline in Treasury yields, suggesting yields are still relatively high and could spike again, crimping the economy.\n\n“Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,” the Fed said, repeating the language of its previous statement.\n\nIs inflation really slowing down?\n\nThe Fed’s middle-ground approach may have been cemented Tuesday by a mixed report on the consumer price index. The good news was that overall inflation barely budged in November amid falling gasoline prices, pushing down annual price gains to 3.1% from 3.2%, still well above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nBut a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed watches more closely rose a sturdy 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the yearly rise at 4%. That underlying measure could stay elevated for several months on climbing services costs, economists say.\n\nAnd while the Fed predicted Wednesday that inflation will slow a bit more rapidly than previously thought, it also expects the economy and job market to stay more resilient despite high inflation and interest rates. That could help the U.S. avoid a recession but it also boosts the risk of a resurgence in inflation, especially if the Fed slices rates too rapidly.\n\nWill inflation get better in 2024?\n\nFed officials expect their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, to fall from 3% in October to 2.4% at the end of 2024, below their 2.5% projection in September.\n\nThe core measure is expected to decline from 3.5% to 2.4% by the end of next year, below the prior 2.6% estimate.\n\nWhat is the economic forecast for 2024?\n\nThe Fed expect the economy to grow at a 2.6% annual rate, above its prior 2.1% estimate. But it predicts just 1.4% growth in 2024, down slightly from its prior 1.5% projection.\n\nThe economy grew a torrid 5.2% in the third quarter but growth is projected to slow to less than 2% late this year and in 2024 as high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling COVID-related savings crimp household spending.\n\nWill the job market get better in 2024?\n\nThe historically low 3.7% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 at 4.1%, in line with the September forecast. Average monthly job growth has downshifted from about 300,000 early this year to a still solid 200,000.\n\nAnd average yearly wage gains have tumbled to 4% from 5.9% since spring of last year. The Fed wants to lower pay increases to 3.5% to align with its 2% inflation target.\n\nBut Barclays says wage growth could decline more slowly now that a rebound in immigration may have peaked. Immigration moderates wage gains by expanding the labor supply.\n\nThat’s another potential reason for the Fed to be leery about cutting rates too quickly.\n\nWant to learn more?

It’s an illustration of where individual Fed officials forecast interest rates will be years down the line. The dot plot was first created in late 2011 and was meant to give more transparency to the Fed's decisions when it came to monetary policy.\n\nThe most recent forecast for the fund rate is 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year, and 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2024.\n\nHow is the U.S. economy doing?\n\nThe U.S. economy was strong in the third quarter as consumers continued to spend despite high interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe value of all services and products generated in the U.S., or GDP, rose at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% for the year in the months spanning July to September, according to the Commerce Department. That was more than twice the 2.1% increase in the previous quarter and the most aggressive pace of growth since the end of 2021 when the economy surged back from a recession sparked by the pandemic.\n\nHow likely is a recession in 2024?\n\nEconomists surveyed in September said there was a 48% chance the U.S. will slip into a recession over the next year, down from the 61% odds forecast in May.\n\nBarclays predicted a loss of roughly 375,000 jobs by the middle of next year. But consumer spending remains robust despite high inflation and interest rates that are making credit card use and consumer loans more expensive. And that may help stave off a recession, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nWhat does FOMC stand for?\n\nThe FOMC is the Federal Open Market Committee, the voting body responsible for setting interest rates. The 12-member committee includes seven members of the Board of Governors and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nWhat causes inflation?\n\nInflation can have many roots. Typically, it’s caused by \"a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services,\" said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nThat means more people are wanting items and services than there is adequate supply, leading producers to raise prices.\n\n\"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things,\" Bivens said. \"But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up.\"\n\nInflation can also happen when there are too few producers, or there aren’t enough employees to provide the coveted products and services, Bivens said.\n\nFinally, economies also have some \"built-in inflation\" to help keep inflation in check. In the U.S., that target is 2%, meaning businesses can raise prices 2% annually year and that shouldn’t overburden consumers. That’s also the typical cost of living raise offered by employers.\n\nInflation meaning\n\nInflation is the term for a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, head of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nEverything from food to rent can become costlier due to inflation. But it is the overall impact that determines what the inflation rate actually is.\n\n\"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount,\" Bivens said. The Federal Reserve’s inflation goal is 2%, which means businesses can hike prices by 2% a year and that shouldn’t cause consumers financial distress. Cost of living increases to workers’ pay are also expected to meet that target to ensure consumers can adequately deal with the rising costs of goods and services.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nIn November, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‒ a measure of the average shift in prices for different products and services ‒ was 3.1%, down slightly from the month before.\n\nAnnual inflation is down dramatically from the 9.1% in June 2022 that marked a 40-year high but remains above the 2% target the Fed sees as the level that signals the rate of price increases is under control.\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it takes into account for its interest rate decisions. The CPI is a primary measure the Fed looks at to help determine if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices don’t count the volatile costs of food and energy items, giving a more accurate window into longer-term trends.\n\nAre wages going up in 2024?\n\nIf you’re deemed a top performer at a company that is offering raises, you’ve got a pretty good chance of getting a pay boost next year.\n\nAbout 3 out of four business leaders told ResumeBuilder.com they intended to give raises. But half of those company executives said only 50% or less of their staff members would see a pay hike, and 82% of the raises would hinge on performance. For those who do manage to get the salary boost, 79% of employers said the pay hikes would be greater than those given in recent years.\n\nAre U.S. Treasury yields rising?\n\nNot recently.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was above 5% in November when the Fed kept rates steady for the second consecutive month the first time it had left the key rate unchanged two months in a row in almost two years.\n\nThat led to mortgage rates spiking to almost 8% and pushed up other borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Stocks meanwhile sank close to a recent low, leading Fed Chair Jerome Powell to say such financial pressures could achieve the same cooling effect on the economy as additional rate hikes.\n\nBut in the following weeks, 10-year Treasury yields dipped to 4.2% and stocks rebounded. That might make the Fed resist rate cuts in case the economy heats up and causes the broader dip in prices “to stall at an uncomfortably elevated level,” Barclays says.\n\nBarclays and Goldman Sachs forecast that rate cuts won’t happen until the spring, and that there will be only two, to a range of 4.75% to 5%, with more cuts implemented in the next two years.\n\nWhen will inflation go back to normal?\n\nIt may take a little while.\n\nInflation’s decline likely “won’t show much progress in coming months,” Barclays wrote in a research note.\n\nOverall price hikes have eased significantly since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, a four-decade high. And in October, broader inflation as well as core prices experienced a dip, leading to a lower 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nBut core prices, which exclude the volatile costs of food and energy, will probably rise 0.3% each of the next three months, Goldman Sachs says. Used cars and furniture have been getting cheaper as the supply-chain shortages of the pandemic end. Meanwhile, health care, auto repairs, car insurance and rent continue to get more expensive, as employers pay higher wages to attract workers amid a labor shortage lingering from the global health crisis.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which leave out the more volatile costs of food and energy, bumped up 0.3% in November, slightly more than the 0.2% uptick seen the previous month. That kept the yearly increase at 4%, the lowest rate since September 2021.\n\nNew inflation tax brackets\n\nInflation may also impact the amount of taxes you have to pay.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said in its annual inflation adjustments report that there will be a 5.4% bump in income thresholds to reach each new level in next year’s tax season.\n\nIn 2024, the lowest rate of 10% will apply to individuals with taxable income up to $11,600 and joint filers up to $23,200. The top rate of 37% will apply to individuals earning over $609,350, and married couples filing jointly who make at least $731,200 a year.\n\nThe IRS makes these adjustments annually, using a formula based on the consumer price index to account for inflation and stave off \"bracket creep,\" which happens when inflation shifts taxpayers into a higher bracket though they’re not seeing any real rise in pay or purchasing power.\n\nThe 2024/25 increase is less than last year's 7% increase, but much more than recent years when inflation was below the current 3.1% inflation rate.\n\nWill Social Security get a raise because of inflation?\n\nYes, but it will be a lot less than what recipients received in 2023.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to Social Security benefits will be 3.2% next year. That’s roughly one-third of the 8.7% increase given in 2023, which marked a forty-year high.\n\nThe 2024 COLA hike is above the average 2.6% raise recipients have received over the past two decades, but seniors remain concerned about being able to pay their expenses as well as the increasing possibility Social Security benefits will be reduced in coming years, according to a retirement survey of 2,258 people by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other to borrow overnight. If that rate increases, banks usually pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow as rates rise on credit cards, adjustable rate mortgages and other loans. That’s why the funds rate is the key mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to calm inflation.\n\nSimply put, companies and consumers don’t borrow as much when loans cost them more, and that means an overheated economy can cool and inflation may dip.\n\nWill credit card interest rates continue to rise this holiday season?\n\nThe Fed’s string of rate hikes, aimed at easing the highest inflation in four decades, are a big reason credit card interest rates have reached record highs just in time for the holiday season.\n\nSome retail credit cards now charge more than 33% interest, topping a 30% threshold that stores and banks were previously able to bypass but seldom did - until now.\n\n“They can charge that much,” said Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center. “Credit cards can actually charge whatever they want. It’s a little-known fact.”\n\nThe domino effect of a high benchmark rate and soaring credit card interest could put many Americans in financial straits this holiday season.\n\nThough some consumers are paring back to deal with high prices, rising debt and shrinking savings, the average shopper expects to spend $1,652 this year on holiday purchases, according to the consultancy Deloitte, more than was typically spent in the last three years.\n\nA lot of the buying will be done with credit cards. In an October poll of 1,036 shoppers by CardRates.com, nearly 4 in 10 respondents said they intend to have holiday credit card debt in the new year.\n\nThe nation’s collective credit card debt was $1.08 trillion, at the end of September, a record high. And the average interest rate was 21%, the highest ever documented by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSavings account impact of high rates\n\nThe upside to the Fed’s string of rate hikes has been that consumers were able to earn good interest on their savings for the first time in years. Even when the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, savers can do well.\n\nUnfortunately, most account holders aren’t making the most of that potential opportunity.\n\nRoughly one-fifth of Americans who have savings accounts don’t know how much interest they’re earning, according to a quarterly Paths to Prosperity study by Santander US, part of the global bank Santander. Among those who did know their account’s interest rate, most were earning less than 3%.\n\nBut consumers have time to make a change that could enable them to make more from their savings.\n\n\"We’re still a long way from (the Fed) beginning to cut rates,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services platform Bankrate. “This is great news for savers, who will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns in the top-yielding, federally insured online savings accounts and certificates of deposit. For borrowers, interest rates staying higher for a longer period underscores the urgency to pay down and pay off costly credit card debt and home equity lines.\"\n\nAmid inflation, Americans seek higher credit card limits\n\nThe string of Fed rate hikes that began in March 2022 has made it costlier for consumers to borrow as interest rates on credit cards and other loans increased dramatically.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has made daily needs more expensive, pushing more Americans to lean on credit cards to get by. But lenders have become more reluctant to issue new cards, so in the midst of the holiday season, more shoppers are seeking higher credit limits, experts say.\n\nIn October, the application rate for higher limits rose to 17.8% from 11.2% in the same month the previous year, and from 12.0% in 2019, New York Fed data showed.\n\nFor some consumers, a higher limit on a card they already have is about their only option.\n\n“After COVID, inflation and interest rates went out of control ... people have less emergency funds for car repairs or buying presents,\" said Brandon Robinson, president and founder of JBR Associates, which specializes in retirement strategies. \"What they’re doing is using more credit card utilization – over 30% or well over 50% of their credit card allowance – and then can’t get approved for another card because their credit rating is down.\"\n\nInflation is leading more Americans to work multiple jobs\n\nThe number of Americans working at least two jobs is at its highest peak since before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to federal data, an uptick that may reflect the financial pressure people are feeling amid high inflation.\n\nAlmost 8.4 million people had multiple jobs in October, the Labor Department said, a figure that represents 5.2% of the laborforce, the highest percentage since January 2020.\n\n“Paying for necessities has become more of a challenge, and affording luxuries and discretionary items has become more difficult, if not impossible for some, particularly those at the lower ends of the income and wealth spectrums,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPeople may also be moonlighting to sock away cash in case they’re laid off since job cuts typically peak at the start of a new year.\n\nWhen will Fed meet?:What is the Federal Reserve's 2024 meeting schedule? Here is when the Fed will meet again.\n\nWhat is the mortgage interest rate today?\n\nMortgage rates are falling, so is it time to buy?\n\nIt depends.\n\nFirst of all, the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions have an impact. For instance, when the central bank was steadily boosting its key rate, the yield on the 10-year treasury bond went up as well. Because those bonds are a gauge for the interest applied to an average 30-year loan, mortgage rates increased.\n\nBut over the past six weeks, mortgage rates have been declining, averaging 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. That’s down from almost 7.8% at the end of October, according to data released by Freddie Mac on Dec. 7.\n\nThat may be giving some wannabe homeowners the confidence to start house hunting. For the week ending Dec. 1, mortgage applications rose 2.8% from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n“However, in the big picture, mortgage rates remain pretty high,” says Danielle Hale, senior economist for Realtor.com. “The typical mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac data is roughly in line with what we saw in August and early to mid-September, which were then 20 plus year highs.”\n\nSo, many potential buyers may still need to sit on the sidelines, waiting for rates to drop further, says Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac. Hale and many other experts believe mortgage rates will dip next year.\n\nInterest rate projection 2024\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates next year, though markets and economists disagree about how many rate cuts there will be.\n\nFutures markets forecast there will be four or five rate cuts in 2024, amounting to a quarter of a percentage point each. The cuts, they predict, should start by spring, and ultimately drop interest rates as low as 4% to 4.25%.\n\nBut core prices, which leave out the volatile costs of food and energy and are the metric followed more closely by the Fed, ticked up 0.3% in November, higher than the 0.2% increase the month before. That might make the Fed more hesitant to nip rates in the immediate future.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Barclays expect there to be only two rate decreases in 2024. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned in recent public remarks that it was “premature” to talk about rate cuts.\n\nNovember inflation report\n\nInflation dipped slightly last month, with falling gas prices mitigating the impact of rising rents.\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 3.1% from a year earlier, slightly below the 3.2% rise in October, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. That slower pace moves the inflation rate nearer to the level, reached in June, that was the lowest in over two years. Month over month, prices increased a slight 0.1%.\n\nCore prices, however, which leave out the more erratic costs of food and energy and which are more closely monitored by the Fed, increased 0.3% in November after rising 0.2% the previous month. That means core inflation’s yearly increase remained at 4%, though it’s the lowest level since September 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/10/12/september-cpi-report-live-updates/71141644007/", "title": "Inflation is way down from last summer. But it's still too high for many.", "text": "Inflation is headed in the right direction but the road remains bumpy.\n\nConsumer price increases stayed high in September after picking up over the summer as steady gains in rent and other services offset another decline in used car prices and a smaller rise in gasoline and food costs.\n\nInflation data this week\n\nPrices overall rose 3.7% from a year earlier, similar to August's increase, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4% following a 0.6% rise in August that was fueled by a surge in pump prices.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items and which the Federal Reserve watches more closely as it weighs interest rate changes, remained high. They rose 0.3% last month after 0.2% bumps over the summer. The advance still lowered the annual increase to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, marking the smallest gain since September 2021.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nHow long will it take for inflation to go down?\n\nAnnual inflation has slowed significantly after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, including a sharp drop to 3% in the first half of 2023. But since then, the cost of some goods and services has accelerated or pulled back more slowly, pushing up the yearly rise.\n\nPrices for items such as used cars and furniture have dropped as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have been resolved. But the cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance, have continued to drift higher in part because of briskly rising employee wages.\n\nAs a result, driving down inflation to the Fed’s annual 2% target is becoming a tougher slog. Barclays expects inflation broadly to dip to 3.3% in December and 2.6% at the end of 2024. Core price gains are projected to drift down to 3.7% at the end of the year and 2.8% at the close of 2024.\n\nWill the Fed raise rates again?\n\nBarclays expects the Fed to raise its key interest rate once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, after lifting it by 5.25 points in 16 months.\n\nBut other economists say tumbling wholesale costs will prompt a faster pullback in inflation.\n\n\"Overall, there is nothing here that will convince Fed officials to hike rates at the next...meeting, and we continue to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and weaker economic growth to result in rates being cut much more aggressively next year than markets are pricing in,\" says economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.\n\nHow did the Dow Jones react?\n\nStocks were mixed in late morning trading as investors digested the uncertain odds of another Fed rate increase. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 70 points, or 0.21% while the S&P 500 index was up 2 points or 0.05%.\n\nHouseholds, meanwhile, are still struggling. Although price increases are moderating, costs are still high and many Americans say they aren’t feeling much relief.\n\nStanley Novack, 78, of Valencia, California, says he’s most frustrated by high gas and grocery costs. “It’s out there, wherever you go,” says Novack, who is semi-retired and works part-time as a hotel and restaurant consultant. “We’re not seeing it easing at all.”\n\nHe says he pays $6.50 a gallon for gas in California and as much as $135 for weekly groceries for him and his wife, up from $100 before the pandemic. “You just have to deal with it,” he says.\n\nWill gas be cheaper in the future?\n\nGasoline prices rose 2.1% in September after surging 10.6% the previous month and they’re up 3% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well below their $5 peak in summer 2022 and are likely to move lower in the short term following the busy summer driving season despite the Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed up oil prices.\n\nAre food prices declining?\n\nGrocery prices rose more modestly, inching up 0.1% and lowering the yearly increase to 2.4%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn generally have fallen as major producers Ukraine and Russia have found alternative shipping routes that skirt their 18-month war.\n\nLast month, the price of breakfast cereal fell 0.5%, while rice and fish both slid 1.3%.\n\nBut some proteins moved higher. Bacon rose 4.8% following a 4% rise in August; uncooked ground beef increased 0.6%; and eggs jumped 0.9% after a string of declines.\n\nWill rent go down in 2024?\n\nRent, which has been the biggest inflation driver, rose a sturdy 0.5% for the second straight month, though that’s down from a spate of stronger gains. That nudged up the yearly rise to 7.4%. Economists expect rent increases to pull back, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nGenerally, the pattern of rising service costs fueled by healthy wage growth and falling goods prices continued last month.\n\nCar repair costs rose 0.2%; auto insurance climbed 1.3%; and hotel rates leaped 3.7%. A key measure of service costs, excluding housing, that the Fed is following closely jumped 0.6%, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic\n\nMeanwhile, used car prices fell 2.5%; clothing dropped 0.8%; and furniture declined 1.2% as supply chain troubles eased further.\n\nDo I really need that?How American consumers are tightening purse strings amid inflation\n\nCurious about inflation? We've got you covered.\n\nUSA TODAY explores the questions you and others ask about inflation and how it affects your life, from \"What is inflation?\" to \"What happens during a recession?\" For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nCOLA 2024\n\nSocial Security recipients will get 3.2% more in their checks next year, a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, based on Thursday's consumer price report showing that annual overall inflation remained at the same level as the previous month.\n\nThe 3.7% rise in overall prices is nearly twice the 2% target favored by the Federal Reserve. But inflation has been mostly trending down, leading to the modest Social Security COLA increase.\n\nWhat’s the difference between CPI and PCE?\n\nMajor differences, according to the Cleveland Fed, are:\n\nBoth indexes calculate the price level by pricing a basket of goods, but their baskets aren’t the same.\n\nCPI is based on a survey of what households are buying; the PCE is based on surveys of what businesses are selling.\n\nCPI only covers out-of-pocket expenditures on goods and services purchased. It excludes other expenditures that are not paid for directly, for example, medical care paid for by employer-provided insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. These are, however, included in the PCE.\n\nPCE accounts for substitutions, which happens when consumers trade down or buy less during times of high inflation. For example, if the price of bread goes up, people buy less bread, and the PCE uses a new basket of goods that accounts for people buying less bread. The CPI uses the same basket as before.\n\nCPI tends to run “hotter,” or higher, than PCE.\n\nHow many times has the Fed raised rates?\n\nThe Fed raised its key rate at 10 meetings in a row starting in March 2022, the most aggressive run of rate hikes in four decades. It paused that streak in June, leaving the benchmark federal funds rate where it stood, but implemented another increase the following month lifting the rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks typically pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive to borrow as rates increase on services and items ranging from credit cards to home equity lines. That’s why the funds rate is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to try and put the brakes on inflation.\n\nWhen it costs more to borrow, businesses and consumers are less inclined to do it, and that means an overheated economy can cool and price increases may slow.\n\nWhen is the next Fed meeting 2023?\n\nThe Fed’s policy arm meets next on Oct. 31-Nov. 1. It will announce its interest rate decision at 2 P.M. ET on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Fed’s final meeting of the year is Dec. 12-13.\n\nU.S. inflation rate by month\n\nThe inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\nJune 2022: 9.1%\n\nJuly 2022: 8.5%\n\nAug 2022: 8.3%\n\nSept 2022: 8.2%\n\nOct 2022: 7.7%\n\nNov 2022: 7.1%\n\nDec 2022: 6.5%\n\nJan 2023: 6.4%\n\nFeb 2023: 6.0%\n\nMar 2023: 5.0&\n\nApr 2023: 4.9%\n\nMay 2023: 4.0%\n\nJune 2023: 3.0%\n\nJuly 2023: 3.2%\n\nAugust 2023: 3.7%\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key measures of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, which are its main considerations in interest-rate decisions. The CPI gives the Fed guidance to assess whether prices are “stable.’’\n\nCPI is also used to inflation-adjust things like Social Security payments and income tax brackets. It’s also the reference rate for some financial contracts, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices leave out volatile food and energy items and therefore are a more accurate reflection of longer-term trends.\n\nWhere should we expect tamer prices?\n\nSeptember used car prices likely fell at least 2% from the prior month, while energy prices recorded a modest increase of 0.4% after a 5.6% jump in August, said Stephen Juneau, U.S. economist at Bank of America. Retail gasoline prices, he said, were nearly flat last month.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists forecast a 2.3% decline in used car prices and a 0.1% dip in new car prices last month.\n\nWhat prices are still rising a lot?\n\nRenters are still getting squeezed. Goldman Sachs economists see rents up 0.48% on the month, rising at about a steady pace. Shelter inflation, which includes home prices, rents and other lodging, comprises about a third of the consumer price index (CPI). However, Goldman says\n\nAirfares are also expected to post a gain, some economists noted.\n\nWill the Fed raise rates again this year?\n\nIt depends on the data.\n\nThe CME Fed watch tool that helps gauge the market’s expectation for a rate move puts the chances of a Fed rate hike at only 10%, but economists aren’t yet fully ruling one out, partly because the labor market remains strong. A strong job market puts money in people’s pockets, which can fuel spending and inflation.\n\n“With the surprisingly-strong September job report intensifying the debate on the further hikes, the near-term policy trajectory will be highly sensitive to Thursday’s CPI,” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note.\n\nThe last time the Fed met in September, it held rates steady at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% but signaled another hike is likely this year amid still elevated inflation and a sturdy economy.\n\n“Broadly, stronger economic activity means we have to do more with rates,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters then.\n\nHe also said, separately, “we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.”\n\nWhat's the difference between CPI and PPI?\n\nCPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers going about their day-to-day lives, while the PPI, or producer price index, measures the average changes over time in the sale prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is gleaned during an earlier phase of the production and marketing cycle and typically impacts CPI.\n\nCore inflation, which assesses inflation but leaves out the more volatile prices of food and energy, is the other key price metric.\n\n10-year Treasury yield\n\nIn bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield, which tends to rise if inflation accelerates, was 4.64%, up a modest 0.046 points.\n\n2024 COLA Watch\n\nSocial Security recipients found out Thursday how much of a raise they will get next year. That’s because the consumer price index report contains data the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses to determine the cost-of-living adjustment or COLA for 2024.\n\nThose payments will go up 3.2%.\n\nWhat is the current inflation rate?\n\nThe annual overall inflation rate is currently 3.7%, but is expected to have slid by a tenth of a point in September.\n\nInflation definition\n\nInflation is a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. The cost of items and services ranging from health care, to gas, to groceries can shift depending on inflation.\n\nDemand pull inflation\n\nWhen there are too few goods to meet the demand, prices are likely to rise, according to Investopedia. That disparity is called demand pull inflation.\n\nInflation calculator\n\nThe Department of Labor has a tool that enables consumers to find out shifts in their buying power.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) looks at the average change in prices for particular products and services over a period of time, according to the Bureau of Labor Services.\n\nIt’s one inflation measure that the Fed and the economist use as a barometer to gauge price stability. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The next PCE report for September is due Oct. 27.\n\nMark your calendar:Why October 12 matters for Social Security recipients\n\nWages vs. inflation:US wage growth is finally outpacing inflation. Many Americans aren't feeling it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/11/01/feds-interest-rates-live-updates/71343892007/", "title": "Fed holds interest rates steady, signals it may hike again", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday but left the door open to another hike, possibly as soon as December, amid a remarkably strong economy and job market.\n\nThe decision leaves the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% following an aggressive campaign of rate increases aimed at taming the nation’s biggest inflation surge in four decades. It marks the first time the Fed has left its federal funds rate unchanged at consecutive meetings in nearly two years.\n\nThe move was widely expected after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech last month that a recent spike in 10-year Treasury bond yields could take the place of additional rate increases, at least for the short term.\n\nBut at a news conference Wednesday, Powell said the rise in bond yields, a fall in stock prices and other strains in financial markets need to endure to prevent additional Fed rate hikes.\n\n\"Tighter conditions would need to persist and that's something that remains to be seen,\" he said.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nWill the Fed raise interest rates again?\n\nYet the Fed signaled Wednesday that it may still raise short-term rates further.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, officials repeated that “in determining the extent of additional (rate increases) that may be appropriate” to lower inflation to the Fed’s 2% goal, they will assess the lags with which its rate hikes affect the economy, inflation and economic and financial developments.\n\nMorgan Stanley had reckoned the Fed would remove the word “additional” to hint that further rate bumps were unlikely.\n\n\"We haven't made a decision about future meetings,\" Powell told reporters. \"We didn't talk about December.\"\n\nHow well is the US economy right now?\n\nSo far, the economy has largely shrugged off the Fed’s sharp rate increases.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said “economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter” and “job gains have moderated since earlier in the year but remain strong.” That marks an upgrade from its previous description.\n\nThe central bank also said, “Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and business are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.” Officials pointedly added the word “financial,” acknowledging the effects of higher long-term bond yields.\n\nWednesday’s decision to stand pat provides another break for consumers who have faced a flurry of rate increases for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans as a result of the Fed’s moves. Yet Americans, especially seniors, are finally benefitting from healthy bank savings yields after years of paltry returns.\n\nWhat happens when the 10-year yield rises?\n\nMeanwhile, the rise in long-term rates, triggered in part by concerns that inflation may stay elevated longer, briefly nudged the 10-year yield above 5% last month for the first time since 2007. The spurt has pushed up 30-year mortgage rates and corporate bond yields – threatening an already struggling housing market and business investment – and hammered the stock market.\n\nTogether, those tighter “financial conditions” are likely to weigh on economic growth and help subdue inflation, effectively doing the work of Fed rate hikes, Powell suggested.\n\nIn September, Fed officials forecast one more rate increase this year but financial markets are betting the central bank is done and will start cutting rates in mid-2024 amid lower inflation and a weaker economy.\n\nFed policymakers are wrestling with a central question: Is the sturdy economy a good thing because it suggests the U.S. could dodge a recession despite the sharp climb in borrowing costs? Or a bad thing because it could keep inflation higher for longer?\n\nIs US inflation slowing down?\n\nThe Fed’s preferred annual inflation measure – which excludes food and energy costs – has fallen substantially since last year but stayed stubbornly high at 3.7% in September on rent and other service costs. Economists expect the measure to decline more rapidly in coming months as both rent hikes and employee wage growth slow.\n\nMeanwhile, the economy grew at a torrid 4.9% annual pace in the third quarter on consumer spending that remains vibrant despite high interest rates and inflation. A big reason: solid job and wage growth.\n\nHow is the job market right now?\n\nA labor market that sizzled in 2021 and 2022 is cooling, with fewer job openings, fewer people switching jobs and more Americans returning to the work force as the pandemic has faded. Those developments have gradually eased longstanding labor shortages and moderated pay increases.\n\nThe Labor Department said Wednesday that job openings were flat at a historically high 9.6 million in September but the share of people quitting jobs, typically to take new positions, was also unchanged at 2.3%. That figure is back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\"Everyone has been very gratified that we have been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without an increase in unemployment,\" Powell said Wednesday.\n\nOverall, the labor market has been sending mixed signals.\n\nAlthough average monthly job growth slowed to less than 200,000 over the summer, U.S. employers added a booming 336,000 jobs in September and unemployment stayed at a historically low 3.8%.\n\nAverage wages also grew more than expected in the third quarter, though the yearly rise for private-sector workers edged down to 4.5% from 4.6% and a peak of 5.7% in mid-2022, according to the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index released Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Powell said that an economy that continues to grow rapidly or a job market that doesn’t cool enough “could put further progress on inflation at risk” and warrant additional rate increases. That suggests the Fed could lift rates again even if inflation is softening.\n\nBut he also said officials are “proceeding carefully” as they debate more rate increases and have become more concerned about the risk of nudging the economy into a recession.\n\n\"We've come far enough that the risks are more two-sided,\" Powell said. \"The risk of doing too much vs. doing too little is getting more balanced.\"\n\nHe also said the economy will likely need to soften further for inflation to reach the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nBarclays believes the Fed “will need to force a mild downturn in activity to break the strong momentum in the economy in order to bring inflation back down, implying one or two more hikes.”\n\nOther economists are more sanguine that a growing economy and falling inflation can coexist. They expect growth to slow markedly early next year as student loan repayments paused during the pandemic resume, and rising credit card delinquencies and high long-term bond rates constrain consumer and business spending.\n\nGoldman Sachs says the Fed seems to be achieving an ideal “soft landing,” in which rate hikes wrestle down inflation and tamp down growth without causing a recession.\n\nOxford Economics expects a listless economy will keep the the from hiking again but also defer rate cuts to later in 2024.\n\n\"We think the economy is more likely to be characterized by a period of extended sluggish growth rather than a couple of quarters of contraction followed by a relatively quick rebound,\" says Oxford economist Nancy Vanden Houten. \"We think this growth profile will leave the Fed on hold for even longer than we previously thought and will push the first rate cut ... to September.\"\n\nHow is the stock market doing today?\n\nAfter a rough few weeks amid surging Treasury yields and geopolitical concerns, the stock market got a boost Wednesday following the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe S&P 500 index closed the day up 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6%.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nUSA TODAY explains today's interest-rate news. For more information about the Fed decision and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nMonetary policy definition\n\nMonetary policy is the action central banks take to achieve price stability, full employment, stable economic growth and other objectives, according to the Fed’s website. It differs from fiscal policy, which refers to the federal government’s tax and spending policies.\n\nFed rate hike history\n\nSince March 2022, the Fed has increased its benchmark federal funds rate 11 times, to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. It boosted the key rate at 10 meetings in a row, the steepest streak of rate hikes in four decades.\n\nWhat’s the unemployment rate?\n\nThe unemployment rate held steady at 3.8% in September. There were 336,000 jobs added despite high interest rates and inflation, the strongest monthly gain since January.\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nA recession is \"a significant decline in economic activity that spreads across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\" according to Michael Pugliese, an economist with Wells Fargo.\n\nThe nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, which designates when a recession occurred, takes many indicators into account, including the unemployment rate, consumer spending, retail sales and industrial production.\n\nThe last two recessions occurred when the economy was jolted by a housing crisis in 2008/2009 and then the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which led to massive layoffs as many businesses faltered or were forced to close when people hunkered down in their homes.\n\nMany feared that the U.S. would tip into a recession because of the aggressive rate hikes initiated by the Federal Reserve to cool an economy that rapidly ramped up as the pandemic eased. But the economy has remained surprisingly strong and fears of a recession are waning.\n\nHow does raising interest rates help inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks typically pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow as rates increase on credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. That’s why the funds rate is the key mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation.\n\nBusinesses and consumers don’t borrow as much when loans cost more, and that means an overheated economy can cool off and the rate of price increases may slow.\n\nWhat causes inflation?\n\nInflation can have many causes. Most often, it’s sparked by \"a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services,\" said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nThat means more people are scooping up items and services than there is adequate supply, spurring producers to boost prices.\n\n\"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things,\" Bivens said. \"But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up.\"\n\nInflation can also occur when there are too few producers, or there aren’t enough workers to provide the desired products and services, Bivens said. Finally, economies also have some \"built-in inflation\" to help ensure inflation is reined in. In the U.S., that goal is 2%, meaning businesses can raise prices by 2% a year and that shouldn’t weigh down consumers. That’s also the usual cost of living raise offered to workers.\n\nWhen will inflation go down?\n\nInflation has dramatically dipped since it reached a forty-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. But the rate of price increases has never slipped to the Fed’s 2% target. That’s due primarily to leisure activities, car repairs and other tasks becoming pricier as wages have risen.\n\nDoes raising interest rates hurt the economy?\n\nOver time it will, according to at least two economics and finance professors who presented a paper on the topic at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this past summer.\n\nThe Fed raises interest rates to curb borrowing since loans become more expensive, and that slowdown can cool the economy and ultimately bring down inflation. But those hikes can also hinder overall economic output and hinder growth in the long run, the paper noted. “Our findings suggest that monetary policy may affect the productive capacity of the economy in the longer term,” wrote Yueran Ma and Kaspar Zimmermann, economics and finance professors at the University of Chicago. “A slower pace of innovation may then have lasting effects.”\n\nU.S. inflation rate by month\n\nThe inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:\n\n◾ May 2022: 8.6%\n\n◾ June 2022: 9.1%\n\n◾ July 2022: 8.5%\n\n◾ Aug 2022: 8.3%\n\n◾ Sept 2022: 8.2%\n\n◾ Oct 2022: 7.7%\n\n◾ Nov 2022: 7.1%\n\n◾ Dec 2022: 6.5%\n\n◾ Jan 2023: 6.4%\n\n◾ Feb 2023: 6.0%\n\n◾ Mar 2023: 5.0&\n\n◾ Apr 2023: 4.9%\n\n◾ May 2023: 4.0%\n\n◾ June 2023: 3.0%\n\n◾ July 2023: 3.2%\n\n◾ August 2023: 3.7%\n\n◾ September 2023: 3.7%\n\nFed dot plot\n\nThe Fed’s dot plot can be found in the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections report. It’s a visual layout of where individual Fed officials predict interest rates will be years into the future. The dot plot was first created in late 2011 and was meant to add more transparency to the Fed's moves when it came to monetary policy.\n\nThe most recent forecast for the fund rate is 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year, and 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2024.\n\nCOLA 2024\n\nThose who receive Social Security will see their cost of living adjustment (COLA) rise 3.2% next year, a steep drop from the 8.7% COLA in 2023 which was a four-decade high.\n\nThat’s still above the 2.6% average over the past 20 years, but many seniors remain worried about how they’ll get by, particularly if the all-important retirement benefit sustains cuts in coming years, according to the latest retirement poll conducted by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group.\n\nWhat is consumer price index?\n\nIn September, the consumer price index – a measure of the average change in prices for different products and services - was 3.7%, mostly unbudged from the month before.\n\nAnnual inflation is far below a four-decade high of 9.1%, hit in June 2022. But it sank to 3% in the first six months of this year, some products and services have gotten more expensive or been slower to go down in cost, leading to a yearly increase.\n\nPrices at the pump ticked up 2.1% in September after spiking 10.6% the month before, and are 3% higher compared with the previous year. Still, gas is far cheaper than the $5 peak in summer 2022 and will probably become even cheaper in the near future now that the summer driving season has passed and despite the Israel-Hamas war, which has led to higher oil prices. Food prices rose slightly, up 0.1% but slowed the annual increase to 2.4%. And though rent remains the key source of inflation, the 0.5% uptick in September was still less than several previous months.\n\nWhy is price index important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve keeps tabs on two key aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it takes into account for its interest-rate decisions. The index is a primary measure the Fed considers to help determine if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is the difference between consumer price index and core consumer price index?\n\nCore prices don’t count the volatile costs of food and energy items, giving a more accurate picture of longer-term trends.\n\nWhat is the Fed?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the center of the nation’s banking system, working behind the scenes to ensure the economy is stable and operating sufficiently, and that there is also a balance between the nation’s financial health and consumer interests. Its goal is “maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates,’’ according to its website.\n\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law on December 23, 1913, following a severe financial crisis dubbed the Panic of 1907. The Fed was created by Congress \"to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system,\" according to the Fed's website.\n\nHow many districts make up the Federal Reserve System?\n\nThere are 12 Districts that make up the Federal Reserve System, each with its own Reserve Bank. Reserve Banks are located in:\n\n◾ Boston\n\n◾ New York\n\n◾ Philadelphia\n\n◾ Cleveland\n\n◾ Richmond, Virginia\n\n◾ Atlanta\n\n◾ Chicago\n\n◾ St. Louis\n\n◾ Minneapolis\n\n◾ Kansas City\n\n◾ Dallas\n\n◾ San Francisco\n\nThe districts operate independently but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, according to the board's website.\n\nIs the Fed done raising interest rates?\n\nThe Fed has signaled it could hike interest rates at least once more before the end of the year as inflation continues to hover above its 2% target.\n\n“Given ongoing economic resilience, we expect one more hike from the Fed, though it remains a close call,’’ according to an investors note from B of A Global Research.\n\nBut an underlying gauge of inflation slowed last quarter, and high Treasury yields could dampen borrowing by businesses and would-be home buyers, lowering prices and making another hike by the Fed unnecessary.\n\nWhether or not the Fed decides to give the key rate another bump this year, it still may be unlikely the central bank will cut the rate anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told an Economic Club of New York Luncheon last month that \"while the path is likely to be bumpy and take some time, my colleagues and I are united in our commitment to bringing inflation down sustainably to 2%,\" from the current rate of 3.7%\n\nA wildcard that could lead to rate cuts is a recession. “Consumer spending remains the most important growth engine in the economy,’’ ING Economics said in an investors note, “and with real household disposable income flat-lining, savings being exhausted and consumer credit being repaid … we see the primary risk being recession. If right, this will depress inflation pressures even more rapidly than the Fed is anticipating, giving it the scope to cut policy rates in the first half of next year.”\n\nI Bonds interest rates are soaring\n\nInflation-indexed savings bonds, or I Bonds, bought from November through April 2024 have an interest rate of 5.27%, according to the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Fiscal Service. That’s great news, but even better: the key fixed rate that is in place for the life of the bond is up to 1.3% - a major bump from the 0.9% rate for I Bonds distributed from May through October. New rates for savings bonds are set each May 1 and Nov. 1.\n\nThe rate for Series I Savings Bonds is a mix of the fixed rate, which lasts for the 30-year life of the bond, and an inflation-driven rate, which usually shifts every six months based on how much inflation is dipping or rising.\n\nWill this affect auto loan interest rates?\n\nIt’s unlikely auto loan rates will fall much, if at all.\n\nIn the three months ended September, APRs for both used and new vehicle loans rose to the highest levels since 2007, according to car research platform Edmunds. They were 7.4% and 11.2%, respectively, it said.\n\n\"Spiked interest rates remain the biggest impediment to affordability in both the new and used car markets today,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. “And while the Federal Reserve held off on raising the federal funds rate in their most recent session, the expectation is rates will remain high or even increase slightly through the end of the year, which may help tame inflation in the long run but is inflating monthly payments for now.”\n\nIn the three months through September, the share of consumers who financed a new vehicle with a monthly payment of $1,000 or more rose to an all-time high of 17.5%, Edmunds said.\n\nSales of EVs, with their already hefty price tags, may be suffering the most. EV inventories are piling up and automakers are cutting production in response despite many government tax breaks.\n\nIs the Federal Reserve part of the government?\n\nIt is. The Federal Reserve System is the U.S.’s central bank.\n\nHow is the U.S. economy doing?\n\nThe U.S. economy surged in the third quarter thanks to consumers spending more despite high interest rates and inflation. That uptick made up for a decline in business investment.\n\nThe value of all services and goods made in the U.S., or GDP, grew at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% for the year in the period spanning July to September, according to the Commerce Department. That was more than double the 2.1% uptick in the previous quarter and the fastest clip of growth since the end of 2021 when the economy made a dramatic rebound from the recession sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWill my credit card debt get less expensive if the Fed stops raising rates?\n\nNo.\n\n“No one should think that credit card APRs are going to stop climbing anytime soon,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at online lending platform LendingTree. “They won’t rise as rapidly as they have in the past 18 months, but they’re most likely going to keep rising, at least a little bit and at least for a while longer.”\n\nThe average APR on a new credit card offer is 24.46%, the highest since LendingTree started tracking this in 2019, and the average APR on a card that carries a balance is a record 22.27%, according to Fed data.\n\nStore credit cards are worse, with rates commonly at 30% and some as high as 35%, Schulz said. Consumers should resist the temptation to get one while shopping this holiday, he said.\n\nThose with credit card debt should pay down as much debt as possible, roll over balances to a 0% interest card if possible, or call your issuer and ask for a lower rate.\n\nHow likely is a recession in 2024?\n\nEconomists polled in September said there was a 48% chance the U.S. will experience a downturn over the next year, a slip from the 61% odds projected in May.\n\nBarclays predicted a loss of roughly 375,000 jobs by the middle of next year. However, consumer spending remains robust despite high inflation and interest rates that are making credit card use and consumer loans more expensive. And that may help stave off a recession, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nCredit card interest hits record high\n\nA goal of the rate hikes is to make borrowing more expensive for shoppers and businesses. And in one corner of the economy, there are clear signs that's happening. The average retail credit card now charges 28.93% interest, a record high, according to Bankrate.\n\nCan they even do that? The short answer: yes.\n\nRates on cards have reached historic highs, largely in response to the Fed's actions in 2022 and 2023. Credit card analysts see those rates as a red flag as the nation heads into the season of giving. Inflation-weary shoppers may be tempted to put big purchases on a new store card, unaware of the interest they will face if they carry the balance into the new year.\n\nSavings accounts are earning more because of Fed rate hikes\n\nOne silver lining in the wake of the Fed’s rate hikes is that for the first time in years, consumers can earn good interest on their savings. And even if the Fed holds interest rates steady, savers remain the big winners.\n\nThe downside? Most account holders aren’t taking advantage.\n\nAbout one-fifth of Americans who have savings accounts don’t know how much interest they’re getting, according to a quarterly Paths to Prosperity study by Santander US, part of the global bank Santander. And of those who are aware of their interest rate, most are earning less than 3%.\n\nBut it’s not too late for consumers to make a move that allows them to earn more from their money.\n\n\"We’re still a long way from (the Fed) beginning to cut rates,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services platform Bankrate. “This is great news for savers, who will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns in the top-yielding, federally insured online savings accounts and certificates of deposit. For borrowers, interest rates staying higher for a longer period underscores the urgency to pay down and pay off costly credit card debt and home equity lines.\"\n\nJust beware. Not all savings earn the same amount:\n\n◾ Traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts only return about 0.47%\n\n◾ Money market mutual funds (MMFs) from brokerage firms have generally kept up with the federal funds rate. One of the largest MMFs, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX), has a 7-day SEC yield of 5.29% (a 7-day SEC yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year).\n\n◾ CD rates have remained relatively stable, with the 5-year CD yield around 3.95%, below January 1’s 4.04%.\n\n◾ Online rates mirror Treasury yields, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. For example, average online 1-year CD yields are 5.18%, 123 bps above the average online 5-year CD yield of 3.95%.\n\nWhat are mortgage interest rates right now?\n\nThe Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions have pumped up the yield on the 10-year treasury bond. The 10-year bond yield is used as a guide for setting interest on average 30-year loans, and that is helping fuel higher mortgage rates, according to experts.\n\nLast week, 30-year fixed mortgage rates climbed to 7.79%, topping the 1971 historical high of 7.74%, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) trade association.\n\nTo see how that’s added to the cost of a home, take a $400,000 home. A mortgage interest rate of 7.79% means a mortgage payment of $2,301. One year ago, the same $400,000 home had a rate of 7.08% and would have a monthly payment of $2,146—a savings of $155 that could go towards paying utilities or gas for a month, said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist.\n\n“This mortgage interest rate is pricing out some first-time home buyers by reducing housing affordability, especially with the rise in home prices,” she said.\n\nPricier homes have made it cheaper for first-time buyers in some markets to rent instead.\n\nWhy aren't we saving more?:Savings accounts now pay serious interest, but most of us aren't claiming it, survey finds\n\nCOLA 2024:Will 3.2% Social Security 2024 COLA be enough to help seniors recover from inflation?\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nInflation is the term for a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, head of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nEverything from food to rent can become more expensive due to inflation. However, it is the cumulative impact that determines what the inflation rate is.\n\n\"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount,\" Bivens said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s inflation goal is 2%, which means businesses can boost prices by 2% a year and that shouldn’t cause consumers financial duress. Cost of living increases paid by employers are also expected to meet that target to make sure consumers can keep up with the increasing costs of goods and services.\n\nWhat is the S&P 500 doing?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.03% and the S&P 500 climbed 0.28% as of 12:48 p.m. EDT – ahead of the Fed’s rate decision later Wednesday.\n\nWhat is the inflation rate?\n\nOverall prices were up 3.7% in September as compared to a year earlier, according to the consumer price index. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.4% following a 0.6% uptick in August, as steeper rent and more expensive services balanced out dips in used car prices and a slowdown in gas and grocery costs.\n\nCore prices, which don’t count food and energy items whose costs tend to be volatile, were up 0.3% that month, but the yearly uptick slowed to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, the slimmest increase since September 2021.\n\nWhat is the Fed funds rate?\n\nThe key rate is 5.25% to 5.5%\n\nFed meeting dates\n\nThe Fed’s remaining meeting schedule for 2023 is:\n\n◾ December 12-13\n\nWhen does the Fed speak today?\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to speak at 2:30 p.m. EST Wednesday.\n\nIs the Fed raising rates again?\n\nThe key rate is expected to remain at 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\n“The Fed will not raise rates this week, as there is no need to exercise that option just yet and the markets are not demanding further tightening,’’ Erik Weisman, Chief Economist & Portfolio Manager at MFS Investment Management said in an investors note. “But, until the labor market has cooled considerably, and inflationary pressures display sufficiently persistent containment, the Fed will keep the option of future rate hikes firmly on the table.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/food/2023/01/25/why-are-eggs-now-so-expensive-how-it-is-affecting-oklahoma-businesses/69815821007/", "title": "Why are eggs now so expensive? How it is affecting Oklahoma ...", "text": "Avian Influenza \"decimated\" commercial poultry flocks in 2022, which led to major egg supply chain issues.\n\nOklahoma farmers are less affected by bird flu but are still facing related cost challenges.\n\nRestaurants, particularly breakfast spots, feel the same sticker shock.\n\nWhat’s next? The market keeps fluctuating, so some are considering purchasing chicks from Oklahoma hatcheries.\n\nIf you've taken a stroll through the aisles of your local grocery store lately, you've probably noticed that most items are rising in cost. However, one household staple seems to have outpaced all the others with inflation price adjustment: eggs.\n\nIn December 2021, one dozen eggs retailed for about $1.79, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of December 2022, the price had risen to an average of $4.25 per dozen, or 311% higher.\n\nUsually when someone mentions trickle-down economics, they aren't talking about eggs, but the rising cost of this kitchen item is having an effect on grocers, restaurants, households and bird producers throughout the state.\n\nWhy are eggs so expensive?\n\nThe single largest cause of disruption to the egg supply chain has been an outbreak of a particularly contagious and extremely deadly bird flu, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).\n\nAccording to reporting from The Associated Press, egg prices are up significantly more than other foods — even more than chicken or turkey — because egg farmers were hit harder by the bird flu. More than 43 million of the 58 million birds slaughtered over the past year to control the virus have been egg-laying chickens, including some farms with more than a million birds apiece in major egg-producing states like Iowa.\n\nMore:Deadly bird flu strikes backyard chickens in Tulsa, waterfowl near OKC\n\nRodney Holcomb, OSU Extension specialist in food economics, said states that saw commercial poultry flocks decimated by avian influenza in 2022 are still recovering. The demand for laying hens continues to outpace egg supplies, and it takes time to rebuild those operations.\n\n“The price of chicken also went up last year because of avian influenza, but the rebound is faster for broilers,” he said. “It only takes about six weeks to go from a hatched chick to a broiler that’s ready for market. With laying hens, it takes months for them to grow to sexual maturity, start laying eggs and provide a consistent supply at peak production.”\n\nHow are OKC farmers and retailers affected by problems with the egg supply?\n\nOne source of eggs seeing less of an impact from HPAI is local farmers. Chelsey Simpson, co-owner of Urban Agrarian, said none of the stores producers have been affected by the virus.\n\n\"That supply chain is a lot shorter, and that makes it a lot more resilient because there are fewer places where things can go wrong,\" she said. \"A lot of times, we find ourselves — in a crisis — having more items in stock than more traditional, industrial stores.\"\n\nRising fuel, labor, packaging and feed costs do impact local producers of eggs and other products, and these increases further compound the issue of bird flu facing industrial farms, driving up costs even further. Still, eggs at local outlets like Urban Agrarian and Paseo Farmers Market have not experienced the major price jumps many are seeing in traditional grocery store products. However, Simpson points out local eggs started at a higher price to begin with.\n\n\"For a long time, our eggs have been priced in the $6 to $8 range, roughly, which is a lot more than what industrial eggs are going for,\" she said. \"The American public has been really accustomed to extremely low egg prices for a really long time, and I like to say there's no such thing as cheap food; it's only a matter of who's paying the price.\"\n\nSimpson said the cost of paying $2 a dozen for eggs produced through large-scale factory farm operations often means the cost may be passed on in the form of pollution, underpaid farmers and farm workers, poorly treated animals, taxpayer-funded subsidies to the corporations running the farms and a number of other issues.\n\nAt Urban Agrarian, while the bird flu has not created issues in the supply, a temporary disruption was caused by an increased demand last week and the store has since restocked.\n\n\"We didn't anticipate this crazy run on eggs,\" she said. \"We've seen prices increasing for months. We didn't know that the world was about to panic about eggs, or we would've bought a lot more.\"\n\nWhat do egg supply issues mean for OKC restaurants?\n\nFarmers, retailers and shoppers aren't the only ones facing the fallout from avian flu and inflation. The skyrocketing cost of eggs are affecting restaurants across the board. Perhaps some of the restaurants most prone to feeling the pressure from rising prices are those specializing in menus on foods that are egg-centered like popular midtown breakfast and brunch haunt, Waffle Champion.\n\n\"It’s a challenging situation on our end, for sure. There’s not much we can do but wait it out, since at the end of the day, I haveto keep buying eggs, whatever they may cost,\" said Waffle Champion Kitchen Manager Vicente Martinez. \"We’ve had to update our menu pricing over the last few years, same as any other place, but there’s only so much a consumer is willing to pay for someone else to scramble their eggs for them.\"\n\nMartinez said it isn't the first time the restaurant has seen inflation affect prices though, and the only thing to do at times is to adapt and ride out the normal up and down cycles.\n\n\"Fortunately, these things come in waves. The price of honey shot up for a while at the start of the Ukrainian crisis, and that affected us, which was something I wasn’t prepared for at all!” he said.\n\nIs raising my own eggs a realistic option?\n\nWith the passage of an ordinance that took effect in March 2022, Oklahoma City's council approved the raising of up to six chickens and quail in Oklahoma City backyards. Some residents may be considering whether this is a viable alternative to purchasing eggs at the grocery store.\n\nOklahoma hatcheries and poultry sellers are seeing an increased demand for their products. Mountain Valley Ameraucanas, a seller in southwest Oklahoma near Roosevelt said on Facebook it had already booked more than 50% of its spring chicks.\n\nNew backyard residents: OKC city council approves chickens, quail on lots under an acre\n\nRachel Johnson-Heldermon, of The Gypsy Hen Poultry in Afton, said she is not only seeing more demand, but and earlier demand for chicks and hatching eggs than in years past.\n\n\"Definitely a lot of folks reaching out wanting to get chicks and hatching eggs for the first time,\" she said. \"This time of year, it takes every single bird I have to get the eggs and chicks I'll need.\"\n\nJohnson-Heldermon said people who choose to venture into raising their own chickens need to remember the importance of overall flock health and safety when it comes to predators, one specific example many overlook being domesticated dogs.\n\nOklahoma City's ordinance does not require permits or licensing for backyard chickens, but owners must provide clean coops that provide protection and must meet other requirements, including limitations for space and distances from property lines.\n\nWhen will the price of eggs begin to fall?\n\nHolcomb does not expect prices to fall dramatically on eggs as inflation across the board will influence the 2023 price outlook. Prices could begin to see a steady decline but will likely remain higher than expected through the second quarter of 2023.\n\nHowever, the industry’s new normal is yet to be determined as the higher fuel, feed and fertilizer costs paired with the potential for future HPAI outbreaks could potentially increase prices.\n\n“It’s still a relatively inexpensive protein source, but you’d have to get back down to the $2.50 to $3 range per dozen just to be somewhere in the same category as an inflation-adjusted normal price relative to every other food product,” Holcomb said.\n\nThe USDA has shown some recent decline in egg prices, but overall pricing held steady throughout most of December and January, and the trend is likely to continue.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/11/14/cpi-report-october-2023-inflation-live-updates/71573325007/", "title": "CPI 2023 October: Inflation eased on lower gas prices.", "text": "After rising and then moving sideways in recent months, inflation emphatically resumed its descent in October.\n\nConsumer price increases eased more than expected as falling gasoline and used car prices offset another rise in rent and a rebound in health insurance costs.\n\nAn underlying measure of price increases that the Federal Reserve watches more closely stayed elevated but also pulled back, bolstering the case for the Fed to continue to hold rates steady after a flurry of aggressive hikes.\n\nConsumer prices overall rose 3.2% from a year earlier, down from 3.7% in September, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. That pulled inflation closer to the more than two-year low it reached in June and July, before a surge in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged following a 0.4% rise the previous month.\n\nThe developments at least raise the prospect of some longer-lasting relief for Americans who have struggled to keep pace with rapidly rising prices triggered by pandemic-related supply chain troubles and consumer demand surges for more than two years.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n\"October’s report had good news for both winning the long-term inflation fight and easing some short-term pain,\" says corporate economist Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items and which the Fed follows more closely, rose 0.2% after 0.3% bumps the previous two months. The advance pushed the annual increase to 4% from 4.1% in September, the lowest since September 2021.\n\nHow is the S&P 500 stock index reacting to inflation?\n\nInvestors welcomed the encouraging report. The Dow Jones industrial averaged soared 465 points, or 1.4%, in midday trading to 34,798. And the S&P 500 index rose 1.7% to 4,488.\n\nHow is the 10-year Treasury yield responding to the news?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 4.46% from 4.64% late Monday. That’s a significant move for the bond market. Just a few weeks ago, the 10-year yield was above 5% and at its highest level since 2007. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nHow long will it take for inflation to go back to normal?\n\nSince reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has come down substantially but remained stubbornly high in recent months.Prices for goods such as used cars and furniture have dropped as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have unwound. But the cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance, have continued to edge higher in part because of swiftly rising employee wages tied to labor shortages. Last month, however, inflation slowed more dramatically.\n\nDriving down inflation to the Fed’s 2% goal is still becoming more challenging than it was several months ago amid a healthy economy and job market, says economist Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics.\n\nWill the Fed raise interest rates again?\n\nBarclays expects the Fed to raise its key interest rate once more in early 2024, by a quarter percentage point, after hoisting it by 5.25 points in 16 months.\n\nBut other economists say inflation's drop last month, along with falling wholesale costs and a cooling job market will trigger a faster pullback in inflation, prompting the Fed to stand pat.\n\n\"We continue to expect a further decline in inflation over the coming months, which will bring interest rate cuts onto the agenda before long,\" says economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.\n\nWhy are gas prices falling?\n\nGasoline prices dropped 5% in October after rising 2.1% the previous month and they’re down 5.3% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well below their $5 peak in summer 2022 but surged in August on higher oil prices amid a brighter global outlook and OPEC production cuts.\n\nRecently, gas prices have fallen as the busy summer driving season ended and refiners began using cheaper winter gasoline blends. Regular unleaded prices averaged $3.36 nationally Monday, down from $3.63 a month ago, according to AAA.\n\nIn the months ahead, however, lean oil supplies and healthy demand could drive pump costs higher, Barclays says.\n\nWill grocery prices go down?\n\nGrocery prices rose 0.3% after two months of more modest increases but that still lowered the yearly advance to 2.1%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn generally have come down this year as major producers Ukraine and Russia have found alternative shipping routes that skirt their 18-month war. But severe weather has disrupted supplies recently.\n\nLast month, the price of several proteins jumped. Uncooked ground beef was up 1.5%; bacon, 1.8%; and chicken, 0.3%. Breakfast cereal was up 0.6% and bread leaped 1%.\n\nSome staples provided consumers some relief. Rice prices declined 0.9%, fresh fish and seafood dipped 0.1%, and cookies fell 1.1%.\n\nWhy are rents going up so much?\n\nRent continued to serve as the most stubborn hurdle to reining in inflation, rising a sturdy 0.5% for the third straight month, though that’s down from a spate of stronger gains. That nudged down the yearly rise to 7.2%. Economists expect rent increases to pull back, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nThe price of other services kept rising, with car insurance up 1.9%, auto repairs, up 0.2% and medical care services up 0.3% for a second straight month. But hotel rates fell 2.5%, partly offsetting a 3.7% rise the prior month, and air fares declined nearly 1% on lower jet fuel costs.\n\nGoods prices continued to generally head lower. Used car prices dipped 0.8% after a 2.5% decline in September. Appliance costs dropped 1.2% and apparel ticked up just 0.1%.\n\nAre health insurance premiums rising or falling?\n\nHealth insurance costs rose 1.1%, reversing steady declines that have left prices 34% lower than they were a year ago. Insurance rates are difficult to measure because of widely varying plans and so Labor bases its calculation on insurance company profits. Those tumbled in 2021 as Americans resumed medical procedures they had deferred during the pandemic, narrowing insurance firms’ net income.\n\nStarting last month, though, officials began relying on the companies’ 2022 profits, which swelled as medical procedures returned closer to normal. As a result, insurance costs are expected to contribute to inflation as measured by the CPI over the next year.\n\nMore on inflation\n\nFor more questions and answers about inflation, keep reading.\n\nCurrent inflation rate\n\nConsumer prices increased 3.2% in October as compared to the previous year, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index released Tuesday morning. The lower than expected rate showed inflation is edging towards the more than two-year low seen this summer before gas prices spiked. From month to month, overall prices rose 0.4% in October, the same uptick as September.\n\nWhat time did CPI come out?\n\nThe October CPI report was released at 8:30 AM ET, Tuesday, November 14.\n\nWhat is a depression vs. recession?\n\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a set answer.\n\nA recession is typically described by economists as a major decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. Usually, the downturn shows up in real GDP, real income, industrial production, the labor market and wholesale-retail sales, and is deemed a recession when there are two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s no set definition for an economic depression, although it’s usually the term applied to a severe recession.\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nInflation is a \"generalized rise in prices,\" says Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank headquartered in Washington D.C. The cost of items and services ranging from groceries, to health care, to gas can rise and dip depending on inflation.\n\nNew inflation tax brackets\n\nInflation may impact what tax bracket you fall into.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said in its yearly inflation adjustments report that there will be a 5.4% increase in income thresholds to reach each new tier in the 2024/25 tax season.\n\nNext year, the lowest rate of 10% will apply to individuals with taxable income up to $11,600 and joint filers up to $23,200. The highest rate of 37% will apply to individuals making more than $609,350, and married couples filing jointly who earn $731,200 or more.\n\nThe IRS makes these tweaks every year, relying on a formula pegged to the consumer price index in order to deal with inflation and to stave off \"bracket creep,\" which occurs when inflation moves taxpayers into a higher bracket though they’re not experiencing any real uptick in earnings or buying power.\n\nNext year’s increase is below last year's 7% bump, but far more than recent years when inflation was lower than the 3.7% annual inflation rate U.S. consumers experienced in September.\n\nCruise lines, too, are raising gratuity rates\n\nSeveral major cruise lines have raised their gratuity prices in recent months, partly because of inflation. Royal Caribbean International began charging passengers $18 per guest, per day for non-suite staterooms Saturday, up from $16. Passengers in suites will pay $20.50, up from $18.50. The hikes follow similar moves from other cruise lines this year.\n\nInflation is prompting more Americans to take multiple jobs\n\nThe number of Americans working two or more jobs has reached its highest level since the pandemic’s start, a trend that suggests more of us are feeling inflation’s pinch.\n\nNearly 8.4 million people held multiple jobs in October, the Labor Department reported this month. They represent 5.2% of the workforce, the largest share of moonlighters since January 2020. Experts say people may be taking on extra work in response to inflation, which has outpaced wage growth through much of the past two years.\n\nInflation will blunt Social Security COLA boost in 2024\n\nInflation will more or less cancel out the annual cost-of-living adjustment (or COLA) in Social Security checks, seniors say, leaving many families struggling to keep up. Starting in January, more than 66 million beneficiaries will receive 3.2% more in their monthly checks, a bump that averages about $50.\n\nCOLA is meant to help Americans keep pace with inflation and maintain their standard of living. But many seniors say the Social Security hikes are falling short. For older adults, the biggest expense is health care.\n\nBusinesses are pressing for more tips to counter inflation\n\nTipping requests have exploded in the past couple of years, and inflation is one reason. After more than two years of rising consumer prices, businesses are feeling squeezed and looking to pass on expenses by requesting more tips for staff, experts say.\n\n“Tipflation” takes many forms. Businesses prompt customers to leave large tips on checkout screens, or press for a tip on a takeout order. They may also calculate a tip on the after-tax amount, instead of the pretax total, or suggest a tip after adding an automatic gratuity to the bill.\n\nTired of tipping:Are we at a 'tipping' point? You're not imagining it. How and why businesses get you to tip more\n\nTax Brackets:New IRS tax brackets and standard deductions for 2024: See how much they were raised", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/egg-prices/index.html", "title": "Why egg prices are still going up | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSeveral grocery items have gotten more expensive this year. But nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices.\n\nIn the year through November, not adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices jumped 49%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince early this year, a deadly avian flu has been reducing poultry flocks — specifically turkeys and egg-laying hens. That’s one reason for the unrelenting increase in prices. But the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket.\n\nExperts think that the peak has passed, but until these conditions improve, expect to pay more for eggs in the grocery store.\n\nWholesale prices hit a record\n\nAvian flu has been a problem in the US for several months now, but in recent weeks wholesale prices have been hitting records.\n\nAs of last week, “prices have been escalating for nine consecutive weeks… setting new record highs on a daily basis since the week of Thanksgiving,” said Karyn Rispoli, editor of the Egg Price Current for Urner Barry, which offers food market data.\n\nOn Friday, Midwest large eggs, the benchmark for eggs sold in their shells, hit $5.46 per dozen, Rispoli said, citing Urner Barry’s data. This time last year, Urner Berry’s data shows, that price was around $1.70.\n\nEggs have gotten much more expensive this year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nOne reason for the increase? Not enough supply.\n\n“There’s simply not been enough production to support the incredibly strong retail demand we’ve seen this year,” Rispoli said. Supply has been constrained by the deadly bird flu.\n\nThe current outbreak of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza started in the US around February, and has persisted throughout the year. The last major bird flu outbreak in the United States was in 2015. But that one was contained by June of that year, noted Brian Earnest, lead economist for animal protein in CoBank.\n\n“This year, we’ve continued to see flock depopulations throughout the entire year, and there’s an expectation that we’ll continue to see it into 2023,” he said, noting that he expects “we’re going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward.”\n\nAbout 60 million birds are gone because of the disease so far, according to the USDA. Of those, about 43 million are egg-laying hens, according to USDA data provided by the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group which markets eggs.\n\nStill, farmers have been able to moderate the losses. “Our producers learned a lot of hard lessons from 2015,” said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board. Some farmers have been able to repopulate their flocks, decreasing the net impact on flock sizes and egg supplies. As of early December, there were about 308 million hens laying eggs for consumption, down from about 328 million in December 2021, according to the USDA.\n\nThe supply squeeze isn’t the only thing contributing to higher egg prices, said Metz. Higher fuel, feed and other producer cost are also driving up wholesale prices, she said. And then there’s that high demand for eggs, which spikes this time of year.\n\nEgg demand remains high\n\nPeople buy more eggs around the holidays, when they’re baking and cooking more, and eating breakfast at home more often.\n\nWholesale prices tend to go up in the winter because of those habits, noted Earnest. That has “brought about a very strong market condition.”\n\nYear-round demand for eggs has also also been strong.\n\nEven while prices have soared, sales of eggs have only ticked down about 2% by unit in retail in the year through December 4th, according to data from IRI, a market research firm.\n\nShoppers have been accepting high prices at the grocery store as they pull back on restaurant visits. And even though eggs have gotten more expensive, they still cost less than other proteins.\n\nA deadly avian flu has led to the death of millions of poultry this year. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAs that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.\n\n“Based on current trade values and market conditions, it appears that the market may have finally reached its peak,” said Rispoli. Friday’s wholesale prices were the same as Thursday’s, the first time pricing held steady since October, she said.\n\n“Several suppliers have reported to us… that they are seeing their orders slow,” in the week leading up to Christmas, she added. By then, “most grocers have pulled in whatever inventory they’ll need for the holidays.”\n\nIt might take another three to six months for prices to moderate in retail, said KK Davey, president of thought leadership at IRI and NPD, and even longer for prices to come down to what they were last year.\n\n“It may take some more time,” he said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/14/cost-living-inflation-increase-food-pantry-services-cape-cod-ma/10004270002/", "title": "Food pantries increase services, clientele as inflation takes bigger ...", "text": "Michael Mecenas used to get fresh produce from the Family Table Collaborative in South Yarmouth once a week for the immigrant families served by his organization, the Health Ministry Inc. in Hyannis.\n\nBut with inflation taking a bigger bite out of food budgets and gas prices rising, Mecenas now delivers celery, cherries, red peppers and other donated surplus fruits and vegetables to families' doorsteps three times a week.\n\nFamilies and individuals using the The Family Pantry of Cape Cod in Harwich used to have to wait two weeks between visits.\n\nAbout two months ago, the rules changed to allow visits once very 10 days, and that may decrease to seven days in the near future, Family Pantry Executive Director Christine Menard said.\n\n“We just changed it because the need is growing,\" Menard said.\n\n“It’s much more difficult for our families now than it was during the pandemic,\" she said.\n\n'Trying to be lean where we can':Record-high inflation makes Cape Cod living difficult\n\nAid has dried up, but inflation and the cost of living are increasing.\n\n“They tell us all the time they can’t get the food they need because (the price is) so high,\" Menard said.\n\nFood is in short supply for those in need, according to advocates\n\nNonprofit organizations that provide groceries and food to Cape Codders in need are expanding services and taking on more clients in the face of an economic climate that is taking a particularly heavy toll on service industry workers and older people who make up much of the Cape's population.\n\n\"We have seen a very large increase in demand from a number of households who need food. We have seen a 38% increase in the number of households in need over the last year,\" said Kerin Delaney, executive director of the Falmouth Service Center.\n\n​From January to May, the service center distributed 31,391 bags of food to 1,379 households representing 3,647 individuals, Delaney said.\n\nDuring the same five months in 2021, the service center gave out just over 25,000 bags of food to 997 households representing 2,617 individuals, she said.\n\nIncreased need for food driven by loss of pandemic aid as costs rise, advocates say\n\nFood pantry executives say the increased need is being driven by the loss of pandemic government aid to families and individuals at a time of rising costs.\n\nPeople living and working on the Cape have taken a steady series of hits to the pocketbook, said Menard, whose pantry serves about 500 families a week from Provincetown to Fall River.\n\n'Stop robbing the public':Massachusetts gas station owner stops selling gas amid soaring prices\n\n“The first hit was the aid to the pandemic ending.

It marks the first meeting at which the central bank hasn’t raised its federal funds rate since January 2022.\n\nWatch the Fed media live conference: https://www.federalreserve.gov/live-broadcast.htm\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nHow high will interest rates go in 2023?\n\nFed policymakers estimate they’ll push up the key rate by another half percentage point to a range of 5.5% to 5.75% in 2023, according to their median forecast. Financial markets and many economists expected the Fed to forecast just one more quarter point hike in July. That still would have been higher than the peak rate Fed officials predicted in March.\n\nBy next year, however, the central bank expects to cut rates to 4.6% amid a weak economy and lower inflation.\n\n“Holding the target range steady at this meeting allows the (Fed) to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,” the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting.\n\n\"As we get closer and closer to our destination (the peak rate), it's reasonable, it's common sense to go a little slower,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference.\n\nThe central bank added that it will determine “the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate” to lower inflation to the Fed’s 2% target based on the lags with which its rate hikes affect the economy, inflation and economic and financial developments. Inflation is running at 4.4%, according to the Fed’s preferred measure.\n\nThe Fed’s decision to stand pat is set to provide a reprieve to consumers who have been socked with steady increases in rates for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans. Yet Americans, especially seniors, have benefited from the hikes by finally reaping higher bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nFederal Reserve Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) report\n\nTwo more quarter point bumps are possible because officials expect faster growth and more persistent inflation than they previously forecast..\n\nOfficials expect their preferred measure of annual inflation to decline from 4.4% in April to 3.2% by year-end, below the March estimate of 3.3%, according to their’ median forecast. But a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed follows more closely is expected to close out the year at 3.9%, above from the prior 3.6% estimate.\n\n\"What we'd like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and begging to come down,\" Powell said. \"We have to get inflation down to 2% and we will but we just don't see that.\"\n\nHe added, \"Perhaps more restraint (through higher rates)will be necessary than we thought at the last meeting.\"\n\nThe economy is expected to grow a modest 1% in 2023, more rapidly than the previous 0.4% projection, and 1.1% next year.\n\nAnd the 3.7% unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4.1% by the end of the year, below the 4.5% previously forecast.\n\nAfter lifting rates at 10 straight meetings since March 2022 – by a total 5 percentage points -- Fed officials have been split over whether to pause Wednesday or continue to push rates higher.\n\nLast month, Powell suggested there was a good chance they would take a break to assess the delayed effects of a hiking campaign that most forecasters believe will cause a mild recession this year.\n\nPowell also said deposit runs that sparked the collapse of three regional banks have toughened lending standards and could further ding growth, leaving the Fed less work to do.\n\nBut he said the Fed’s actions would depend on how the economy evolves.\n\nHow is the economy in the U.S. right now?\n\nA report Tuesday revealed that another inflation measure – the consumer price index—showed a significant slowdown in May to 4% annually from 4.9% in April and a 40-year high of 9.1% last June. But a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items advanced sharply from April, keeping the yearly rise elevated at 5.3%.\n\nAlso, employers added a booming 339,000 jobs in May. Annual wage growth ticked down from 4.4% to 4.3% but that’s still historically high and could continue to fuel inflation as employers pass higher labor costs to consumers.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity, also has been robust as households rely on pandemic era savings to offset high borrowing costs and inflation.\n\nThe persistence of inflation has led some Fed policymakers to call Wednesday’s decision to stand pat a “skip” rather than a “pause,” noting a July increase was a good bet.\n\nOthers have noted the biggest impacts from the Fed’s rate increases so far have yet to be felt. They also expect inflation to fall substantially closer to the Fed’s 2% goal by the end of the year as rent increases slow. They believe the Fed should stand down to avoid a recession.\n\nDespite the Fed's forecasts, some economists say a slowdown in both economy and inflation will convince the central bank to stop short of two more rate increases.\n\n\"We think that weaker activity and employment, together with more encouraging signs that core inflation is moderating, will ultimately persuade the Fed that is doesn’t need a final hike in September,\" economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients..\n\nWas there already a recession?\n\nNo. During the pandemic, households accumulated about $2.5 trillion in excess savings from hunkering down at home and trillions of dollars in federal stimulus checks aimed at keeping workers afloat through layoffs and business closures.\n\nAs a result, Americans have a big cushion of savings to help them weather high inflation and interest rates. They’ve whittled down much of that extra cash but about $1.5 trillion still remains, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nConsumers also still have lots of pent-up demand to travel, go to ballgames and dine out now that the health crisis has waned. So while consumption has weakened, rising just 1% annualized at the end of last year, it bounced back and grew 3.8% in the first three months of the year.\n\nAlso, both households and businesses have historically low amounts of debt, Moody’s says, and so they’re not weighed down by high monthly debt service payments.\n\nWhen is the next Fed meeting on interest rates for 2023?\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet on July 25 and 26.\n\nPowell said central bank officials haven't decided what to do with interest rates at the July meeting.\n\n\"We didn't make a decision about July,\" he said at a press conference. \"I do expect that it will be a live meeting.\"\n\nWill interest rates go down in 2024?\n\nPowell said Wednesday \"nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year.\"\n\n\"It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace, but we have made no decision about a hike or pause at the July meeting,\" he said.\n\nThe expectation is that the Fed will gradually cut interest rates beginning in early 2024, according to Gabriel Ehrlich, director of University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics. The Fed could cut rates sooner if the economy slides into recession or if inflation moves into the 2% range, he told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nDow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 plus 10-year Treasury note\n\nStocks fell after the Fed rate pause was announced but the major indexes shook off the doldrums during Powell’s press conference.\n\nThe S&P 500 finished up 0.1% and the Nasdaq rose 0.4%. The Dow industrials fell 0.7% and the Russell 2000 fell 1.3%.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.796%. The two-year yield increased to 4.707%.\n\nWhat is the BTC price?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin was largely unaffected by the Fed rate hike pause. The price remained steady, ranging between $25,000 and $26,000.\n\nHow will CD rates be affected by the Fed?\n\nCD yields have soared in the past year as the Fed boosted interest rates, and more rate hikes would probably continue to make CDs more lucrative, particularly on short-term deposits.\n\nBut if the Fed pauses rate increases as many economists expect, banks will likely do the same and limit CD rate hikes.\n\nOn the other hand, if the economy - which has proven resilient - avoids a recession, CD rates may start to inch up, especially those with longer-term rates.\n\nHousing interest rates today\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate on Wednesday is 7.13% while a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.30%. For 30-year jumbo mortgages, rates are 6.83%.\n\nMortgage rates for a 30-year fixed-rate loans have dropped from 7.24% last week, according to data from Curinos. Those rates sat at 7.01% last month. The 30-year fixed-rate average on Wednesday is 1.12 percentage points below the 52-week peak of 8.25% and 1.25 percentage points higher than the 52-week trough of 5.88%.\n\nTreasury bonds interest rate\n\nIn the bond market, yields on the 10-year Treasury were up 3.79% prior to the Fed announcing its interest rate decision. Treasury bonds help set rates for mortgages and other important loans.\n\nWill rents continue to go down?\n\nMaybe.\n\n“At the beginning of this year, landlords were beginning to drop rents. And that means that leases that are coming online now in June, for example, would reflect those lower rents,’’ says Bright MLS Economist Lisa Sturtevant. “If rents indeed are coming down in a systematic way, we should see that reflected in the CPI as we head through the summer.”\n\nBut there’s also the possibility that rents may not drop by much.“ As the economy has been changing and landlords have been sort of reevaluating, we may see them keeping rents firmer than we thought they would, because of this increased demand for rental units,” she says.\n\nWhy is there a disconnect between current rents and CPI shelter costs?\n\nOnce again, housing costs were the biggest contributors to inflation, according to data from the CPI. Overall shelter costs were 8% higher than a year ago and rent inflation was 8.7% according to the report.\n\nBut private-sector indexes like Redfin, Zillow and Redfin say rent prices are weakening. So what’s the disconnect?\n\nRents slipped 1% nationwide in May as compared to a year earlier −the steepest drop since 2020−as a building boom boosted supply and anxiousness about the economy cooled demand, according to Redfin.\n\nBut the bureau measures changes in the cost of housing for both renters and homeowners as well as lodging away from home and tenants’ and household insurance. The cost to rent a primary residence is weighted the most.\n\nIf a housing unit’s owners live there, the bureau computes what it would cost the owner to rent a similar place, known as Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER). The CPI program collects rent data from each rental unit every six months since rents are locked in place for a given lease term. It also allows for a larger sample, according to the Bureau of Labor Services (BLS).\n\nHowever, in a fast moving, volatile housing market, that gauge can seem outdated compared to private indexes that look at current leases.\n\nAre we in a recession?\n\nMost top economists say no. Housing sales are flagging and home prices are beginning to dip because of steep mortgage rates. Manufacturing activity has also contracted seven months in row, partly because high interest rates have crimped business capital spending.\n\nBut consumer spending, which makes up roughly 70% of GDP, has been surprisingly robust, rising 0.5% in April after adjusting for inflation. And the most important economic indicator, employment, also remains strong, with the public and private sector adding an average of 283,000 positions each month from March through May. Businesses are also keeping their staffs intact instead of laying them off, despite dwindling sales.\n\nTaking all those factors into account, the bottom line is the economy is slowing down, but it’s not shrinking. GDP grew at a 1.3% annual rate in the first quarter, and it’s forecast to grow 1% in the current quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nFed dot plot\n\nDot plots are the way the Fed indicates its benchmark federal funds interest rate outlook at some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. FOMC members put dots on a chart pinpointing their projections for interest rates in upcoming years.\n\nS&P and Nasdaq\n\nMarkets were mixed in morning trading as investors awaited the Fed’s interest rate decision. The S&P 500 was up 0.19% and the Nasdaq rose 0.13%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down slightly by 0.27%.\n\nFed rate hike history\n\nAt the Fed’s last meeting in May, the Central Bank increased interest rates to a range of 5% to 5.25%, it’s tenth hike in a row.\n\nThe constant stream of increases is in sharp contrast to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when rates hovered near zero as the economy ground to a virtual halt. In March 2022, the rate was bumped up to a quarter percentage point. In May, it increased by 0.50 percentage point, followed by four hikes in a row of 0.75% percentage point each.\n\nThe last hike of 2022 was half a percentage point.\n\nWhat is the U.S. inflation rate month by month?\n\nThe Inflation rate has dropped by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. Here's a look at the inflation rate in the U.S. by month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\n8.6% June 2022: 9.1%\n\n9.1% July 2022: 8.5%\n\n8.5% Aug 2022: 8.3%\n\n8.3% Sept 2022: 8.2%\n\n8.2% Oct 2022: 7.7%\n\n7.7% Nov 2022: 7.1%\n\n7.1% Dec 2022: 6.5%\n\n6.5% Jan 2023: 6.4%\n\n6.4% Feb 2023: 6.0%\n\n6.0% Mar 2023: 5.0&\n\n5.0& Apr 2023: 4.9%\n\n4.9% May 2023: 4.0%\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is focused on two key elements of the economy: price stability and maximum employment. And those are the primary drivers of its interest-rate decisions. While its inflation target is roughly 2%, the Fed also takes the CPI into account to decide if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a gauge of the average change in prices for certain products and services during a period of time according to the Bureau of Labor Services.\n\nWill mortgage rates be affected by Fed's rate decision?\n\nWhile mortgage rates doubled following the first few rate hikes last year, the most recent increases have had very little impact.\n\n“Each month when the Federal Reserve has raised rates most of the time the mortgage market has already baked in those rate increases because it's been very clear what the Federal Reserve had intended to do,” says Bright MLS Economist Lisa Sturtevant.\n\nStill, anything that introduces uncertainty into the economy can cause mortgage rates to fluctuate.\n\nHousing interest rates\n\nMortgage rates have been trending roughly the same across the board. Here were the average mortgage rates on June 13:\n\n30-year fixed: 7.19%\n\n15-year fixed: 6.36%\n\n30-year jumbo: 6.84%\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 7.19% on Tuesday, lower than last week's 7.24%, according to data from Curinos, but an uptick from last month’s 6.88%. Last year around the same time, 30-year fixed rates were 5.02%, which makes Tuesday’s rate significantly higher than it was a year ago.\n\nAt the current 30-year fixed rate, you'll pay about $678 each month for every $100,000 you borrow — down from about $681 last week.\n\nCurrent Fed funds rate\n\nIn May, the Fed hiked the key rate to a range of 5% to 5.25%, the highest in 17 years. Since the central bank raised the rate from close to zero in March 2022, hikes have been constant, with the Fed boosting the rate nine more times to ease inflation which reached a four-decade high last June in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWill the Fed cut interest rates?\n\nIt’s doubtful that the Fed will cut rates, according to a Vanguard forecast based on a machine learning model. Though markets predict the Fed will clip its rate by more than half a percentage point by the end of 2023 based on bonds and futures contracts prices, Vanguard senior economist Asawari Sathe says that probably will not occur.\n\n“We believe inflation will continue to moderate but remain above 3% through year-end, and unemployment will trend higher to a still reasonable 4.5%,” she said in an investors note. “In that scenario, the Fed cutting its policy rate this year is unlikely.”\n\nVanguard’s model expects the Fed “won’t be in a position to cut rates until the middle of 2024,’’ according to the note.\n\nWhat's the inflation rate?\n\nConsumer prices increased 4% in May, down from 4.9% the previous month, and a four-decade high of 9.1% last June, according to the CPI. That’s the smallest yearly rise since March 2021, and on a monthly basis, prices increased 0.1% following a 0.4% uptick in April.\n\nThough price hikes overall have slowed, the Fed is more anxious about core inflation which stubbornly remains elevated.\n\nDoes the Fed plan to raise interest rates again?\n\nWhile many expect a divided Fed to take a break Wednesday from its stream of rate hikes, economists are struggling to reach consensus on how it will move going forward as the economy remains resilient despite continuing inflation.\n\nBefore the release of a key inflation report Tuesday, some thought the central bank might roll out a quarter-point hike if the acceleration of prices was stronger than expected. Others said they believed rate hikes were done for the year.\n\nBarclays predicted the Fed might increase rates again if more than 200,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, and core inflation rose by at least roughly 0.3%.\n\nEmployers blew past that hiring threshold, adding a stunning 339,000 jobs in May. And core prices, which don’t count volatile food and energy items and so better reflect longer-term trends, rose 0.4% for the third-straight month, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI).\n\nThe jobless rate, however, which is calculated from a separate survey of households, bumped up from a five-decade low of 3.4% to 3.7%, according to the Labor Department, the highest it’s been since October. And the annual increase of core prices slipped from 5.5% to 5.3%, the lowest since November 2021.\n\nIf no rate hike, then what?:There may not be a Fed rate hike in June. But, Americans are still paying for the last 10\n\nOverall, inflation slowed for an 11th straight month in May as grocery-price increases eased again and gas more than reversed the previous month’s rise. Consumer prices rose 4% , down from 4.9% in April and a four-decade high of 9.1% last June, according to the CPI. That’s the smallest yearly uptick since March 2021, and on a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1% following a 0.4% bump in April.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/14"}]}

You just don’t know. But the $1.6 million, we know, because of the serial numbers and the amounts she withdrew from the bank.”\n\nNow, an 81-year-old investigative reporter in Arizona has a hunch where at least some of the missing money went. And he thinks the FBI may be hiding key information to protect the reputations of the agency and a deceased former agent he suspects may have kept some of the loot after arresting one of the suspects.\n\nThe scenario laid out by Don Devereux is a doozie, for sure. Some will argue it’s nothing more than a wild notion. Others will see it as the fitting explanation for a fantastical case that has seemingly defied plausibility at every turn.\n\nCentral to Devereux’s claim are public records, including real estate and financial documents, as well as an FBI file detailing the Phoenix field office’s role in the apprehension of the man later convicted of killing Jackson.\n\nAmong the FBI records he obtained last year through a Freedom of Information Act request is a notice that the file was “partially destroyed” in 1993 — something Devereux said he has never encountered in more than 50 previous FOIA requests to the FBI. The agency so far has not provided any explanation for why that part of the file was destroyed, or what the missing documents may have contained.\n\nDevereux said he can’t help but wonder if those missing pages contained information about the possibility of missing money in the Jackson case and whether the bureau believed one of its agents might be involved.\n\nIf his theory seems far-fetched, remember this: So was the tangled series of events that culminated in the summer of 1977 when a pair of FBI agents from Phoenix reported digging up $1.7 million buried under five feet of sand in the desert north of Phoenix.\n\nThe crime\n\nThe killing of Jackson, because of her eccentric lifestyle and the vast amount of money involved, attracted international attention.\n\nIt was reported at the time as — and may still be — the largest cash heist from a residential burglary in U.S. history.\n\nThe case remains one of the most fabled crimes in Indiana history thanks to a cast of characters who seem like they jumped out of the script of a Coen brothers movie:\n\nThe eccentric grocery chain heiress who kept a table set in anticipation of the return of Jesus Christ, who covered doorknobs and heating vents with aluminum foil and stashed millions of dollars in trash bags, toolboxes, dresser drawers and garbage cans.\n\nA pair of bumbling burglars, one characterized as a small-town hick and the other as a streetwise city hustler.\n\nA sheriff nicknamed “Diamond Don,” who wore a jewel-studded vest and bragged about his past gambling exploits.\n\nEven celebrity lawyer F. Lee Bailey.\n\nThen there were the unbelievable — if they hadn’t been true — details and plot twists:\n\nThe crooks’ return to Jackson’s home to cart out even more cash, followed by a bungled attempt to set a fire to cover their tracks.\n\nTheir conspicuous spending sprees in the days after the deadly robbery.\n\nThe discovery of dozens of neatly wrapped gifts Jackson had left in her home with cards saying they were for “Jesus” and “God,” along with an additional $5 million the thieves had left behind.\n\nA flight to Arizona, where one of the burglars buried at least $1.7 million in the desert — possibly in response to advice from Bailey.\n\nThe recovery of that money with the help of a woman who had at least twice married and divorced the suspect.\n\nAnd, the speculation that millions of dollars from Jackson’s cache still remain unaccounted for all these years later.\n\nStash of cash\n\nMarjorie Viola O’Connell Jackson’s money came from her husband Chester Jackson, a businessman and shrewd investor who amassed a fortune before his death in 1970.\n\nChester Jackson’s father, Lafayette Andrew Jackson, founded the Standard Grocery chain that grew to include more than 250 stores in Indianapolis and other cities around the state. Chester Jackson became the company’s president in 1931 after his father was shot and killed during a robbery of the chain’s flagship store in the 400 block of East Washington Street.\n\nJackson sold the chain in 1947 to the National Tea Co., according to the book “Notorious 92: Indiana’s Most Heinous Murders in All 92 Counties” by Andrew E. Stoner. The account says the sale “allowed (Jackson) to buy $14 million in coal stocks, $5 million in municipal bonds, $1 million in cash and Treasury bills, and other investments.”\n\n“In all,” Stoner wrote, “the Jackson estate was worth more than $25 million.”\n\nChester Jackson was still married to his first wife when he met Marjorie O’Connell, former Indianapolis Star reporter and editor Dick Cady wrote in his book about the case, “Scavengers: A True Story of Money, Madness and Murder.”\n\nCady wrote that Marjorie, “who came from a hardscrabble background,” was working at a Murphy’s five-and-dime store in Downtown Indianapolis when they met.\n\nThe couple carried on a not-so-secret affair for years before Jackson finally obtained a divorce, according to the book. They were married — the second for both — in 1952. Two years later the couple, who had no children, purchased the home on Spring Mill.\n\nWhen Chester Jackson died in 1970, Marjorie Jackson inherited an estimated $14 million, depositing most of the money in the Indiana National Bank.\n\nWhat few knew at the time was that Chester Jackson, who didn’t like the IRS, had for years stashed cash at the couple’s home.\n\nBy some accounts, it may have been more than $2 million — but that was only a pittance compared to what was to come.\n\nMarjorie Jackson, who was 60 when her husband died, continued to live at the couple’s home. But as the years went by, she became more reclusive and allowed the property to grow up in tall grass and weeds.\n\nNeighbors, quoted in news stories after her murder, said the widow talked to the birds and animals, practiced bizarre religious rituals, spouted racial epithets and even claimed to grow money out of the ground. She had two new Cadillacs in her garage, including one that she never even bothered to license.\n\nIn 1976, after a bank employee embezzled $700,000, Jackson began withdrawing her savings. She would show up at the bank and demand $500,0000 to $1 million at a time, taking the stacks of $100 bills home in a suitcase or grocery bags.\n\nOver the course of about four months, Jackson withdrew everything she had in the bank. The total was nearly $8 million.\n\nShe hid the money all around her home — in closets, toolboxes, garbage cans and vacuum cleaner bags. The money was interspersed with an odd collection of gifts, from wash cloths to cakes to expensive jewelry, scattered around the house. The neatly wrapped packages had tags that read: “To Jesus Christ from Marjorie Jackson” and “To God from Marjorie.”\n\nIndianapolis attorney Robert “Tommy” Thompson, who worked for the prosecutor’s office at the time, said bank officials, police, a judge and the prosecutor all tried to convince Jackson that keeping so much money at home was a risk. It could, they told Jackson, put her life in danger.\n\nShe told them to mind their own business.\n\nSeveral months before she was murdered, two teens burglarized Jackson’s home. They got away with about $800,000, but she refused to prosecute them — even after one of the thieves confessed to a grand jury.\n\nThompson visited Jackson after that theft and found himself staring down the barrel of a pistol. It was one of the coldest days of the year, Thompson recalled, and Jackson greeted him and several lawmen in the driveway of her home dressed only in a nightgown.\n\nJackson denied any money was taken in the recent break-in at her home. When Thompson said one of the crooks admitted to stealing nearly $800,000, Jackson insisted the man was lying.\n\n“Get off my property,” she instructed Thompson and the others.\n\nThe next time Thompson saw Marjorie Jackson was about four months later. This time, she was lying dead in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor.\n\nThe curious case of the robbery and killing of Jackson began to unfold on May 2, 1977, when an unlikely duo — Howard “Billy Joe” Willard, 38, Mooresville, and Manuel Lee Robinson, 29, Indianapolis — broke into Jackson’s home. The pair left with about $1 million in cash.\n\nThey were, according to Indianapolis attorney John M. Schwartz, a fascinating odd couple.\n\n“You had Robinson, a hip, inner-city black,” Schwartz, who was the deputy prosecutor assigned to Robinson’s case, said in a 1987 story marking the 10th anniversary of the robbery and murder. “And then you had Willard, who I think was just an ignorant hillbilly.”\n\nSchwartz, in an interview for this story, said he has mellowed a bit over the years in his assessment of Willard, calling him “a somewhat unsophisticated guy with a rural background.”\n\nEmboldened by the ease of the first burglary — and the lure of the horde of cash they had left behind — the pair returned to Jackson’s home two days later. This time, they were confronted by the widow, and Willard shot her in the stomach with a .22 rifle.\n\nJackson bled to death — surrounded by the scores of gifts, as well as the fine china and cutlery she laid out in her dining room for her anticipated feast with Jesus.\n\nThe burglars tried to set the home on fire, but the small blazed smoldered for hours before it was discovered and firefighters were called. Jackson’s body was discovered after the fire was extinguished.\n\nAnd despite Willard and Robinson making a return trip to the home, hauling out bags of cash — mostly $100 bills — police found they had left millions behind.\n\nExactly how much money Jackson had hidden, and how much of that money Willard and Robinson got away with, could never be confirmed, said Schwartz, the deputy prosecutor.\n\nBy some estimates, he said, there may have been as much as $15 million stashed at Jackson’s home. More than $5 million was recovered after the fire, Schwartz said, and Willard and Robinson were believed to have taken at least $2 million to $3 million each.\n\n“No one ever really knew how much money she had there,” Schwartz said. “The big open question has always been: Is there more money out there, and where might it be?”\n\nPaid cash for cars\n\nIt didn’t take police long to identify and arrest Willard and Robinson in Jackson’s murder.\n\nThe men got caught, Schwartz said, because they “were spending money like water” in the days and weeks after the robbery.\n\nRobinson’s public defender, Arnold Baratz, said his client and Willard committed a crime almost impossible to solve, then left a trail nearly impossible to miss.\n\n“If they hadn’t set fire to the house,” he said, “(the killing) might not have been detected for months and months because she was such a recluse.”\n\nThe tips that helped break the case came from Indianapolis car dealers. Salesmen became suspicious and alerted police after the men purchased new cars, paying cash. While that wasn’t unheard of at the time, what happened next was: They came back to buy other cars, and again paid in cash.\n\nAfter Robinson was arrested, $1.6 million was found in a suitcase hidden under a bed at his apartment at 20th and Central. He claimed a man had given him the money to keep but denied knowing the person’s name.\n\nAs investigators pressed Robinson about the absurdity of his claim, he eventually said he had the man’s telephone number. It turned out to be the number for the Mooresville home of Willard’s ex-wife and current girlfriend.\n\nWillard and the woman had fled by the time police came to their home but were caught in Arizona. Again, it was their lavish spending that got the couple in trouble. They had paid about $50,000 in cash to buy two used RVs.\n\nWillard was brought back to Indiana, convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He died in June 1987 after collapsing while jogging at the Indiana Reformatory.\n\nHis partner, Robinson, was acquitted on the murder charge but was convicted of burglary and arson. He was released from prison in 1988 but was arrested again in 1990 and sent back to prison for 10 years.\n\nRobinson, who was last thought to be living in Florida, told Cady he believed law enforcement officials had kept about $450,000 of the cash he got in the Jackson robberies, according to Cady’s 2011 book.\n\nBaratz, Robinson’s public defender, said his client had insisted from the start that he still had some of the loot stashed.\n\n“He always claimed,” Baratz said, “that the police never got all of his money.”\n\nBuried treasure\n\nIt was Willard’s ex-wife who led two FBI agents to a spot not far off of I-17 north of Phoenix where they reported finding $1.7 million in cash.\n\nThe recovered money had been hidden in two boxes buried in the desert.\n\nAt Willard’s trial, according to Cady’s book, the woman testified that celebrity attorney Bailey advised Willard to divide up the money and bury it in several locations to protect the couple from thugs wanting to get their hands on the stash.\n\nThat testimony, Cady wrote, prompted Bailey to issue a statement.\n\n“I told him (Willard) I would represent him only if he would surrender and return the money,” the statement said. “ ... I suggested for the safety of the child (who was traveling with them) he place the money somewhere for safe keeping while I negotiated his surrender and not keep the money in the camper.”\n\nAccording to Devereux’s theory, one of the FBI agents may have found much more cash than they reported — and spirited it off to a Swiss bank account.\n\nThe FBI file indicates the recovered money came from only one location. Devereux said it is possible the agent skimmed some money from that find, or went back into the desert later and dug up money from other locations where Willard may have buried it.\n\nYears later, after the investigator had retired, Devereux suspects the money was transferred back to the agent from the Swiss bank account, coming through a Caribbean tax haven, and then used to purchase valuable real estate in Phoenix.\n\nDevereux has property and other financial records in the former agent’s name that show money transferred from Switzerland to the Netherlands Antilles was used to purchase property in the agent’s name. That property was then transferred back to an off-shore holding company he suspects was associated with a trust established by the now-deceased agent.\n\n“The crucial question,” Devereux wrote in a letter to the FBI in April, “... should be whether the ultimate source of those funds was the money still ostensibly missing from the Jackson robbery/homicide.”\n\nTaking no action\n\nDevereux strung together his fantastical scenario after getting a tip from a source in law enforcement.\n\nThe source told the veteran investigative reporter, who twice has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, that it seemed odd some of the stolen loot appeared to be missing even though both suspects cooperated with authorities.\n\n“Something about that struck him as weird,” Devereux said. “So, as a favor, I did a FOIA request with the FBI.”\n\nThe records Devereux received from the FBI contained a bombshell: the name of one of the FBI agents who recovered the money was not redacted. And it wasn’t just once. The name showed up six times in the records, something Devereux said, based on his years of dealing with FBI files, “seemed extraordinary.”\n\nHe took it as a sign that someone in the Phoenix FBI office also had suspicions about the agent, whose name typically would have been blacked out in the documents made public.\n\n“Once is an oversight,” Devereux said. “Six times is a message. At least, that’s how I took it.”\n\nAfter learning part of the case filed had been destroyed, Devereux asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate.\n\n“The whole thing,” he said, “leaps out at you as irregular. And even though we’re talking about something that happened a long time ago, I don’t believe that is any excuse to ignore it now.”\n\nIn March, the FBI sent Devereux a letter informing him the agency’s Internal Investigations Section — the entity responsible for investigating allegations of serious misconduct against agents — is taking no action on his request.\n\n“However, your information was provided to the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, as well as the FBI Phoenix field office, for appropriate action,” the letter said.\n\nDevereux said he understands that “appropriate action” is an investigation, but he still is waiting for the agency to provide an explanation for why part of the file was destroyed, what it involved, and the source of the money the agent obtained from Switzerland.\n\nAn FBI spokesman in Phoenix told The Star he had no information on Devereux’s request.\n\nKoers, 69, the nephew of Jackson, said he’s intrigued by Devereux’s theory.\n\n“You just don’t know,” said Koers, who worked in the Indianapolis Police Department crime lab at the time of the robbery and murder.\n\nKoers still fondly recalls Marjorie and Chester Jackson. They were the “rich aunt and uncle” he and his siblings would visit. Marjorie and his mother had the same mother but different fathers, and grew up together on North Oxford Street.\n\nHe said Marjorie Jackson may have been eccentric, but she was not insane at the time of her death. A judge, who was asked by bankers to block her huge withdrawals months before she was killed, agreed she was competent.\n\nKoers was not actively involved in the murder investigation, which was headed up by the Sheriff’s Department, but said he was called to the scene to identify the body.\n\nHe also watched as police and firefighters gathered up the boxes and bags of money that Willard and Robinson left behind. That night, he accompanied sheriff “Diamond Don” Gilman back to the sheriff’s office with all the money.\n\nThe sheriff asked Koers to spend the night in his office to keep an eye on the money until it could be put somewhere more safe.\n\n“I slept on the couch in the office,” Koers said, “but I’m not sure I slept all that much.”\n\nNearly 40 years later, the retired police officer is conflicted by the possibility another lawman would have skimmed some of the money stolen from his aunt.\n\n“I’m not accusing the FBI agent of anything,” he said. “But it sounds like there could be something to it, so I think it is something that should be looked into.”\n\nStar Researcher Cathy Knapp and Visuals Coordinator Dawn Mitchell contributed to this story.\n\nCall Tim Evans at (317) 444-6204 and follow him on Twitter: @starwatchtim.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/us/rapper-deaths-gun-violence-reaj/index.html", "title": "Gun violence has killed at least 1 rapper every year since 2018 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s happened again: America wakes up to news that a hip-hop star was fatally and senselessly shot. This time, the rapper is Takeoff of Atlanta’s platinum hit machine, Migos, who was slain early Tuesday in Houston, according to a source close to the group.\n\nHouston police responded to the scene of a downtown shooting at a bowling alley and pool hall, finding one person dead, the department said. Two other victims were taken in private vehicles to hospitals.\n\nTakeoff’s death is the latest in a trend that stretches back to 2018. Each year since then, gun violence – whether through robbery or disagreement – has killed at least one rapper who was either already famous or on the cusp of crossover fame.\n\nThe 28-year-old rhymesmith, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had just released a project with his uncle and Migos bandmate, Quavo, titled, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” the album’s name a shoutout to the 1995 debut solo effort from Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon. Quavo and Takeoff had recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, “Unc & Phew.”\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.” On Friday, he tweeted about performing in Miami.\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast, “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”\n\nIn addition to his work with Quavo and Migos, Takeoff released a solo album in 2018, “The Last Rocket,” which hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nFrom left, Takeoff, DJ Mustard and Quavo perform at the BET Awards in Los Angeles in 2019. Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nNews of Takeoff’s killing rocked hip-hop, but his loss is being felt well beyond the bounds of music as many chimed in to offer condolences and praise, while others questioned what needs to be done to stop the scourge of rappers being killed.\n\n“Too many young men of color are killing each other,” tweeted Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Resolving their disputes by pulling their guns and shooting one another regardless of fame or fortune. Crazy. And in a few second a life is gone, families and friends are left grieving. STOP!”\n\nJournalist Jewel Wicker offered some additional career insight from an interview with Takeoff’s uncle, writing, “Takeoff, the then-kid who convinced his uncle (Quavo) to start rapping then helped change the flow of rap. The undisputed best rapper in Migos (his uncle told me so himself just a few months ago). What a loss.” She further reported Takeoff earned his stage name from his ability to “just launch into his verses and record everything in a single, pristine take.”\n\nFellow writer Jemele Hill added, “I was in college when Biggie and ‘Pac were killed and thought there was no way we’d ever experience anything remotely close to that again. Now it’s happening so frequently that you barely have time to recover before someone else killed. RIP Takeoff.”\n\nRapper Ja Rule felt similarly, writing, “this s**t has to STOP,” while fellow rap star, Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nRolling Stone Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman tweeted out a 2015 article in which Takeoff spoke of his dedication to his craft.\n\n“You couldn’t tell me I wasn’t going to be who I was,” he said. “I knew I was going to be here.”\n\nTakeoff now joins the list of rappers who were victims of gun violence. Here are some other notable artists killed since 2018:\n\n2018: XXXTentacion\n\nXXXTentacion, seen here in 2017, found fame after going viral on social media. Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock\n\nXXXTentacion was gunned down June 18, 2018, in an apparent robbery as he left a motorsports store in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\nFour men were arrested that year in connection with the rapper’s killing. They were indicted on murder and other charges, and one suspect pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is expected to testify against the other three, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.\n\nThe 20-year-old was wildly popular at the time of his death. He rocketed to fame after his song, “Look at Me,” went viral on social media and SoundCloud in 2016.\n\nHe went on to be featured in XXL magazine’s 2017 Freshman Class alongside other up-and-coming artists. His album “?” premiered at No. 1 when it was released in March 2018, according to Billboard.\n\nThe album’s single “Sad!” peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks on the charts, according to Billboard.\n\nRight after his death, “Sad!” moved from No. 52 to No. 1 on Billboard ‘s Hot 100 chart. The song was the first posthumous No. 1 for a lead soloist since The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” in 1997, according to Billboard.\n\nThe rapper was not without controversy: He was accused of homophobia after telling a story on a podcast of choking and severely beating a cellmate he suspected was gay while they both were housed in a juvenile detention center. He had also been awaiting trial for a domestic violence incident involving his pregnant girlfriend.\n\n2019: Nipsey Hussle\n\nNipsey Hussle was fatally shot in March 2019 near a clothing store he owned. Shutterstock\n\nNipsey Hussle, an award-winning hip-hop artist and philanthropist, was shot at least 10 times on March 31, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rapper’s last message on Twitter read: “Having strong enemies is a blessing.” It was later found that a conversation about snitching preceded his fatal shooting, according to grand jury testimony.\n\nAuthorities said Eric Holder fired the shots that killed Nipsey and wounded two other people. Holder, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the rapper’s death. According to numerous hip-hop publications, his September sentencing date was postponed to this month.\n\nNipsey had been well-known on the underground circuit, and he was gaining a mainstream following just before his death.\n\nA year earlier, he launched the first Marathon Clothing smart store in Los Angeles. Nipsey also owned The Marathon Agency marketing company, investment firm SC Commercial Ventures and the record labels Proud 2 Pay and All Money In No Money Out Records, according to Press Atlantic Records.\n\nThe 33-year-old was nominated for best rap album during the 2019 Grammys for the only studio album he ever released, “Victory Lap.” He lost to Cardi B.\n\nBeyond his music and businesses, Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips but spoke out against rappers who would boast of purported gang affiliations to stunt or look cool – not because he wished them any violence, but to remind them that for too many young people, joining a gang was about survival.\n\n2020: Pop Smoke\n\nPop Smoke died the month before he was scheduled to go on tour. Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images\n\nNew York rapper Pop Smoke was fatally shot during a home invasion at a Hollywood Hills, California, residence February 19, 2020.\n\nSeveral people were detained and released following the rapper’s death. Witnesses told investigators that between two and six people broke into the home, one of them wearing a mask, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Steve Lurie said.\n\nFive people were arrested in connection with the slaying, two of whom were identified as juveniles.\n\nThe 20-year-old was enjoying the success of his sophomore mixtape, “Meet the Woo 2,” the week before his killing. The project debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 album charts.\n\nPop’s “Meet the Woo” tour was scheduled to kick off with a sold-out show in Washington, DC, on March 2, 2020.\n\nHis posthumous album, “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” was released in July 2020.\n\nIn a 2019 New York Times profile, the artist talked about his life before he found fame, describing his teen years as “high-risk, high-reward.”\n\n2020: King Von\n\nRapper King Von was killed outside a hookah lounge in Atlanta, Georgia. Prince Williams/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nChicago rapper King Von was one of two people fatally shot November 6, 2020, during an early morning exchange of gunfire outside an Atlanta hookah lounge, authorities said.\n\nTwo groups of men had been arguing in a parking lot around 3:30 a.m. and shots were fired, authorities said.\n\nFour other people were wounded by gunfire, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which investigated the shooting because police officers also fired their weapons.\n\nTimothy Leeks, 22, was arrested in connection with the rapper’s death. The Atlanta Police Homicide Unit had arrest warrants against Leeks for felony murder. Two other men were also taken into custody in connection to the shooting, according to CNN affiliate WXIA-TV.\n\nA week before his death, Von had released his debut studio album, “Welcome to O’Block.” His posthumous sophomore album, “What It Means to Be King,” was released March 4, 2022, and debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, according to Billboard.\n\n2021: Young Dolph\n\nRapper Young performed during the Astroworld Festival on November 9, 2019 in Houston, Texas. SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMemphis-based rapper Young Dolph was fatally shot while buying cookies November 17, 2021.\n\nThe 36-year-old rapper was at Makeda’s Homemade Butter Cookies in Memphis when someone drove up and shot him, police said at the time.\n\nThree men were arrested in connection with Dolph’s death. Authorities identified them as Justin Johnson, 23, Shondale Barnett, 27, and Cornelius Smith, 32.\n\nMemphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said additional arrests were possible as the investigation into Young Dolph’s death continues. Citizens’ tips were key in capturing the suspects, she said.\n\nDolph, a Chicago native who grew up in Memphis, released his debut album, “King of Memphis,” in 2016.\n\nHe went on to perform several hits, including “Blue Diamonds” and “RNB” featuring Megan Thee Stallion. His fifth studio album, 2020’s “Rich Slave,” rose to No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIn 2017, he was nearly killed in a shooting incident in Hollywood. He spent weeks hospitalized after sustaining three gunshot wounds.\n\nDolph told The Guardian in a 2018 interview that he wasn’t “a person that lives in fear.” He is survived by two children.\n\n2022: PnB Rock\n\nPnB Rock performs during a 2019 festival in Anaheim. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images/File\n\nThe death of rapper PnB Rock in Los Angeles stunned the hip-hop community but brought up familiar conversations that have been taking place for years.\n\nThe rapper was shot September 12 while eating with his girlfriend at Roscoe’s House of Chicken ‘N Waffles in what appears to be a robbery, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore. Notably, Moore said a picture of the pair’s meal had been posted on Instagram, with the location tagged.\n\nIn September, police announced they had charged three people in connection with the killing, including a father and his minor son, who were charged with murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and second-degree robbery, according to the local prosecutor. A woman was charged with being an accessory after the fact.\n\nThe minor appeared in juvenile court Thursday and is set to return for a preliminary hearing on October 19. The woman is expected to be arraigned Thursday afternoon.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/entertainment/pnb-rock-killing-suspects-arrest\n\n“The ppl around these rappers gain so much. It’s time to start really reminding them over & over!!! At least TRY to put your foot down if you CARE! Tell them!!! You’re not loved like you think you are!!! You’re prey!!!! In a world full of predators!!!! What’s not clicking???!!!” rapper Nicki Minaj tweeted after PnB Rock’s death.\n\nHer tweets and the organic conversations among other artists and fans on social media speak to common issues in hip-hop: masculinity, security and handling rising fame.\n\n“The amount of non reported robbery attempts dealing with rappers are ridiculous.. hella rappers don’t even speak on it cuz some feel it’s embarrassing to admit or speak on. Rappers literally being targeted out there and ppl trying em in broad daylight,” podcast host and entertainer DJ Akademiks tweeted.\n\nPnB Rock previously spoke with Ak about an attempted robbery when he was out with his girlfriend and daughter.

A 17-year-old male in an orange hoodie had fired nine rounds from a handgun into Blair’s car before running off.\n\nWhile an off-duty nurse in scrubs who’d been at the gas station tried to stop his bleeding, Marnette — a heart-transplant recipient — couldn’t bear to watch and stood at a distance. Telly was her caretaker.\n\n“It was just horrible to see him sitting there, waiting on the ambulance,” she told CNN.\n\nThe 12-year-old called 911 while watching her uncle struggle to breathe.\n\n“Oh my God, please,” the girl, who was crying, said to a dispatcher, according to 911 transcripts of the August 9, 2021 shooting obtained by CNN. “Hurry up, hurry up, hurry, hurry, he’s dead, hurry up!”\n\nTelly Blair was among 93 people who were murdered in Minneapolis last year, city crime data shows. That’s just a few shy of the total killings in 1995, when the city earned the nickname “Murderapolis.” (Neighboring St. Paul witnessed 38 murders last year — a historic high.)\n\nA photo of Telly Blair and his mother, Marnette, rests on a table in their home in north Minneapolis. Marnette Gordon, 61, mother of Telly Blair, 36, who lost his life to gun violence in north Minneapolis, photographed in her home.\n\nAfter the police murder of George Floyd in May of 2020, Minneapolis became a worldwide symbol of the police brutality long endured disproportionately by Black people. In a kind of Newtonian response, the city became the epicenter of the culturally seismic “Defund the Police” movement. But that progressive local effort fizzled with a decisive referendum last November.\n\nNow, with its police department under investigation by the Department of Justice, the city of 425,000 is trying to find a way forward amid a period of heightened crime that began shortly after Floyd’s death.\n\nThat year, the number of murders soared to nearly 80 — dwarfing the 2019 body count of 46. It has cooled somewhat this year, though the amount of killing — and violent crime in general — remains elevated far above 2019 levels and homicides are on pace to surpass the 2020 figure. The reasons why are far from clear.\n\nKG Wilson, a longtime resident of the Twin Cities, said police withdrew from violent neighborhoods in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing — a common sentiment among locals.\n\n“The criminals were celebrating. They were getting rich,” he said. “They were selling drugs openly.”\n\nWilson told CNN the violence devastated his own family: His 6-year-old granddaughter was killed in May of 2021 after getting caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in north Minneapolis. The culprit remains at large.\n\nAnother factor was the pandemic, which some observers see as the biggest impetus for the crime surge.\n\n“It unsettled settled trajectories,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. “Kids who were going to school, who would have graduated but drifted off because there is no school — we’re seeing a lot of the violent crime is by juveniles.”\n\nCiting sinking morale in the wake of the unrest after Floyd’s killing, leaders at the Minneapolis Police Department say the officer head count has shrunk from 900 in early 2020 to about 560 in August — a loss of more than a third of the force.\n\nKG Wilson created a memorial for his granddaughter Aniya Allen in his SUV. The car seat cover of her face rests on the seat where she would ride with him. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the political pendulum on public-safety matters in this reliably liberal city — the “Mini Apple” hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1973, and that was for just a single day — seems to have swung away from a progressive mindset towards the middle.\n\nAnd on matters of public safety, the middle is where many of the city’s Black residents already were.\n\nLast year, progressives touted a ballot measure that was said to be a referendum on the “defund” concept. Question 2, as it was known locally, would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new “public health-oriented” Department of Public Safety and removed a minimum staffing requirement from the city charter.\n\nIt failed in November, with 56% of voters rejecting it. That figure was 61% in north Minneapolis, a pair of neighboring city wards where Blacks make up a strong plurality of the roughly 66,000 residents. All but one of the 17 precincts in the north voted against the measure.\n\n“We did not believe that the police should be defunded, but we do believe in police reforms,” said Bishop Richard Howell of Shiloh Temple, a north-side church founded more than 90 years ago.\n\nRae McKay-Anderson — Telly Blair’s sister — said “you can’t possibly defund the police in a way that’s going to benefit the Black community.”\n\nDealing the final blow to the local “defund” movement last year was a city council vote to essentially refund a cut they’d made the prior year. Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing another budget bump for the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe question of the moment is, if the police budget has been restored, and if all the anti-cop shouting by politicians and activists that left officers demoralized has weakened to a whimper, why are citizens — especially in the rough parts of north Minneapolis — still feeling neglected by police and fearful for their safety?\n\nA feeling of lawlessness, a sense of neglect\n\nResidents of the north side describe a landscape that can feel lawless. Indeed, about 60% of police calls for shots fired this year have come from the area, even though it makes up just 15% of the population, according to city data.\n\nPaul Johnson, 56, said young men openly sell drugs during the day in public places, such as a gas station on Broadway Avenue that has been dubbed the “murder station” due to all of the fatal shootings there. (It is near the one where Blair was killed.)\n\n“You pull up to get gas – they try to sell you drugs,” he said. “And not just three or four, but it’s a bulk of people.”\n\nThe perception among many residents is that the police ignore the area.\n\n“They just let it go on,” said Johnson’s friend, Brian Bogan, 42, who said he moved from north Minneapolis to relatively safer St. Paul due to his kids growing up in an area where they don’t know if “it’s fireworks or gunshots.”\n\nA memorial for Aniya Allen lay on the ground of the corner store near where she was shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nWhile Minneapolis is far from the nation’s most dangerous city, its rate of increase in homicides — the count in 2021 was about double that of 2019 — is among the highest in the nation, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri- St. Louis and co-author of an annual study on crime trends.\n\nOn per-capita murders, it has ranked fairly high — 19th out of 70 jurisdictions in the US — during the first half of this year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association. The city ranked even higher on other per-capita crime measures, such as robbery (4th), rape (8th) and aggravated assault (13th).\n\nJuliee Oden, 56, can’t even count the times she has called 911 to report gunfire outside her north-side home. One night last summer, a volley of shots jolted her out of bed while she was watching TV — it was coming from her front lawn.\n\n“I hit the floor,” she said. “My phone went flying. I had to crawl on my stomach to get to the phone” to dial 911.\n\nIt got to the point where it was hard to sleep at night and Oden, who works at a construction company, had colleagues install a bulletproof panel behind the headboard of her bed.\n\n“Now I go in my room with complete confidence,” she said. “If somebody is to shoot directly at my house, I know: As long as I’m behind my headboard, I’m 100% safe.”\n\nOden was among eight residents in north Minneapolis who filed a lawsuit in the summer of 2020 calling on the city to replenish the police department by filling vacant positions. The suit singled out city council members who supported the “radical ‘dismantle the police’” idea and accused them and Mayor Frey of creating a “hostile” environment for the police. It was largely upheld by a state Supreme Court decision this summer — meaning the city needs to staff up to at least 731 police officers.\n\nDoug Seaton, an attorney representing the eight residents, said the successful suit was filed in direct response to how progressive city council members had embraced the “defund” idea. It demoralized the police department and ultimately led to a mass exodus of officers, he said.\n\n“That is, we think, the major reason that crime has spiked throughout the city and hasn’t gone away yet,” Seaton said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the MPD headcount has shrunk, wait times have grown for people who call 911 to report serious “priority 1” incidents, which can include shots fired, robberies, assaults and mental health crises.\n\nAverage 911 response times jumped the very month of Floyd’s death — May of 2020 — from around 10 or 11 minutes early that year to 14 minutes, according to public records obtained by CNN. They kept rising in 2021 to 16 minutes; response times in the north side’s fourth precinct last year actually surpassed 17 minutes, where they remain.\n\nSome nights are so busy that the dispatchers are directed to hold all non-priority-1 calls citywide; these would include reports of property damage, suspicious persons or theft. That happened during a frenetic five-hour stretch on the night of September 8, when officers responded to multiple shootings and calls for shots fired — many of them in north Minneapolis; one near the “murder station” — that left two dead and seven wounded.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department has even flatly refused to respond to certain crimes in a timely manner. One couple who run a property management business recently took it upon themselves to investigate the theft of their van, box truck and tools by a culprit who brought the stolen goods into a homeless encampment on the north side, according to local news reports.\n\nPolice told KARE 11 that the hostility towards police on the part of some encampment dwellers compels them to take a slower approach when investigating property crimes there.\n\nBut by and large, police officials have said the slower response times are the expected byproduct of a depleted force that has witnessed an overwhelming wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves due to post-traumatic stress.\n\nMuch of that exodus owes to a bottoming out of morale in the wake of a crisis that left police officers feeling reviled, said interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman.\n\n“There’s really been a very fundamental challenge to our sense of purpose in law enforcement,” Huffman said of the post-Floyd era. “(Minneapolis) is the eye of the storm. So all of those challenges and the pressure is magnified, you know, a hundred fold – a thousand fold.”\n\nSimilar headcount plunges have plagued police departments from coast to coast.\n\nSome law enforcement officials have attributed the mass resignations and retirements to pandemic-related reasons, but Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith of the National Police Association said morale is a major factor.\n\n“It’s no secret that law enforcement … especially in the last two and a half years, has been badly vilified and wrongly vilified,” she told CNN. “You can’t call an entire profession racist and expect people to just sit back and say, okay, you know, keep piling on.”\n\nThe gas station where Telly Blair was fatally shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nIn June, the embattled Minneapolis department was hit with more bad press — this time for its abysmal numbers on unsolved murders in recent years.\n\nSince 2016, the clearance rate (or the percentage of homicide cases closed) in Minneapolis sank from around 54% — the most recent national average — to 38% in 2020, according to the latest available data from the FBI. Figures for last year haven’t been released by the FBI, but Huffman insists the rate has improved considerably, claiming that the unofficial figure for this year to date is back to 54%.\n\nEven so, some family members of murder victims say they have felt compelled to take a lead role in the homicide investigations of their own loved ones.\n\nResidents take matters into their own hands\n\nAmong them is Dorothy Royston, a 26-year-old healthcare professional who said she spent weeks proactively feeding police information shortly after her unarmed younger brother, Charles Royston Jr., was gunned down on a snowy street in north Minneapolis on a January night in 2021, according to police reports.\n\n“They had a lot of the information or the logistics of what was – like bullet casings and stuff like that,” Dorothy said. “But when it comes to who was involved with the actual shooting, who was around – and the people information? I actually provided that to the police.”\n\nDorothy provided CNN with text messages between her and a lead investigator on the case. In February of 2021, the investigator told her in a message that there would be a warrant out for the arrest of a suspect by the next day. He still hasn’t been arrested, Dorothy said.\n\nShe said communications from the investigator fell off around March of 2021.\n\nA couple months ago, about a year and a half after the killing, Dorothy said, she called the investigator to ask for an update.\n\n“He told me that he was currently doing something and that he would call me back,” she said. “He never called me back.”\n\n(The investigator agreed to talk with CNN, but a police spokesperson called off the interview. )\n\nTaken together, the current state of crime and policing in Minneapolis — from slow response times to recent brutality complaints to the poor clearance rates — has fostered an atmosphere of distrust.\n\nThe distrust paves the way for some to assume bad intentions. Dave Bicking, a board member of the Minneapolis-based Community United Against Police Brutality, goes so far as to suggest the police since Floyd’s death may have engaged in a “sickout” — that is, that officers are purposefully sluggish to respond to or investigate certain crimes.\n\n“It’s still going on to a considerable extent — it was dramatic in the beginning,” Bicking told CNN. “The police would simply, if they showed up at all, say, ‘Oh, we don’t have anybody to deal with that,’ or ‘You people don’t want us here, so we’re not going to do anything.’”\n\nDave Bicking outside his facility, Communities United Against Police Brutality, in Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nBicking, who has been publicly critical of the “defund” tactic from the get-go, said he bases the sickout claim on a drop-off in jail bookings shortly after Floyd’s death and on more than 2,300 interviews the CUAPB has conducted over the past year and a half with Minneapolis residents about their experiences with the MPD.\n\nHe added that the CUAPB persuaded the Department of Justice to include in its investigation of the MPD the alleged lack of Minneapolis police investigations into murders of people of color.\n\nChief Huffman did not respond to follow-up questions related to sickout allegations, but in her earlier interview with CNN she said Minneapolis has unique challenges.\n\nFor one, she said, Minneapolis has a relatively low rate of domestic murders, which are typically easier to solve, and a high rate of gang murders, which are more difficult.\n\nBut the bigger factor again comes down to attrition. Huffman said the Minneapolis Police Department has lost about 100 investigators in its investigations bureau since early 2020.\n\nStill, Huffman said the MPD is committed to solving homicides, adding that unsolved murders can have serious negative repercussions that ripple through communities for years and devastate families.\n\n“The lack of justice for families who have had family members murdered is completely unacceptable,” she said. “And it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to solve those cases.”\n\nHuffman’s new boss, Cedric Alexander — who was hired in August as the city’s first ever community safety commissioner — said he understands the community’s frustration.\n\n“When you have a body drop and another body drops and another body drops, what you have oftentimes is ongoing violence – it certainly does overwhelm an agency that already is struggling with a great deal of shortages,” he told CNN. “It does give people the perception nothing is being done. But I can assure you that it is. And in any of these violent cases where we have victims, it is taken at a very high priority.”\n\nHow ‘defund’ failed\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is shouted at by protesters at a Defund the Police march in early June of 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux) Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn June of 2020, nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members stood on a stage adorned with an oversized sign saying “DEFUND POLICE.”\n\nAround the same time, in another spectacle that made national news, Mayor Frey was booed and jeered by activists at a George Floyd protest near his home for saying — in response to a question — that he did not support “the full abolition of police.” As he walked away, the crowd broke into a “Go home Jacob!” chant.\n\n“It was a lonely walk,” Frey told CNN recently. “At that moment there was a very loud chorus of people, including elected officials … that were all calling very loudly to defund the police.”\n\nIt’s well established that those widely viewed events boosted a movement in Minneapolis that would later fail at the polls last November. Lesser known is how the very community most directly impacted by crime and policing in the city — the north side — was among the least supportive of the “defund” idea.\n\n“I think what’s at issue is the White progressives’ belief that they’re helping us,” said Lisa Clemons, a former Minneapolis police officer, who is Black and runs a gun-violence organization called A Mother’s Love in north Minneapolis. “Oftentimes they are hurting us.”\n\nClemons said people in north Minneapolis don’t want to get rid of cops – “they just want respectful cops.”\n\nLisa Clemons, a resident of north Minneapolis and former cop, at the Northside Community Center at Cub Foods. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nMinneapolis voters not only resoundingly rejected what was seen as the “defund” initiative, they also voted to strengthen the office of the mayor and reelected Frey, who’d become a local avatar for moderate Democrats put off by the party’s most liberal wing.\n\nThe Minneapolis area with the largest Black population — Ward 5 on the north side — also proved a strong base of support for Frey in his reelection, according to a CNN analysis of voter data.\n\nFrey said that while no demographic group is a monolith, White progressives in the aftermath of Floyd’s death often seemed out of sync with ordinary Black residents.\n\n“I heard a lot of White activists purport to be speaking on behalf of communities of color. And I was listening to them — listening to communities of color — and they weren’t saying the same things,” Frey said. “I’d walk down the street and I’d hear from White people, ‘Defund the police! Defund the police!’ And then I’d hear from a Black person a half block later, ‘Hey, we really need to have some additional help.’”\n\nSheila Nezhad, a community organizer who turned out to be one of Frey’s most competitive mayoral opponents in November, noted that turnout was lower in north Minneapolis than the citywide average, and that the advocacy group — called Yes 4 Minneapolis — that proposed the ballot measure that came to be seen as the “defund” referendum was led by Black people.\n\n“And I’m not White,” she said. “So when Jacob Frey talks about only White people want to defund or whatever … I think that he is perhaps shaping the narrative to benefit his political goals.”\n\nEven before Floyd’s killing, the MPD had drawn criticism for its approach to policing the Black community.\n\nIn 2016, anti-police protests erupted after it was announced that two Minneapolis officers involved in the shooting death of Jamar Clark – a 24-year-old Black man who scuffled with the officers and, according to authorities, reached for one of their guns — would not be charged. Two years later, after responding to calls of a man shooting a gun in the air, police chased and fatally shot 31-year-old Thurman Blevins, who said “please don’t shoot me” as he ran away from them; body cameras showed officers yelling at him to drop his gun. Police say Blevins turned with his gun toward the officers, who ultimately were not charged.\n\nAnd then came May 25, 2020. In a nine-minute video that seemed to last an eternity, a police officer defiantly knelt on the neck of a handcuffed, face-down Floyd, whose pleas for help went unanswered until he fell silent. Now infamous, the officer, Derek Chauvin – who’d already had 18 prior complaints filed against him – was convicted of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison.\n\nA person holds a sign displaying a portrait of George Floyd during a vigil at an art installation honoring victims of police burtaliuty in Minneapolis in June 2020. (Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images) Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“For me, it was a moment of deep grief,” said Nezhad, who still wants to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department. “And the days that followed offered a glimpse into just how ready so many people are for massive change.”\n\nIn April, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights released a report, two years in the making, charging that the Minneapolis department’s officers have engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination when conducting traffic stops or using force. It called for ordering a consent decree, which is essentially a court-enforced settlement to reform the department. The report also blasted the MPD for “ineffective accountability,” saying that “almost every investigation of a police misconduct complaint against an MPD officer … is assessed or guided by sworn MPD officers.”\n\nThe city is in negotiations with the human rights department over the consent decree, and Frey has indicated that some of his budget priorities are in direct response to the report.\n\nDon Samuels — a former Minneapolis City Councilman who surprised political observers this summer by nearly defeating US Rep. Ilhan Omar, an icon of progressive politics in America — said the video of Floyd’s death was the most “evil thing I had ever seen.”\n\n“That was so painful — just painful to watch and to see a Black man, of dark complexion, under the knee of a dispassionate White male,” Samuels said. “It conjured up all kinds of slavery imagery.”\n\nAnd yet, Samuels, a 73-year-old immigrant from Jamaica — who lives in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of north Minneapolis — experienced another kind of dismay when he saw the nine council members on the Defund stage while watching the news on TV with his wife.\n\nDon Samuels, the moderate Democrat who nearly unseated US Rep. Ilhan Omar on August 9, photographed in his home in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\n“It was like a World Trade Center moment for us,” he told CNN. “Our jaws fell to the floor. Literally, we were aghast. We looked at each other and said, ‘Oh, my God. It’s going to be Crime City in Minneapolis.’”\n\nThat summer, Samuels joined the residents of north Minneapolis who sued the city for its police shortage. Half of the plaintiffs are Black.\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, Samuels ran a kind of middle-ground campaign on public safety.\n\n“We don’t have to choose safety or police – we can have both/and,” Samuels said at a town hall campaign event in August. “Let’s get rid of the bad police, let’s fix the fixable police.”\n\nHe lost, but the “both/and” approach appears to be the current path that the city of Minneapolis is on.\n\n‘Both-and’: A post-Defund approach\n\nOn a morning this August, in a scene that offered a sharp contrast from two years ago — when Mayor Frey made his “lonely walk” through an angry crowd — he and Commissioner Alexander, both smartly dressed, strode triumphantly through corridors of City Hall.\n\nAlexander, a 67-year-old former deputy sheriff with a doctorate in psychology who was hand-picked by Frey, had just been confirmed as the city’s community safety commissioner in a contentious council meeting. His newly created position amounts to the first piece of Frey’s proposed plan to combine 911, police, fire, neighborhood safety and emergency management under one roof.\n\nCedric Alexander speaks about policing in America during CivicCon at the Rex Theatre in downtown Pensacola, Florida, in September 2021. (Gregg Pachkowski/News-Journal/USA Today Network) Gregg Pachkowski/USA Today Network\n\n“The number one, first priority is the fact that people in this community don’t feel that they’re safe,” said Alexander — who served on the 21st Century Task Force on Policing under former President Barack Obama — during an impromptu press conference minutes after his hiring. “The fact is that we have violent crime that’s occurring, and occurring way too frequently.”\n\nAlexander, who retired in 2017 as the public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, in the metro Atlanta area, added that the MPD isn’t likely to become fully staffed overnight — “probably not even in our careers” — and stressed the importance of data-driven policing and building relationships.\n\n“If we don’t build relationships with these people in our communities, you ain’t solving crime nowhere,” said Alexander, a former CNN contributor on law enforcement issues.\n\nOsler, the St. Thomas professor, said at the moment, people don’t want to work for the MPD, “where officers are not respected. And to be straight-up about it, MPD earned that lack of respect.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the department needs to focus on two key metrics: improving homicide clearance rates and executing search warrants for violent criminals, which, Osler acknowledged, is no easy feat.\n\n“Think about it from the perspective of the person executing that warrant,” Osler said. “You’re going to bust down the door and who you know is on the other side is someone who’s probably already shot somebody. That’s a tough job. No wonder people don’t want to do it.”\n\nExterior of the police department's 3rd Precinct in south Minneapolis that was burned by rioters in May of 2020. To this day it remains boarded up. Its officers are currently headquartered a few miles away downtown. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nOn the policy front, the wheels of change seem to be grinding forward, however slowly.\n\nSince Gov. Tim Walz signed a police accountability law two years ago that banned chokeholds and “warrior” style police training, the city of Minneapolis appears to be finding a path forward that avoids having to choose between building the police force and reimagining public safety. The city is not only looking at further beefing up the police budget but is also piloting a slate of programs that send unarmed responders to nonviolent 911 calls. Mayor Frey has proposed making them permanent in his recommended budget for 2023-2024.\n\nFrey argues that the centerpiece of his proposed public safety plan – creating a new Office of Community Safety — captures much of what the “defund” movement was after in the first place.\n\nThe concept is to “match the best possible people with what is actually being experienced on the street,” Frey said. “Anybody who was for that before but is not for it now is pretty disingenuous.”\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, the MPD is trying to entice young blood with incentives — for instance by covering the cost of tuition for potential recruits who need law-enforcement coursework but only have a high school degree. It’s a big challenge — not just because so many officers have left, but also because there is a shortage of young people across the country getting into law enforcement, Alexander said.\n\nThe city has made headway when it comes to filling the top job: Frey recently announced three finalists — all of them from outside Minneapolis — for the permanent chief position, which Huffman has filled on an interim basis since December.\n\nLast summer, the police presence in the city was so thin — and the rate of violence so high — that a group of volunteers in the faith community went to heroic measures to break the cycle.\n\nThe idea was simple. In an initiative called 21 Days of Peace, church volunteers simply hung out in some of the most deadly neighborhoods to engage in violence prevention.\n\nThe effort was considered a success, but for one volunteer it came at a cost.\n\nGloria Howard, a grandmother, had just handed out snow cones to two women with young children at one of the violence hotspots near a liquor store on Broadway Avenue when a barrage of gunfire sent people scattering.\n\nHoward crumpled to the ground. When she tried to get up, she couldn’t — she’d been shot twice.\n\nGloria Howard, a survivor of gun violence, poses for a portrait a few yards away from where she was struck by bullets in north Minneapolis. She was serving snow cones as a volunteer for 21 Days of Peace when it happened. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nPeople from a nearby church rushed out of the building to render aid and call the police.\n\n“When I got to the hospital, the doctors were like, ‘Well, you’re some lucky lady and you must be somebody special because you have no metal fragments in your body,’” Howard said. The bullets, she said, “went through and through.”\n\nHoward, who was against the “defund” initiative, said there are specific reforms she would like to see, starting with a push to require more officers to live in the city they serve.\n\n(A 2017 Star Tribune report found that just 8% of MPD officers lived in Minneapolis. Chauvin lived in the suburb of Oakdale, where nearly 72% of the residents are White.)\n\n“All Black men are not big and scary,” Howard said. “All Black women are not angry. So, you know, you have to be able to know the community.”\n\nBut she realizes that even with such reforms, improvement would take time.\n\n“I don’t even walk Broadway anymore,” Howard said, while eying the thoroughfare from a distance, close to where she was shot. “I’ve seen the cars speeding up and down when they’re chasing each other. And then when they start shooting, it can come from anywhere. So I don’t even do that anymore. And I never used to be afraid coming over here.”", "authors": ["Rob Kuznia.

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/health/ivf-women-jennifer-aniston-wellness-cec/index.html", "title": "Their IVF journeys did not end with children. Here's what they want ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Jennifer Aniston opened up recently about her struggle with IVF treatments while trying to start a family, she gave a voice to people who’ve undergone arduous infertility journeys that ended with no biological children.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, is a method of assisted reproduction that involves removing eggs from the ovaries and fertilizing them outside the body. The resulting embryos are then typically placed in a woman’s uterus in the hopes that they spur a pregnancy.\n\nThe procedure is not cheap. Each cycle can cost between $12,000 and $17,000 out of pocket, according to one estimate, although in some places it’s covered by insurance.\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston opened up recently about her failed attempts to get pregnant and said she has \"zero regrets.\" David Livingston/Getty Images\n\nCNN talked to four women who’ve tried IVF unsuccessfully. They described months of daily shots, ultrasounds and labwork. Of long waits, hope and disappointment. Of financial strains and painful questions from loved ones and strangers alike on why they don’t have children.\n\n“The current infertility narrative is dominated by success stories, as people seem more willing to talk about their experience after they’ve become a parent,” says Katy Seppi, 40. “For those of us who close our infertility chapters without a baby, we’re often met with unsolicited advice, reinforcing the narrative that we obviously gave up too early.”\n\nAniston’s story helped put a face to people who are involuntarily childless – a deeply personal struggle many say they quietly face in the shadows.\n\nHere are their stories.\n\nShe plunged into grief after giving up trying to have a child\n\nSeppi struggled with infertility for four years. In April 2017, she turned to IVF.\n\nShe picked baby names and a birthing center. She had a room ready for a nursery at her home in Salt Lake City. But after one cycle of IVF, her embryos were not viable.\n\nThe process worsened her fibroids – noncancerous growths in the uterus – and her endometriosis, a condition in which the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. Seppi decided not to pursue a second cycle after her reproductive endocrinologist warned it would likely lead to a similar outcome as the first one, she says.\n\nFor Seppi, the detailed ovulation calendars, obsessive attempts to conceive and the despair that came with negative pregnancy tests became unbearable. After weighing all her reproductive health concerns, she decided to end her motherhood journey and get a hysterectomy in 2017, a decision that initially plunged her into a grief that she described as all-encompassing.\n\n\"I stopped to protect my physical, emotional and mental health,\" says Katy Seppi, 40, of her decision to end her infertility journey. Courtesy Katy Seppi\n\n“I am one of the lucky few who had IVF coverage through my employer, so it didn’t come as a financial sacrifice for me,” she says. “But I stopped to protect my physical, emotional and mental health. My heart would shatter every month when I’d get my period, and I didn’t know how much more I could take.”\n\nShe started seeing a therapist who told her it’s OK to put herself first and helped her process what not having a baby meant for her future.\n\n“I’d spent my whole life dreaming about motherhood. … I stayed at my job so I’d have maternity leave – I had held space in my life for a baby,” she says. “Through therapy, grief work, and connecting with others in the childless community, I slowly started to create a new vision for my life. I chose myself and my wellbeing over holding onto the hope of a baby.”\n\nDuring her infertility journey, Seppi says couldn’t find many resources for people who are involuntarily childless. She poured her energy into trying to change that. She started a blog and an Instagram account devoted to childless people, and slowly began to connect with them.\n\nShe also founded Chasing Creation, an online community of people facing similar challenges that now hosts an annual online summit.\n\nSeppi says she believes Aniston’s openness about her own IVF journey helps validate the experiences of many people who are involuntarily childless.\n\n“There’s a common belief that anyone can have a baby if they want it enough, hope enough, and never give up,” she says. “It just isn’t true, and leads to a lot of misunderstanding and dismissal of the grief you’re left with when you realize you have to let go of your dream of parenthood.”\n\nThe many decisions surrounding the IVF process took a toll on her\n\nWhen Sherrae Lachhu decided to undergo IVF, she bought a pregnancy journal, maternity clothes and egg retrieval T-shirts for her and her husband.\n\nThe T-shirts were emblazoned with the words: “Legs up, lights out, time to get my eggs out.”\n\nLachhu, who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, had a good feeling about it. She bought about a dozen white and gray onesies, and a couple of additional pink ones, hoping for a baby girl.\n\nBut her two rounds of IVF were unsuccessful. The first one led to a positive pregnancy test in February, and bleeding and a miscarriage about six weeks later. The second transfer was conducted last month, around the time the first baby would have been due, and was not successful.\n\nIt takes immense strength to pursue a lifelong dream that comes with repeated disappointments, Lachhu says.\n\n\"For someone like myself with ADHD, the decision fatigue was at times overwhelming,\" Sherrae Lachhu, 45, says about the IVF process. Courtesy Sherrae Lachhu\n\nEvery stage of her journey involved numerous decisions, including whether to test an embryo and how many to get implanted, she says.\n\n“The toughest part has been the decision-making process. There are many decisions you have to make, starting with the decision to even embark on this journey when you’re at an advanced age, as I am,” says Lachhu, 45, an entrepreneur who owns a virtual practice for coaching and therapy.\n\n“Then decisions around the medical provider, which protocol sounds like it might work best for you, the loads of supplements the IVF community encourages you to take, the decision to continue to eat and drink as you normally would or go clean for months or years on end. For someone like myself with ADHD, the decision fatigue was at times overwhelming.”\n\nLachhu has three stepchildren through marriage but says she has moments of sadness in which she thinks about what she’s lost. She says she and her husband hope to keep trying to have a child, but their financial options are limited. Her husband’s job pays for two rounds of IVF, but they’ve exhausted those opportunities.\n\nFor them to try again, she says, her husband would have to get another job that provides the benefits all over again. Or they’d have to raise their own funds.\n\nLachhu says people sometimes ask her whether she chose not to have her own kids.\n\n“It likely doesn’t dawn on most of them that infertility is much more common than they realize, and every woman doesn’t just get pregnant and experience a live birth because she desires children.”\n\nHer embryos didn’t survive, but she still owed $17,000\n\nMeaghan Hamm, 35, went through the egg retrieval and fertilization process in August.\n\nDoctors collected seven mature eggs, and after fertilization, she ended up with five embryos. But none of them survived.\n\nIt was an emotional and financial blow for Hamm, a customer support agent at a bank in Ontario, Canada. She’d paid for the process by skipping vacations with her husband and getting money from her family.\n\n“The toughest part was feeling like we are getting somewhere to have five embryos and end up with none with no actual chance to do a transfer,” she says. “It was a rough blow financially since we still had to pay for everything.”\n\n\"Many people are uneducated on infertility issues and have this belief that IVF will fix it,\" says Meaghan Hamm, 35. Courtesy Meaghan Hamm\n\nThe egg retrieval cost almost $12,000 and the medication about $5,000, she says. Testing on the embryos would have been an additional $5,000, but the couple didn’t have to pay for that since they did not get to that stage.\n\nIn Ontario, the provincial government pays for one cycle of egg retrieval, but there’s a wait list of nearly two years, she says. She says she and her husband paid out of pocket, but their names remain on the wait list.\n\nHamm says that stories of unsuccessful IVF procedures are not told enough and as a result, most people don’t understand what the process entails and how difficult it can be. Aniston’s story sheds light on these struggles and may help reduce the stigma for people who feel they are judged for not having children, Hamm says.\n\n“Many people are uneducated on infertility issues and have this belief that IVF will fix it,” she says. “The concept of IVF fixing infertility needs to end. People sharing their unsuccessful IVF stories will help others see that it isn’t their fault. It can help others not feel so alone.”\n\nShe felt like a failure when her IVF didn’t work\n\nApril Barsby, 32, had one cycle of IVF in September of last year. Her lone mature egg was graded a C, she says, but it was the only one she had and she hoped it would help fulfill her dream of motherhood.\n\nBarsby, who lives in Norman, Oklahoma, struggled with endometriosis and low egg count, so she’d pinned her dreams on one egg.\n\n“The hardest part about it was all of my hopes being crushed at the very end, as my sweet little egg didn’t stick and my cycle failed,” she says. “I only had one mature egg after my retrieval and put all my hope and excitement into it.”\n\n\"I had a very hard time for months to even feel remotely like a woman due to my body's failure,\" says April Barsby, 32. Courtesy April Barsby\n\nBarsby does not have a job. Her friends and family donated items she then sold at yard sales to help fund the procedure.\n\nThe process drained her and her husband’s finances and left her struggling to accept her body. The couple put their IVF journey on pause for now and Barsby says she’s not sure what to do next.\n\n“My husband is my biggest supporter and it hasn’t affected our marriage in any way,” she says. “I had a very hard time for months to even feel remotely like a woman due to my body’s failure.”\n\nBarsby says she grew up watching Aniston on “Friends” and was reassured to realize the wealthy celebrity with the girl-next-door persona went through similar struggles.

Greg Abbott’s attempt to explain away gun deaths at the elementary school in his state this week by comparing them to gun violence in Chicago.\n\n“I hate to say this, but there are more people who were shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas,” Abbott said on Wednesday, arguing stricter gun laws are not a solution.\n\nThere are indeed a horrific number of gun deaths in Chicago each year. CNN has covered the problem.\n\nBut there are more gun deaths in Texas, by far, than in any other state, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTexas suffered 4,164 gun deaths in 2020, the most recent year for which the CDC has published data.\n\nThat’s a rate of 14.2 deaths per 100,000 Texans.\n\nCalifornia, by comparison, saw 3,449 deaths, a gun death rate of 8.5.\n\nTexas does not have the highest gun death rate, however. Far from it.\n\nThe top states by gun death rates are:\n\nMississippi – 28.6.\n\nLouisiana – 26.3.\n\nWyoming – 25.9.\n\nMissouri – 23.9.\n\nAlabama – 23.6.\n\nAlaska – 23.5.\n\nHere’s where the lack of good federal data haunts us. It’s hard to find solid gun ownership rates. The RAND Corporation, a non-profit research organization, has tried and published data on average gun ownership by state between 2007 and 2016.\n\nAll of those states with the highest gun death rates are among the ones with the highest gun ownership rates.\n\nMississippi – 50% of adults live in a household with a gun.\n\nLouisiana – 48%.\n\nWyoming – 59%.\n\nMissouri – 48%.\n\nAlabama – 50%.\n\nAlaska – 59%.\n\nWhere there are fewer guns, there are fewer gun deaths. The states with the lowest gun death rates in 2020, per the CDC (alongside the percentage of homes with a gun in 2007-2016, per RAND) were:\n\nHawaii – 3.4 (8% of adults live in a household with a gun).\n\nMassachusetts – 3.7 (10%).\n\nNew Jersey – 5 (8%).\n\nRhode Island – 5.1 (11%).\n\nNew York – 5.3 (14%).\n\nThe advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, which endorses stronger gun laws, takes the CDC data on gun deaths per 100,000 residents and puts that alongside each state’s gun laws. The states with lower gun violence rates are mostly among the states with the strongest gun laws.\n\nConversely, with the exception of Louisiana, the states with the highest gun death rates and highest gun ownership rates are among the states Everytown says have the most lax gun laws.\n\nMost gun deaths are suicides\n\nObviously mass shootings can happen anywhere, as we saw earlier this month in Buffalo, New York, and this week in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nBut most gun deaths do not involve a mass shooting. Most gun deaths are suicides. In 2020, 54% of gun deaths in the US were suicides, which are far less likely to get sustained public attention, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of CDC data.\n\nCNN wrote in 2019 about the rising suicide rate and a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open that found higher suicide rates in rural areas – and, in cities, if there was a gun shop in the neighborhood.\n\nCities often have higher gun violence rates than states\n\nChicago does have a horrifically high murder rate, although the guns there often come from a neighboring state.\n\nThere are higher murder rates in other cities, and they’re often in places with more lax gun laws, like Jackson, Mississippi. Read this CNN dispatch about murders in Jackson. It is heartbreaking.\n\nAccording to Everytown’s analysis of FBI data, the cities with the highest gun homicide rates in 2020 were all in states with lax gun laws:\n\nJackson, Mississippi – 69 gun homicides per 100,000 people.\n\nGary, Indiana – 64.\n\nSt. Louis – 50.\n\nNew Orleans – 48.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee – 47.\n\nBaltimore, where the gun laws are relatively strict, was next.\n\nMurder rates rising\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has led to a rise in gun violence, and in January, a CNN analysis found 10 of the nation’s most populous cities set homicide records last year, mostly because of guns. The cities were: Philadelphia; Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Portland, Oregon; Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Milwaukee; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Tucson, Arizona.\n\nIn the large cities hardest hit by gun violence, there are areas that are relatively untouched compared with areas that are under attack, as researchers from the Brookings Institution found in a report published last month.\n\nIn Chicago, they said, gun homicides in 2019 and 2020 were concentrated in neighborhoods far from the city center “that have long suffered from severe disinvestment as a result of white flight, and are now centers of concentrated poverty with predominantly Black residents.”\n\nIn other words, it’s generations of neglect and division that help drive the murder rate in cities. All these deaths – rural suicide, urban murder and mass shootings everywhere – have one thing in common: guns.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Despite a lockout and delay in Opening Day, the players are actually going to take the field. When my father, born in 1927, was my age, Opening Day was one of the biggest events on the sports calendar.\n\nFor his son, it’s just another day. It’s not that I don’t like baseball – I do. It’s that baseball is not the sport that stands out above all others in my mind.\n\nMy family’s story is part of a larger one about America’s declining interest in baseball and generational replacement.\n\nThe sport, which was once the most popular in the country, has a bevy of problems that has landed it, at best, a distant second place in America’s hearts. This is especially true among America’s youth.\n\nJust 11% of adults listed baseball as their favorite sport to watch in a 2021 Washington Post poll. That put it well behind football (34%) and tied with basketball for the second favorite sport. Soccer and “something else” (e.g. esports/competitive video gaming) were closely behind at 7%.\n\nWhen examining the poll more in-depth, the problem baseball has becomes both more apparent – and even scarier. A mere 7% of those under the age of 30 say baseball is their favorite sport. This ranked fifth behind football (24%), basketball (17%), “something else” (12%) and soccer (10%).\n\nWhile these fans are overjoyed to be at the ballpark, only 11% of total adults and 7% of people aged under 30 in the US list baseball as their favorite sport. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nTo put baseball’s overall 11% in perspective, there were many more fans of baseball the last time there was a work stoppage in 1994. In an average of Gallup polls that year, 19% of Americans said baseball was their favorite sport.\n\nWhile the 1994 baseball strike may have hurt the sport’s popularity, the truth is baseball had been on the decline for a while. Baseball hadn’t ranked as America’s favorite sport to watch since 1960, when 34% said it was. Soccer that year came in at less than 0.5%, while football picked up 21% support. By the next poll Gallup did on the subject in 1972, baseball was second to football.\n\nThe rise of TV\n\nThe fact that 1960 is the last time baseball reigned supreme is notable. The sports landscape has changed dramatically from 62 years ago.\n\nOne big reason baseball no longer finds itself the darling of American sports is competition and the dawn of the television age.\n\nThe NFL didn’t sign its first league-wide TV contract until 1962; it led to every game being on television and each team receiving a share of the revenue pie. This came around the same time that the AFL – a rival league which would eventually merge with the NFL – started play and signed its own league-wide TV deal.\n\nAfter this point, this meant that over 20 teams had their contests televised, and the country had universal access to the pro game. Additionally, the Super Bowl would begin in 1967. The NFL, of course, is a sport that benefits tremendously from being seen. Baseball, on the other hand, doesn’t gain as much going from radio to television.\n\nAn NBC camera at Yankee Stadium circa 1950 in the Bronx, New York City. MLB/Getty Images\n\nAnother sport which is better visually than audibly is basketball. The NBA was less than 15 years old in 1960. There were just eight NBA teams at that point – half the size of either professional baseball or football. The NBA Finals wouldn’t be aired in their entirety nationally until 1970.\n\nThe country was years away from a successful professional soccer league in 1960 – let alone the incarnation of the MLS. Now, a soccer fan can watch games from here and those across the Atlantic Ocean – the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, for example – with ease.\n\nAs for other sports, there were only six NHL teams compared to the 32 today. And the idea of competitive video gaming was a science fiction fantasy and not at all conceivable.\n\nThe increased competition and the use of screens to watch sports came at an inopportune time for baseball.\n\nIf bored, Americans can change the channel very quickly. On social media platforms like TikTok, things go by faster than a bullet train. Baseball is anything but fast as far as Americans are concerned.\n\nCheck out this 2007 Gallup poll when people who weren’t pro baseball fans were asked why they didn’t like the sport. The two top reasons given were boring/uninteresting (31%) and games being too slow/too long (21%).\n\nBaseball boredom?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves' Truist Park during the national anthem prior to Game Four of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros. Michael Zarrilli/Getty Images\n\nWhen you look at the data from actual games, you get why people might think the sport is either too boring or too slow.\n\nBalls being put into play have shrunk dramatically, and the strikeout rate has skyrocketed. About 100 years ago, there were well more than twice as many hits than strikeouts in baseball. In 1960, there were 1.7 times as many hits than strikeouts. Last year, there were nearly 3,000 more strikeouts than hits.\n\nIn most sports besides baseball or football, the game is constantly in action. Unlike in baseball, there’s a real rhythm to when each football play starts up with a moving game and play clock.\n\nIncreasingly too, baseball fans need to sit through a game which is taking longer and longer to finish. The length of the average a nine-inning game has gone from two hours and 33 minutes in 1960 to three hours and 10 minutes in 2021. Compare this with a soccer match, which has 90 minutes of play, a 15-minute halftime and some stoppage time – usually two to four minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there simply isn’t a sport that requires someone to sit through more minutes with so little action – so often. While NFL game lengths are similar, remember that an MLB team has 162 regular season games per year. The NFL has just 17.\n\nPerhaps, people might be more willing to sit through long games if they cared about the players. Many people have pointed out the fact that baseball doesn’t have any “stars” as a reason why the sport has struggled.\n\nIn an era in which fans are increasingly rooting for players over teams, this could be a big problem.\n\nOne way we can look at this is through the number of Instagram followers the top athletes in baseball, basketball and football have.\n\nArguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years, Mike Trout still lags far behind his sport competitors on social media. Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n\nMike Trout – arguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years alone – has only about two million followers. This trails NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. and his more than 15 million followers. It’s well behind NBA great LeBron James, who has over 100 million followers. International soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has over 420 million followers, though many of those are outside the United States.\n\nThe inability to be big on social media is just one reason that baseball is likely struggling with today’s youth.\n\nBeyond social media, there was a time when the greatest baseball stars were household names. Consider a 1945 poll from Gallup asking Americans whether they knew who different stars across various industries were.\n\nMore than 90% said they knew who former baseball star Babe Ruth was. The vast majority – 90% of all Americans – not only knew who he was but were able to give a description of what he was famous for. Keep in mind, this poll was taken 10 years after Ruth last suited up to play professional baseball.\n\nRuth was better known at the time than World War II General George Patton. The same percentage of Americans knew who Ruth was as they did future president and five-star General Dwight Eisenhower, who had just helped lead the Americans to victory in Europe.\n\nModern polling indicates that there isn’t any modern baseball player who is anywhere near the level of recognition of Ruth. In fact, some data indicates that less than half of Americans even know who Trout is.\n\nThe lack of star power just isn’t the case in basketball or football. You have stars like James and the recently retired Tom Brady, who have Ruth-level name identification among the American public. Both sports, not surprisingly, have many more athletes known by at least 50% of the public than baseball.\n\nIs there anything baseball can do to reverse the tide? I don’t know.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask at this point is whether baseball is merely trading on its legacy. As the Greatest Generation – i.e. my father’s – fades into the memory books, it seems quite plausible that baseball’s spot in the top 2 or 3 favorite sports in America may fade along with it.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/opinions/maus-ban-holocaust-teaching-spiegelman-perry/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The real reason some people are so afraid of 'Maus' | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: David M.

Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nI thought it was a comic book. I first saw this book called “Maus” on the shelf in the guest room of our Nashville house. I don’t remember why I was looking at the books. Maybe I was just a bored 17-year-old looking for something to do. I just remember being confused, because as far as I knew my parents didn’t own any comic books. And why did it have a swastika on the cover? But I picked it up, sat down on the couch and started to read.\n\nDavid Perry\n\nAs I flipped the pages, I felt myself becoming a little disoriented, unclear why this book was telling the story of the Holocaust in this way, with drawings of Jews as mice and Nazis as cats. But I was quickly drawn in, flipping pages faster and faster, then pausing, going back and trying to process the visual narrative of Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel instead of just skimming words. In the end, I felt unsettled, unsure of what I just encountered, but sensing it mattered deeply.\n\nBack then, as a bookish Jewish teenager, I was pretty sure I knew a lot about the history of the Holocaust. My parents were historians. I was, it turned out, pretty good in history class. I had read “Man’s Search for Meaning” by the survivor Victor Frankl in eighth grade.\n\nBut “Maus” was different – I was pulled in by the choices made possible by the medium itself. It was hand-drawn, the mice at once distinct as characters (the author, his mother, his father and their community) but at the same time rendered into a mob of animals fit only for slaughter by the Nazi cats. The triangular shape of the mice’s heads evoked long-held stereotypes about the shapes of our faces as seen by our oppressors, while also conveying warmth and even humanity.\n\nSandra Stevenson/CNN\n\nI can’t tell you why it worked, but it did – and reading it changed me. Clearly, I’m not alone in finding the book a perspective-altering experience. It’s the only graphic novel to win the Pulitzer Prize, and it’s become part of school curricula all around the country.\n\nBut not everywhere. Earlier this week, back in my home state of Tennessee, the McMinn County Board of Education voted 10-0 to remove the book from the curriculum. They cited a few instances of profanity and a “naked picture” – this is a small image of the artist’s mother in the bathtub after taking pills and slashing her wrists, with her breasts visible – as in violation of standards and thus unteachable. On CNN, Spiegelman said, “You have to really, like, want to get your sexual kicks by projecting on it. I think they’re so myopic in their focus and they’re so afraid of what’s implied and having to defend the decision to teach ‘Maus’ as part of the curriculum that it lead to this kind of daffily myopic response.”\n\nBut even though one board member, according to meeting minutes originally reported by TN Holler, was quick to assert he wasn’t “against teaching the Holocaust,” they apparently couldn’t allow it to be taught in a way that included profanity and nudity – in other words, in a way that conveys its dehumanizing reality. The same board member said, “[Maus] shows people hanging, it shows them killing kids, why does the educational system promote this kind of stuff, it is not wise or healthy.”\n\nBut this betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of what education is. To ban “Maus” for being an uncomfortable read is, in fact, to be against teaching the Holocaust, regardless of the school board member’s protests to the contrary. To actually engage with the horror of the Holocaust, one has to be horrified, thrown from one’s comfortable position, engaging with the terrible, messy reality.\n\nBut I think back to my encounter with the book on my couch, and I think that’s the kind of moment that kids actually do need. We need to be unsettled by history, especially if presented by a well-trained teacher with a thoughtful supporting curriculum. Because the Holocaust is not just a collection of unthinkable numbers – six million Jews, hundreds of thousands of Roma and tens of thousands more of political rivals, disabled people, LGBTQ people and others. It’s millions of stories of individual lives lived in full complexity, and to understand what happened, the whys and hows, the generational traumas that live with us today, we may need to be unsettled in our encounter with this grim past.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd of course that’s true if we want to understand other grim moments in history as well. And while the timing of canceling “Maus” a few days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day is telling, it’s also happening in the midst of a growing number of right-wing attacks on teaching history. Before this latest incident, for example, a White Tennessee mom tried to take advantage of a new law against “critical race theory,” which is being used as a catchall phrase for any history that tells accurate stories of racial oppression, to try to get an autobiography of Ruby Bridges banned as “divisive.” And then, earlier in January, Florida Republicans advanced a bill designed to shield students from feeling “discomfort” over race, sex and gender when learning about history (of racism, sexism and gender discrimination). The effect will be, as likely intended, to make it impossible to teach history effectively.\n\nAnd that’s likely the point. When we are unsettled by history, when our perceptions start to shift, that’s when we’re ready to learn. To outlaw discomfort in the classroom is to outlaw good teaching.", "authors": ["David M.

It comes more than two weeks after a racist assault at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a bloody attack at a church in California; and eight days after a heartbreaking massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nThe Tulsa shooting is one of the 233 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

He then called Phillips’ office several times over several days, complaining of pain and wanting additional treatment, according to Franklin.\n\nLouis saw Phillips on Tuesday for treatment, and called Phillips’ office again on Wednesday before the shooting, “complaining of back pain and wanting additional assistance,” Franklin said.\n\nLouis bought an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle from a gun store at 2 p.m. Wednesday, Franklin said. Louis also had bought a .40-caliber pistol from a pawn shop on Sunday, Franklin said.\n\nThe two firearms were found at the scene, Tulsa police Capt. Richard Meulenberg told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nPolice were initially alerted about the shooting in a 911 at 4:53 p.m. Wednesday. The call was made by someone off campus who’d been on a video chat with a doctor who was at the building, Franklin said.\n\n“The doctor told her to call 911, saying there has been a shooting,” Franklin said.\n\nResponding officers arrived at 4:56 p.m., Franklin said. Two minutes later, officers who’d reached the second floor heard a gunshot, the chief said.\n\n“We believe that was the final gunshot, with the suspect taking his own life,” Franklin said.\n\nAt least one slain person was found in the same room as the gunman, as well as an uninjured female who was “hiding under a desk at the suspect’s foot,” Franklin said.\n\nAdministrator: Dr. Phillips was ‘the consummate gentleman’\n\nPhillips was an orthopedic surgeon at the clinic, with an interest in spinal surgery and joint reconstruction, the hospital system said.\n\nThe notion that anyone would go after Phillips is “mind blowing,” said Dr. Cliff Robertson, president and CEO of Saint Francis Health System.\n\n“Dr. Philips was the consummate gentleman,” Robertson said at Thursday’s news conference in Tulsa’s Heart Hospital at Saint Francis.\n\n“He’s one of those folks that … his clinic cannot always be on time because he will spend every minute with patients that they need,” Robertson said. “It is the ultimate loss for Saint Francis and for Tulsa.”\n\nDr. Preston Phillips, right, shakes hands with Dr. Komi Folly during a medical mission in Togo in 2019.

Partial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight to behold.\n\nTotal eclipses can lead to a period of darkness lasting for several minutes, during which time nocturnal animals stir while confused birds and insects may fall silent, NASA says.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse reaches totality, people are able to see the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface. This offers scientists an uncommon opportunity to study the corona.\n\nTotality also offers spectators a chance to gaze upon the spectacular sight with the naked eye, though proper safety glasses are still required for the rest of the time.\n\nWhat states are on the 2024 eclipse path of totality?\n\nMexico's pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. The path will cut diagonally across the country, traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nIn the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nSee interactive maps of the 2024 path.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Ramon Padilla & Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/09/why-is-the-april-2024-total-eclipse-a-big-deal/72853143007/", "title": "Why is the solar eclipse such a big deal? What makes April 8 so rare", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe sky is filled with breathtaking wonders, but one occurring on April 8 is causing people to plan trips in droves, prompting fears of snarled highways and generating headline after headline.\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event — where the shadow of the moon will plunge a narrow strip of land into darkness in the middle of the day — is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\n\"The eclipse in 2024 could be even more exciting due to differences in the path, timing, and scientific research,\" reads a post from NASA. And like past similar natural phenomena, the eclipse is expected to elicit a strong emotional reaction from the people who see it, including from those who identify with its cultural significance.\n\nTotal solar eclipses over the US are rare: The next one won't happen for 20 years\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nSolar eclipses are rare in part because they can only occur during a new moon and when \"the moon's orbit is tilted five degrees to Earth's orbit around the Sun,\" according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis eclipse will pass over millions of people and be a short drive for millions more\n\nNASA estimates 215 million adults in the U.S. saw the 2017 solar eclipse either in person or electronically and even more people will likely see April's eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse's path of totality will pass over cities like Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York. And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nSearches for short-term Airbnb rentals around those areas have surged. Transportation officials in areas along the path of totality are warning residents and travelers that the eclipse could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions on roads around places with the best view.\n\nClouds could ruin total eclipse:This map shows how likely that is by city.\n\nTotal solar eclipses are awe-inspiring experiences\n\nThis year's total solar eclipse is expected to cause emotional reactions.\n\nA study of the social effects after an eclipse shows people who viewed the 2017 eclipse in its path of totality experienced feeling like part of a collective more than those who were outside of that path.\n\nResearchers found \"that astronomical events may play a vital collective function by arousing awe and social tendencies that orient individuals toward their collectives.\" They used Twitter, now X, data from millions of users to come to their conclusion.\n\nMore:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nAfter a total solar eclipse in Australia last year, The Guardian reported on a range of emotions among people who experienced the natural phenomena. One woman was near tears.\n\nThe silence and darkness during the eclipse will also create uncertainty for animals.\n\nInterpretations of a total solar eclipse vary across cultures, experts say.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse:Will bring a surreal silence and confuse all sorts of animals\n\n\"Across the ages, cultures from around the world have interpreted eclipses in myriad ways,\" reads a post from the San Francisco based nonprofit organization The Exploratorium. \"Sometimes eclipses cause fear, awe, or a sense that the cosmic order has fallen out of balance.\"\n\n\"A recurring and pervasive embodiment of the eclipse was a dragon, or a demon, who devours the Sun,\" reads the post, for example. The ancient Chinese and Incas, for example, used different tactics to \"help the Sun fight off the dragon\" during an eclipse, according to the nonprofit organization.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauarui, Eric Lagatta, Elizabeth Weise, Cheryl McCloud; USA TODAY Network\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

Explore these interactive maps.\n\nTypes of eclipses\n\nIs that a bit confusing? Here's a breakdown of the types of eclipses, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is between the sun and Earth, completely obscuring the sun. During a total solar eclipse, viewers can see the sun's corona -- its outer atmosphere -- which is generally obscured by the sun's brightness.\n\nWhat is an annular solar eclipse?\n\nAn annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, but it's at or near its farthest point from Earth. Because the moon is so far away from Earth, it's smaller than the sun and doesn't completely cover the sun. When this happens, the moon appears as a dark circle in front of the sun, surrounded by a bright ring.\n\nWhat is a partial solar eclipse?\n\nA partial solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, but aren't perfectly lined up, giving the sun a crescent shape.\n\nWhat is a total lunar eclipse?\n\nIn a total lunar eclipse, the moon moves into the inner part of the Earth's shadow. Some of the light passing through Earth's atmosphere reaches the moon's surface, giving the moon an orange or reddish color. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon will appear.\n\nWhat is a partial lunar eclipse?\n\nIn a partial lunar eclipse, the sun, Earth and moon align imperfectly, which leads to the moon passing through only part of Earth's shadow. The shadow only partially obscures the moon.\n\nWhat is a prenumbral eclipse?\n\nYou're likely not to see this one. In a prenumbral eclipse, the moon travels through the faint part of the Earth's shadow, causing the moon to dim only very slightly.\n\nContact IndyStar newsroom development director Holly Hays at holly.hays@indystar.com.

Your guide to glasses, forecast ...", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nWe're less than two weeks away from the astronomical event of the decade: A total eclipse of the sun, which will grace the nation's skies from Texas to Maine on the afternoon of Monday, April 8.\n\nMillions of people are expected to travel to see the spectacle, which will also attract scientists from across the country to study its unique effects on the Earth and its atmosphere. (Meanwhile, brands such as Burger King, Pizza Hut, Applebee's and Sonic are getting in on the eclipse excitement too.)\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality could still use eclipse glasses to see the moon pass in front of the sun. It's an awesome and confusing sight on the ground and in the sky.\n\nIt should go without saying:Don't drive while wearing eclipse glasses\n\nOne task to do now is to get yourself a pair of special eclipse glasses (and luckily there's still time to score a free pair of eclipse glasses). They're important eyewear during an eclipse because they will block out the sun's harmful rays, which could damage your eyes when you're looking at the sun — even if it's partially blocked.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are still readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet as of Thursday, March 28. But be wary of counterfeit or fake glasses, experts warned.\n\nThe other big factor everyone's anxiously awaiting is the weather forecast, which most experts say is still a bit far away for a specific forecast. But more detailed, realistic forecasts will start to roll in over the next few days.\n\nOf particular interest will be the cloud forecast, as a deck of thick, low clouds would likely ruin the entire event. But if the clouds are higher up in the atmosphere, such as thin, wispy cirrus, they'd act to diffuse but not ruin the eclipse.\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nThere's plenty to know before the big day, which won't happen again for about two decades. Read on for answers for all your eclipse questions, including how to watch the eclipse, understand the eclipse and use eclipse glasses to stay safe.\n\nHow do I watch the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThere are a few ways of watching the eclipse:\n\nGet the full experience in person : If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun.\n\n: If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun. Watch from outside the path of totality : Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun.\n\n: Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun. Watch a livestream: Check back on April 8 for a video feed from the path of totality. It's not the same as being there in person, but hey, at least you won't have to sit in traffic.\n\nTotality explained:The real April 2024 total solar eclipse happens inside the path of totality\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse on April 8?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path.\n\nYou can search by zip code to find the exact time for your location.\n\nWhere will the April eclipse be visible?\n\nAll of the lower 48 U.S. states will see the moon at least clip the sun, but that sight is a trifle compared to being in the path of totality.\n\nBecause the narrow path includes or is near some of the nation's largest cities, expect millions of people to crowd into a band of land a little over 100 miles wide that spans from the Texas/Mexico border to the Maine/Canada border.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nWill clouds block the April 2024 eclipse?\n\nIt's too soon to say for sure, but history offers some clues.\n\nChances of cloudy skies are pretty high along much of the eclipse's northern path, and some areas such as Buffalo have about a 1-in-3 chance of clear skies in early April.\n\nSkies are usually more clear to the south. Right along the Texas/Mexico border, chances of a clear sky can be nearly 75%.\n\nHowever, early forecasts tell a different story — although forecaster caution it's too early for truly accurate forecasts.\n\nKeep in mind that clouds don't always ruin an eclipse. High, wispy clouds won't spoil the show in the same way that low thick clouds would. In that case, you wouldn't be able to see the moon pass in front of the sun, but you would still notice a sudden darkness in the path of totality.\n\nWhat dangers are associated with the eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse, as exciting and fun as it promises to be, comes with a growing number of safety warnings — both for what will happen in the sky and what will happen on the ground.\n\nIn addition to the dangers of looking at the eclipse without proper eyewear, we've heard warnings about potentially dangerous fake eclipse glasses, the possibility for increased car crashes around the time of the eclipse — and possible air travel headaches due to delayed or cancelled flights.\n\nWhere is the best place to watch the eclipse?\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the eclipse, Texas was considered the best state for eclipse viewing. Historically, there's a good chance the skies will be clear and its location along the southern path of the eclipse means totality will last a little longer. That could change as the forecast evolves.\n\nA few lucky travelers will also have a front-row seat with unobstructed views — from a plane.\n\nWill traffic be bad?\n\nMost likely, yes — especially after the eclipse ends. Millions of people will crowd into the narrow path of totality, then many will attempt to leave all at once as soon as the eclipse is over.\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse passed over the U.S. in 2017, reports say some traffic jams didn't fully clear for more than 12 hours. Even worse, a recent study reported that the 2017 eclipse \"was associated with increased risks of a fatal traffic crash\" – potentially as much as a 31% increase, the study said.\n\nAlso worth noting: The eclipse is expected to have impacts for air travel as well.\n\nCities across the eclipse's path of totality are also bracing for an influx of visitors who are already booking up hotels and short-term vacation rentals, officials have told USA TODAY. \"Hotels are almost sold out,\" said Shalissa Perry, the chief marketing officer for Downtown Dallas.\n\nWhy are schools closing for the eclipse?\n\nPrimarily out of a concern for students' safety, schools across the country have given students the day of the eclipse, April 8, as a day off, a half day or a chance for e-learning. In Tennessee, for example, officials also say it gives students a chance to experience the eclipse with their family and friends.\n\nWhat's it like to watch a solar eclipse from space?\n\nEver wondered what it is like see the solar eclipse from space? NASA scientist and veteran astronaut Terry Virts has witnessed the spectacle in space.\n\n\"When I was in space in 2015, we saw an eclipse over the North Atlantic,\" Virts told USA TODAY this week. \"It was an eclipse that very few humans saw I think, but it was a really unique experience to look down and just see this big black circle kind of moving across the planet.\"\n\n\"It was unlike anything I've ever seen,\" Virts adds. \"I joke I'm glad they told us there was an eclipse because it would have been unsettling to look down at Earth and see this black spot moving across. It was really cool.\"\n\nVirts, who is the face of Sonic's eclipse-themed Blackout Slush Float, said that though he's seen one eclipse from space and many from Earth, he is super excited about the upcoming one on April 8.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse? Definition explained.\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when three celestial spheres — the sun, moon and Earth — line up in a specific way in space.\n\nAccording to NASA, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. That alignment casts a moving shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the sun's light in some areas. This leads to a period of partial or full darkness on a narrow stretch of Earth.\n\nThe path is so narrow because of the huge distance and size of the sun — as well as the moon's distance from Earth. That focuses the moon's shadow on an area of land much smaller than the moon itself. The movement of the shadow across the land happens as the Earth's rotation interacts with the orbit of the moon.\n\nA total eclipse only happens occasionally because the moon doesn't orbit in the exact same plane as the sun and Earth do. In addition, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon.\n\nWhat's special about a total solar eclipse?\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\nTotal solar eclipses can have spiritual significance, too. Ancient cultures viewed as a sign of the gods' anger or impending departure. Some religions today are hosting eclipse viewings and services.\n\nHistorically, eclipses have left major marks on religious and spiritual civilizations. In Christianity, an eclipse has been associated with the darkness that accompanied Jesus' crucifixion and in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad's son Ibrahim.\n\nWhen was the last solar eclipse?\n\nThe USA's most recent total solar eclipse was on August 21, 2017, and stretched from Oregon to South Carolina.\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nWhat are eclipse glasses and why are they needed for the eclipse?\n\nGazing at the bright rays from the eclipse without protective eyewear can seriously damage your eye, so wearing a pair of protective glasses is important.\n\nThere's a technical standard for eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out most light and let you safely see the moon pass in front of the sun: It's called ISO 12312-2 after the International Organization of Standardization.\n\nWhile there's concerns that not all glasses marketed as eclipse glasses live up to that standard, experts say in the past, the shortcomings haven't been significant.\n\nBut as the 2024 eclipse approaches, the American Astronomical Society has warned that there are some counterfeit and fake eclipse glasses being sold from unverified vendors that would be unsafe to use during the eclipse. They recommend buying from a vetted vendor and testing the glasses before the eclipse.\n\nHow do I get solar eclipse glasses?\n\nYou should buy from a reputable source who can ship the glasses to you in time for April 8. A guide to last-minute eclipse glasses explains more.\n\nHeads up: The online marketplace is flooded with retailers selling solar eclipse glasses they claim have the NASA seal of approval. Consider that a red flag to look elsewhere.\n\nHow can you test eclipse glasses?\n\nNASA shared an easy method to check eclipse glasses at home.\n\nBuyers should put on their glasses and look at a bright light, like a flashlight. If the light is \"extremely dim,\" or doesn't appear at all, the glasses are safe, Susannah Darling, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in an instructional video. Viewers should be able to see the filament of the lightbulb, not the glow surrounding the bulb.\n\nCan you really go blind watching a solar eclipse?\n\nYou could severely damage your eyes. Directly staring at the sun before and after the total eclipse, or watching a partial eclipse outside the path of totality without proper eye protection, can result in permanent damage including blurred and altered vision.\n\nWhile rare, eye damage from watching a partial eclipse happens in part because a person's natural response to squint when looking at sunlight does not get triggered. In the lead-up to the April 8 solar eclipse, doctors and a rare set of eclipse watchers are warning about watching this planetary event without adequate eclipse glasses or with the naked eye.\n\nIt’s hard for experts to know or even estimate how many people experience eye damage from solar eclipses. Since looking at an eclipse does not cause complete blindness, people with permanent damage may not know they have it or report it to a doctor. The 2017 eclipse, which passed from Oregon to South Carolina, is thought to have caused about 100 cases, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nHow can I watch the eclipse without glasses?\n\nIf you don't have access to eclipse glasses do not use regular sunglasses — You need a more creative solution for safe viewing, like a pinhole projector.\n\nWelding glasses are not recommended for eclipse viewing.\n\nShould I take dogs or cats to see the eclipse? Is it safe for pets?\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets.\n\nExperts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and anxious people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” she said.\n\nAnother fun way to experience the eclipse: disco balls\n\nDon't just reach for the solar glasses; a disco ball might be a fun and safe way to enhance the total solar eclipse experience.\n\nInspired by a research paper from European scientists, the Round Rock Public Library in Round Rock, Texas, near Austin, used disco balls during the annular eclipse in October and recommends people do the same for the April 8 eclipse. Officials said the use of a disco ball creates a \"party-like atmosphere\" to make a solar eclipse event more fun.\n\nThe mirrored ball can be placed outside where it can catch the sunlight and reflect it on a shaded wall at least several feet away, or it can be inside near a window to cast reflections of the sun around the room. Youth Services Librarian Andrea Warkentin recommends people get disco balls that have smaller mirrors on them as they will create bigger and better images.\n\n\"It's a way to make it really memorable and fun for little kids who may not really understand what's going on in the sky,\" Warkentin said.\n\n-Fernanda Figueroa, Austin American-Statesman\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla, Karina Zaiets and Janet Loehrke", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/07/10/michigan-solar-eclipse/465435001/", "title": "You'll probably be dead before Michigan's next total solar eclipse", "text": "Sorry, Michiganders: If you want to see a total solar eclipse in your lifetime, you're going to have to travel out of state.\n\nAs you may know, a total solar eclipse - when the moon aligns directly between the Earth and the sun - will take place Aug. 21, the first such phenomenon to span from coast-to-coast in the United States in almost 100 years.\n\nThe path of totality - where observers will see the moon completely cover the sun - starts in Oregon and travels through the likes of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina, plus small segments of other states.\n\nMichigan, however, is not one of those states; you'll only see a partial eclipse here.

Here's what to know.", "text": "Eclipse lovers, your moment in the sun (or the dark) is just one year away.\n\nOn April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will cross North America, passing over Mexico, the United States and Canada, NASA said.\n\nIt will be the nation's biggest eclipse event since the Great American Eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017, when millions of Americans were able to enjoy the cosmic spectacle. Next year's eclipse is the last total solar eclipse that will be visible in the U.S. until 2044.\n\nStates in the path of the eclipse are Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets in the way of the sun, turning day to an eerie twilight.\n\nPeople viewing the eclipse from locations where the moon’s shadow completely covers the sun – known as the \"path of totality\" – will experience a total solar eclipse, NASA said. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun.\n\nOutside the path of totality nearly all of North America will get a partial solar eclipse, the American Astronomical Society said.\n\nPreparations are underway\n\nSome of the big cities in the path include Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Cleveland, Buffalo and Indianapolis, where preparations already have begun. Indianapolis, which is calling itself the \"eclipse capital of the Midwest,\" is anticipating an influx of more than 1 million visitors next April, according to the city's tourism bureau.\n\nThere will even be a viewing celebration at the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto race in May.\n\nCleveland's visitor's bureau also is getting in on eclipse fever, which calls the eclipse \"a life-changing experience.\"\n\n\"The stars are literally aligning over 'The Land' for a blackout you’ll never forget. On April 8, 2024, at 3:13 p.m., Cleveland will be in the path of totality for the solar eclipse.\n\n\"If you’ve never seen an eclipse, this is the only way to do it, as the moon will block out the sun for nearly four minutes – one of the longest durations of any major city in the path of totality.\"\n\n'Four-minute solar eclipse climax'\n\nSolar eclipse enthusiasts, such as John Robinette, a self-described \"eclipse chaser\" from Takoma Park, Maryland, are already looking forward to next year's event:\n\n“If you’ve never experienced a total solar eclipse, imagine the thrill and excitement of witnessing a shooting star,\" he said. \"Amazing, right? And how long does it last? Maybe half a second?\n\n\"Now, multiply that half-second feeling of a shooting star to that of a four-minute solar eclipse climax. I guarantee you’ll never forget it and you’ll do everything you can to experience it again.\"\n\nRobinette, who traveled with his family to South Carolina to watch the eclipse in 2017, is already planning on how to view the 2024 eclipse.\n\nGet your eclipse glasses ready\n\nNASA reminds skywatchers to practice safe viewing before and after the total eclipse: \"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the moon completely blocks the sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing.\"\n\nIn fact, it's never safe to view the sun with the naked eye. The sun’s surface is so bright that if you stare at any portion of it, no matter how small, it produces enough light to permanently damage your retina.\n\nLength of time doesn't matter either. Without proper eye protection, you can suffer “eclipse blindness” – a serious injury in which the eye’s retina is damaged by solar radiation – within seconds of staring at the sun, according to the American Optometric Association.\n\nSo a pair of approved solar eclipse glasses are a must.\n\nClouds could spoil the view\n\nPast weather data indicates that \"clouds are more likely to get in the way along northern portions of the eclipse's path, while southern areas tend to have a clearer sky at the time of year coinciding with the eclipse,\" FoxWeather reports.\n\n\"Cities such as Austin and San Antonio ... average only 30 to 40% cloud coverage on an early-April afternoon,\" FoxWeather said. \"Meanwhile, the sky is typically 60 to 70% filled with clouds at the same time in places like Cleveland and Buffalo.\"\n\nAnnular solar eclipse coming to the Southwest in October\n\nFolks in the Southwest will get their own peek at a solar eclipse later this year, though it won't be a total one. An annular eclipse of the sun will be visible in the southwestern U.S. on Oct. 14, NASA said.\n\nAn annular solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth while it is at its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. \"Because the moon is farther away from Earth, it appears smaller than the sun and does not completely cover the star.\"\n\nThis creates a “ring of fire” effect in the sky. The name “annular” comes from the Latin word for ring, “annulus,” according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nOn Oct. 14, the annular eclipse will begin in the United States, traveling from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast. Weather permitting, the annular eclipse will be visible in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas, as well as some parts of California, Idaho, Colorado, and Arizona, NASA said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/04/12/total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024-path-michigan-ohio/69998180007/", "title": "Total solar eclipse is April 8, 2024: Path south of Michigan in Ohio", "text": "The next total solar eclipse will come to North America on April 8, 2024, passing by just south of Michigan through Toledo, Ohio. With the path of totality coming so close by, parts of southeastern Michigan may see a slight impact of the eclipse, and the full experience awaits just a short drive south.\n\nHere's what you need to know before heading out to catch a glimpse of this solar eclipse next year.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nTotal solar eclipses involve the moon passing between the sun and the Earth, blocking the face of the sun. Thus, impacted areas experience brief darkness and cooling during the eclipse, as the moon blocks sunlight from reaching the Earth. This upcoming eclipse will feature a gradual dimming of the sky, as the moon blocks the center of the sun, leaving an outer ring of the solar disk visible.\n\nPath of totality\n\nExperts predict the eclipse path will begin in Mexico and enter the U.S. through Texas, heading north before exiting North America on the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. This will occur over a span of several hours, starting at about 11:07 a.m. PDT and ending around 5:16 NDT. The duration of totality will last for up to 4 minutes and 27 seconds, varying across locations on the path of totality.\n\nToledo viewing\n\nThe University of Toledo's Ritter Planetarium will host a public viewing event at the Glass Bowl football stadium, said planetarium Director Michael Cushing. In Toledo, experts expect to see a modest duration, with the eclipse lasting about 1 minute and 53 seconds in the city's downtown.\n\n\"It's a really wonderful experience and the hope is that we'll have various booths around from science centers... in the glass bowl that people can hang around and go see during the day,\" Cushing said.\n\nOrganizers are in the early stages of planning for the event, gathering vendors, and preparing parking and promotional advertising.\n\n\"The idea is that everyone will get to come together,\" he said.\n\nFor Michigan viewers\n\nWhile Michigan won't be in the direct path of totality, the bottom corner of southeast Michigan may fall under the edge of the path. This means the area could see some dimming of the sky as the moon's shadow covers the sun, slightly cooling the atmosphere. Residents looking to experience the entirety of the eclipse can travel south into Ohio, where the path of totality will cross through.\n\nMore:Detroit area will see 80% of solar eclipse during August astronomical event\n\nMore:You'll probably be dead before Michigan's next total solar eclipse\n\nFrequency\n\nWhile total solar eclipses typically occur every 18 months, they don't often repeat in the same location. Just 15 total solar eclipses have been recorded in the U.S. within the last 150 years. The most recent such eclipse occurred in 2017, passing through parts of metro Detroit. Prior to that, the last total solar eclipse occurred in 1979. Experts predict the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. will occur on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nSafety tips\n\nCushing recommends wearing eclipse glasses or using a pinhole camera to view the eclipse. Staring directly at the sun can cause damage to viewers' eyesight and should be avoided.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/02/29/total-solar-eclipse-is-april-8-and-the-next-one-isnt-until-2045/72757659007/", "title": "Total solar eclipse is April 8 and the next one isn't until 2045", "text": "Next month, Rick Kupfer will travel to Texas Hill Country for the first time. He’ll set up some lawn chairs about an hour northwest of Austin near a place where the Buchanan Dam holds back the Colorado River and where for more than four minutes on April 8 the afternoon sun will turn coal black.\n\nIt’s the second trip for the Boynton Beach resident into the shadow of a total solar eclipse after a 2017 experience near Casper, Wyoming where the daytime twinkle of stars and pearly corona behind Earth’s only natural satellite were on display for two and a half minutes.\n\n“It looks like there is a big hole in the sky, like a big black hole in the sky,” Kupfer said. “We are so lucky that this is happening in our lifetime. It’s so rare, it’s exhilarating.”\n\nBefore 2017, the last total solar eclipse to be seen by a portion of the United States was a cloud-plagued event in 1979. After April 8, the next cosmic super show in the continental 48 won’t be until 2045.\n\nReserving a spot to watch solar eclipse a tricky business, and expensive one\n\nIn Palm Beach County, which is more than 1,000 miles from the eastern edge of the April 8th path of totality, about 50% of the sun will be covered by the moon.\n\nThat’s why for so-called “shadow chasers,” plans to reach next month’s 115-mile-wide path of totality from the sandy beaches of Mazatlan through the valleys of Newfoundland have been months, even years, in the making.\n\nWhere were you?:Pilgrims flock to path of totality for Great American Eclipse of 2017\n\nKupfer, 71, said he made reservations nearly a year in advance at a short-term rental in Austin, only to have the owner cancel several months ago because, he believes, they realized they could charge more for a stay during the eclipse. Kupfer booked a second rental for a “very good price,” then was canceled again.\n\n“The one we’re in now is priced more toward what it should probably be for the eclipse,” Kupfer said.\n\nThe area in the Texas Hill Country where Kupfer and his wife are headed was strategically chosen. It will experience four minutes and 25 seconds of totality and has low chances of rain and clouds in early April, according to Astronomy.com.\n\nMeteorologist Orlando Bermudez with the National Weather Service in New Braunfels, Texas, said many people are traveling west of Austin to Kerrville where NASA is hosting an eclipse festival on April 8. Although rainy season begins in April, Bermudez said it doesn’t ramp up until May, and while prevailing southerly winds can increase morning clouds in spring, they usually clear by afternoon.\n\nThe website Eclipsophile.com considered this year’s El Niño in making weather predictions for April 8, looking at satellite measurements of cloud cover and focusing on Aprils that follow an El Niño winter.\n\nIt found Texas was the most likely to benefit from the current El Niño with clearer April skies than other areas in the eclipse path.\n\n“It would be a real bummer to get clouded out,” Kupfer said.\n\nThen something amazing happened:“Dear God, go away!” someone yelled at the cloud covering the eclipse\n\nKerrville is where Boynton Beach resident and retired astronomy professor Sam Storch, 75, is headed with a group of fellow shadow chasers. In 2017, he went to Driggs, Idaho, west of Grand Teton National Park, to watch the eclipse, which was the first in 100 years to cross the entire country.\n\n“I can think of only one other experience that was personally as intense as seeing totality and that would be actually seeing my first child literally emerge from the womb and be placed in my arms,” Storch said. “That was the only thing as intense as totality.”\n\nNorth of Austin in Bell County, Texas, officials issued a state of emergency in February to prepare for a crush of eclipse seekers that could double the county’s population of 400,000. The issuance, in part, requires landowners who plan to lease space or host parties of 50 or more people to register the event with the county and provide site plans and designate routes for emergency vehicles.\n\nFlorida's last full solar eclipse and forecast for the one to come\n\nTotal solar eclipse of 1918:What was Palm Beach County like then?\n\nFlorida's closest recent recorded brush with a full solar eclipse occurred in 1970 when North Florida fell within the moon's shadow.\n\nNext month, Pensacola will see about 76% of the sun covered by the moon.\n\nThe coverage decreases the farther south you go so that West Palm Beach will see about half of the sun covered beginning at 1:48 p.m. Maximum coverage will occur at 3:03 p.m.\n\nSeveral South Florida observatories will be open for the eclipse, including the Marmot Observatory at the Cox Science Center and Aquarium in West Palm Beach, Florida Atlantic University’s observatory in Boca Raton and the Fox Astronomical Observatory in Sunrise.\n\nSave your eyes: Take precautions when watching solar eclipse\n\nThere will be a limited amount of solar eclipse glasses available at each event. It is important never to look at the sun during an eclipse without appropriate eye protection except during the few moments of totality when the moon completely blocks the sun's face. Normal sunglasses — even those with the darkest lenses — aren’t enough to protect your eyes from damaging rays.\n\nIt’s not that the sun is any stronger during an eclipse, but where you would squint, blink and turn away from the full sun, it can be more comfortable to look at the sun as the moon moves over the bright disk.\n\nThe next total solar eclipse that crosses the entire continental United States is Aug. 12, 2045. Its path will go from Northern California through Florida with most of the Sunshine State in the path of totality.\n\n“Nowhere else in our solar system has anything like this,” said FAU astronomer Eric Vandernoot, noting the unique sun, moon and Earth configuration that allows for a total solar eclipse. “We have so much perfection set up for us.”\n\nKimberly Miller is a veteran journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

And the last time a total solar eclipse passed over Indianapolis was more than 800 years ago in 1205 when Genghis Khan was consolidating his power in China.\n\n\"That 1205 total eclipse path only covered the southwest side of the city,\" said Butler University Physics & Astronomy professor Brian Murphy in a message to IndyStar. \"For the northeast side of the city, the last total eclipse was in 831.\"\n\nMurphy, who also serves as director for the Holcomb Observatory & Planetarium, said it's not that total solar eclipses are rare — they occur every year or two somewhere on the Earth's surface — it's that width of the totality is relatively small at around 100 miles, and so they pass a given location only once every 400 years or so.\n\n\"Given our last eclipse was more than 800 years ago, we are long overdue,\" Murphy said.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the total solar eclipse moving across Indiana in 2024.\n\nWhat happens during a total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.\n\n\"In my opinion as both an astronomer and a human being is that a total solar eclipse is by far one of the most amazing things you can see in your lifetime,\" Murphy said. \"I’ve seen three total solar eclipses in my lifetime and in each occasion I was awed.\"\n\nHow to safely watch a solar eclipse.\n\nSafety should be your top priority when viewing an eclipse.\n\nIt's never safe to look directly at the sun without specialized eye protection made for solar viewing. To protect your vision, be sure you're using safe solar viewers, which are thousands of times darker than regular sunglasses and comply with international safety standards.\n\nScientists at NASA advise people watching an eclipse take the following precautions:\n\nAlways use solar viewers, or \"eclipse glasses\" to watch a solar eclipse outside the \"moment of totality,\" when the moon completely obscures the Sun.\n\nInspect your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer for scratches. If damaged, discard them.\n\nAlways supervise children using solar viewers.\n\nDO NOT look at the Sun through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses. The concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and can cause serious eye injury.\n\nlook at the Sun through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses. The concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and can cause serious eye injury. You can view the eclipse directly without proper eye protection only when the Moon completely obscures the Sun's rays. As soon as you see even a little bit of the sun, immediately put your eclipse glasses back on.\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse in 2024?\n\nMonday, April 8, 2024, is when a total solar eclipse will cross North America, cutting a 115-mile wide path through parts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada.\n\nWhere and when to see the total solar eclipse of 2024 in Indiana.\n\nAccording to NASA and Eclipse2024.org, Hoosiers will be able to watch the total solar eclipse of 2024 at the following times and places.\n\nCity Partial Eclipse Begins Total Eclipse Begins Duration ofTotal Eclipse Partial Ends Evansville 12:45 p.m. CT 2:02 p.m. CT 3 mins 2 secs. 3:20 p.m. CT Terre Haute 1:48 p.m. ET 3:04 p.m. ET 2 mins 57 secs 4:21 p.m. ET Bloomington 1:49 p.m. ET 3:04 p.m., ET 4 mins 2 secs 4:22 p.m. ET Indianapolis 1:50 p.m. ET 3:06 p.m. ET 3 mins 46 secs 4:23 p.m. ET Muncie 1:52 p.m. ET 3:07 p.m. ET 3 mins 46 secs 4:24 p.m. ET The times and locations Hoosiers living in these Indiana cities will witness a total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024.\n\nFor more details on where to watch the total solar eclipse, click the following link to a Google eclipse map created by Xavier Jubier, which supports zooming down to the street level.\n\nHolcomb Observatory and Planetarium will also provide educational programming about the eclipse.

Here's what I saw in 2017", "text": "It’s hard to believe it was already seven years ago, because the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017, still feels like a fresh memory. With the next total eclipse happening Monday in many parts of the country, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I witnessed.\n\nThe path of totality crossed over Salem, Oregon, where I grew up and where my parents still live. So I made sure to plan a visit during that time.\n\nI figured it would be something special to see. And it was, putting it mildly.\n\nHaving grown up in the Pacific Northwest with natural beauty all around, I’ve always loved nature and enjoying the great outdoors. When camping as a kid, some of my favorite memories are getting up in the night and being dazzled by the tapestry of stars overhead.\n\nYet, the idea of space and the seemingly infinite number of planets and stars is unsettling. It makes one feel so insignificant and small.\n\nWhen events like an eclipse happen, they bring to the forefront how we’re just one planet hurtling through this never-ending void.\n\nSo I was expecting to feel something along those lines. I did, but I hadn’t anticipated just how breathtaking it would be.\n\nWhat's it like to watch a solar eclipse?\n\nOn a hot (thankfully clear!) summer morning, we watched the whole thing from my parents’ backyard. The colors around us changed as the moon covered more of the sun. It was like observing a sunset in fast motion.\n\nThat moment, though, when totality occurred (when the moon fully covers the sun) was simply beautiful, with the light of the sun’s corona dancing in the sky. I don’t think I took my eyes from it the entire 2 1/2 minutes.\n\nWhat happen if you look at the eclipse?Why the total solar eclipse is as eye-damaging as it is eye-catching.\n\nMy parents and husband saw it with me, and I recently asked them what the experience was like from their perspective.\n\n“It was a whole lot cooler than I thought it was going to be,” says my hard-to-impress husband. He remembers the stars coming out and then the birds beginning to sing as if it were dawn. “It was awesome.”\n\nMy dad recalls it as “wondrous” and “delightful,” especially because he got to see it from his own yard and didn't have to contend with the flocks of people who had descended on our state.\n\nMy mom had more mixed feelings. “It felt like we were being plunged into never-ending darkness,” she recalls. Once the sun began to emerge again, she felt better.\n\nWe all describe the eclipse as unforgettable.\n\nIt's a frog! It's a demon!Actually, it's a solar eclipse.\n\nA once-in-a-lifetime event for many\n\nPart of what makes a total solar eclipse so special is that it's rare. When such events happen over large swaths of the country – as was the case in 2017 and will be on Monday – it’s a bonding experience for millions of Americans.\n\nThe excitement and buildup ahead of this year’s eclipse and the fact so many of us will watch it at the same time is reminiscent of a celestial Super Bowl.\n\nIn 2017, NASA estimates, more than 200 million U.S. adults viewed the eclipse either in person or electronically.\n\nMonday’s eclipse has the potential to reach an even wider swath of the country because of where it will arc, starting in Texas and ending in Maine. And totality will last longer this time – up to more than four minutes.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, from 1924 to 2023, only 13 total solar eclipses crossed the contiguous United States or Alaska. In the next 100 years, just 11 will be visible.\n\nAfter Monday, the next total eclipse that will cross a wide swath of the United States does not occur until 2045.\n\nMy nieces and nephews will be in 'smack middle' of path of totality\n\nThis year, I will unfortunately not be in the path of totality. But my brother and his family in Texas will be. (I'm crossing my fingers Mother Nature cooperates for them to see it clearly.)\n\nI called my nieces and nephews this week to see what they think about getting to watch the eclipse. Monday will be their first total solar eclipse, although last fall they saw the annular eclipse, which is when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth but when it is at or near its farthest point from Earth.\n\nHere’s what the kids had to say:\n\nAvila, age 14: “I’ll be very excited to be able to see a full eclipse instead of a partial one. This will be particularly interesting to be able to see the effects in the sky and in the shadows, especially with so many trees around.”\n\nAvila, who is very artistic, recalls the light from the annular eclipse in October as very “startling”: “All of the trees down the street and in our yard started to cast the most unusual and weird shadows.”\n\nLily, age 12: “I haven’t seen a full eclipse, and it sounds really exciting.”\n\nCampion, age 10: “Our house is so perfect. We’re in the smack middle of it, so it’s going to be pitch black except the cool thing is that on the horizon it will be like a giant ring.”\n\nBenedict, age 8: “It turns out the whole sky turns black when it passes over us. Isn’t that amazing? We’re going to be in the smack middle.”\n\nGerard, age 5, wasn’t as keen to talk to me about this, but he did ask his mom if he would have to go to bed during the day because it will get dark.\n\nThey all promised to send me photos and videos to document their first ever total eclipse, and I look forward to seeing it through their eyes.\n\nWherever you are, I hope you, too, can experience this magnificent event.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Here's what's going on\n\nWhen is the solar eclipse?\n\nThe solar eclipse will occur on Monday, April 8. According to NASA, Mexico’s Pacific coast will first experience the eclipse around 11:07 a.m. PDT. The eclipse path will then enter the U.S. in Texas, traveling through the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Main. Some parts of Michigan and Tennessee will also experience the phenomenon.\n\nFrom there, the eclipse will enter Canada in Southern Ontario, traveling through Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton before exiting North America on the Atlantic coast around 5:16 p.m. NDT in Newfoundland, Canada.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAccording to National Geographic, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, creating a shadow on our planet called an umbra.\n\nThere are also different kinds of eclipses. A total eclipse occurs when the moon blocks out the entire sun and a partial eclipse occurs when the moon only blocks part of the sun.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nPhyllis Lugger, an astronomy professor at IU Bloomington, witnessed a total eclipse of the sun in August of 2017 while in Salem, Oregon. “Totality itself is very awe-inspiring. It’s a remarkable shared experience that causes people with different backgrounds on different parts of the globe to be similarly awe-struck by the wonders of the natural world,” she said.\n\nAccording to the IU official website, a total eclipse takes place when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth, placing the Earth in its shadow. The time it takes place, as well as the duration, are influenced by factors like the distances between the sun, moon and Earth, the moon’s phase and the axial tilt of the Earth and moon.\n\nEdward Rhoads, lecturer in physics at the School of Science at IU Indianapolis, said the path of totality refers to the area experiencing a full eclipse. While Earth experiences a solar eclipse frequently, it’s only visible from a small area of the planet's surface. The upcoming total solar eclipse will only be seen from an area 100 miles wide.\n\nHow often do solar eclipses occur?\n\nSolar eclipses take place pretty frequently, occurring two to five times per year, according to the Natural History Museum. However, a total solar eclipse typically takes place every 18 months, around a year and a half apart.\n\nTotal solar eclipse:The eclipse will be viewable in Indiana. What makes this one so special?\n\nHow can viewers stay safe during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe following safety precautions are recommended for attendees:\n\nGet eclipse-viewing glasses early. Regular sunglasses are not safe.\n\nFill up your gas tank before traveling in the event of traffic delays.\n\nDo not stop along highways or emergency shoulders.\n\nDo not take pictures while driving. Exit the highway to view or photograph the event.\n\nTurn on headlights.\n\nDrive alert and watch for pedestrians.\n\nCome early, stay late. This will help minimize major traffic delays.\n\nPlan ahead. Book accommodations early and select a viewing destination before you travel. Locations with restrooms and food will be in high demand.\n\nTravel with enough food and water for everyone in your vehicle. Expect lines at restaurants, convenience stores and grocery stores.\n\nCheck the local weather.\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nAccording to NASA, the next total solar eclipse visible in the U.S. following the April occurrence won’t be until Aug. 23, 2044.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/04/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2024-solar-eclipse-is-right-here/73203931007/", "title": "Everything you need to know about the 2024 solar eclipse is right here", "text": "We're only days away from one of the biggest events in North America; The Great American Eclipse of 2024.\n\nOn Monday, the sun will be completely blocked by the moon along a corridor that in the US spans from Texas to Maine.

They can be very faint and difficult to photograph. Earth’s upper atmosphere distorts the sharp-edged light from the solar surface the same as it distorts starlight and causes stars to twinkle.\n\nThese are rapidly moving, long, dark bands with white spaces in between that can be seen on the sides of buildings or the ground just before and after totality. They can be very faint and difficult to photograph. Earth’s upper atmosphere distorts the sharp-edged light from the solar surface the same as it distorts starlight and causes stars to twinkle. Baily's beads: As the moon moves across the sun, points of light shine around the moon’s edges. These are called Baily's Beads and are light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon's horizon. Baily’s Beads are very short-lived and may not last long enough to be noticeable.\n\nAs the moon moves across the sun, points of light shine around the moon’s edges. These are called Baily's Beads and are light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon's horizon. Baily’s Beads are very short-lived and may not last long enough to be noticeable. Diamond ring: Baily’s Beads will begin to disappear until only a single bright spot will remain along the edge of the moon. This bright spot resembles a diamond in a giant ring formed by the rest of the sun’s atmosphere.\n\nThe 2024 eclipse is special\n\nAccording to NASA, the longest the 2017 eclipse lasted was 2 minutes, 42 seconds in Illinois. The upcoming April 8 eclipse will last for more than four minutes from Mexico to as far north as Economy, Indiana.\n\nIt will also create a wider path of totality, allowing for a greater area of viewing.\n\nSomething else that makes the 2024 eclipse unusual is the timing. The sun is on an 11-year cycle and at the solar minimum solar flares and other eruptions are least active, but during the April eclipse it will be near the peak, or solar maximum.\n\nThat gives viewers a better chance of seeing streamers extending from the corona or possibly an eruption of solar material.\n\nAlso, there won't be another total eclipse of the sun in the continental US until 2045.\n\nWhen to see the 2024 solar eclipse in Mississippi\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and earth. Regardless of where you are in Mississippi, the event will begin at about 12:30 p.m., peak a little after 1:50 p.m. and end at 3:10 p.m. or a few minutes after.\n\nClick on the map below to find out when the eclipse will happen in your area.\n\nHere's what the eclipse will look like in these Mississippi cities\n\nBay Saint Louis - 84.03%\n\nBrookhaven - 89.29%\n\nClarksdale - 96.12%\n\nColumbus - 90.62%\n\nGreenville - 94.92%\n\nGulfport - 83.75%\n\nHattiesburg - 86.56%\n\nIuka - 93.63%\n\nJackson - 90.73%\n\nMeridian - 88.17%\n\nNatchez - 90.96%\n\nOlive Branch - 96.80%\n\nOxford - 94.73%\n\nPascagoula - 82.76%\n\nPicayune - 85.23%\n\nSouthaven - 97.00%\n\nStarkville - 91.19%\n\nTupelo - 93.12%\n\nVicksburg - 91.96%\n\nWaynesboro - 86.29%\n\nTo see the percentage of eclipsing in other cities in Mississippi and the U.S., visit eclispe2024.org.\n\nPlaces near Mississippi to view the 2024 solar eclipse in totality\n\nAlthough the eclipse will be impressive in Mississippi, it won't be the same as a total eclipse of the sun.

He also noted they're inexpensive and sell for about $15 per dozen online.\n\nHe said a welder's mask will work, too. Sirola also said cameras, binoculars and telescopes should be outfitted with a filter designed for the specific purpose of viewing eclipses.\n\nYou may also see it on the ground. Sirola said as light from the eclipse passes through small openings in leaves on trees, an image of the eclipse can be projected onto the ground or flat surfaces such as a deck similar to how a primitive pinhole camera projects images onto film.\n\nAccording to NASA, this pinhole camera effect can be duplicated with a note card with a small hole in it or even with a colander by holding it between the sun and a flat surface.\n\nYou can also click here to learn how to make an eclipse viewer.\n\nDo you have a story idea?

Is it a total eclipse?", "text": "Millions of Americans could be able to see a spectacular solar eclipse onSaturday as the moon passes in front of the sun, temporarily darkening the sky over a swath of the country. But experts say the real showstopper comes in April when large portions of the country see an even more impressive total eclipse.\n\nThe October eclipse is known as an annular or \"Ring of Fire\" eclipse, where the moon slides in front of the sun but doesn't totally obscure it, creating a halo effect.\n\nBut during a total eclipse, like the one in April, the moon's apparent size from Earth will allow it to entirely cover the Sun's face, briefly turning day into night for those in its shadow.\n\n\"When it comes to the 'wow' factor, if a total solar eclipse is a 10, an annular solar eclipse is maybe a 2,\" said Dave Clark of NationalEclipse.com.\n\nHere's what to know about the two upcoming eclipses:\n\nWhat is the October annular eclipse?\n\nBecause of their relative positions, the moon won't completely block out the sun during this eclipse and instead, will leave a bright halo of light exposed around its edges, hence the \"Ring of Fire\" description. That means you'll need to wear eclipse safety glasses the entire time to protect your eyes.\n\nDuring the eclipse, the temperature will drop and the Earth will darken for those in the eclipse path. Experts say you might experience animals, insects and birds reacting as if it were twilight or dawn.\n\n\"We won't get that totality, that complete darkness,\" said Clark. \"But in terms of impressiveness, it really is the next best thing.\"\n\nThe October eclipse will be visible in a diagonal swath of the country from Oregon through Texas, weather providing.\n\nHow is a total solar eclipse, like the one in April, different?\n\nBecause the moon's orbit isn't a perfect circle, its apparent size changes in the sky. During a total eclipse, the moon is big enough to entirely cover the Sun's face, briefly turning day into night on the Earth below. Those who have seen both kinds of eclipses generally consider a total eclipse far superior to an annular one. The last total eclipse for the United States was in 2017.\n\nOctober 2023 annular solar eclipse map\n\nFor the United States, the annular eclipse will become visible atop the rising sun on the Oregon coast on Saturday morning, then pass over Eugene before swinging across northern Nevada, southern Utah, almost directly over the Four Corners area of the Southwest, and then over Albuquerque and central Texas before sweeping across the Yucatan peninsula and Belize. It will all be over in a matter of minutes for stationary observers.\n\nSpecifically, NASA says the eclipse will begin in Oregon around 9:13 a.m. PDT and end in Texas around 12:03 p.m. CDT. It will take a little more than an hour for the moon to slide completely over the sun, creating the halo effect, and then another hour or so for it to slide back off.\n\nOther parts of the United States will see a partial eclipse, where it looks like the moon has taken a bite out of the sun, but won't cover it.\n\nApril 2024 total solar eclipse map\n\nThe upcoming April total solar eclipse follows a different path than an annular eclipse, beginning in Mexico before sweeping across Texas, the Midwest, upstate New York and northern New England. For that eclipse, the length of viewing will be best in Texas, decreasing as it travels northeast.\n\nHow long will the annular October 2023 eclipse last?\n\nDepending on how close you are to the centerline of the eclipse path, it could be a little more than four minutes, and depending on where the Moon is in the sky, its shadow could be traveling across the ground at more than 3,000 mph, Clark said. If you're atop a mountain, it's possible to see the shadow sweep across the Earth below.\n\nHow long will the April 2024 total solar eclipse last?\n\nDepending on where you are, the totality will last more than four minutes, according to Clark and NASA. With this eclipse, you can remove your eclipse glasses once the moon has fully blocked out the sun and darkness has fallen. You'll need to put them back on again as the moon begins uncovering the sun again.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2024/02/12/2024-total-solar-eclipse-path-times-austin-texas-what-you-need-to-know/72190130007/", "title": "What you need to know about 2024 total solar eclipse in Austin, Texas", "text": "Austin was graced with prime views of a solar eclipse in October, and we're about to get a better show in April.\n\nThe eclipse in October was annular, meaning the moon only partially covered the sun in Austin, creating a \"ring of fire\" effect.

Total solar eclipses happen only about once every 18 months and cannot be viewed from everywhere. After 2024, the next total eclipse that will be viewable from the U.S. won't be until Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nWill the eclipse be visible from Austin?\n\nYes. Austin is in the eclipse's \"path of totality,\" which is the track of the moon's shadow across earth. This means that Austin and other parts of Central Texas will get to experience total darkness as the moon passes in front of the sun. Other areas in the U.S., outside of the path of totality, will only experience partial darkness.\n\nMore:CNN names Texas Hill Country as one of the best places to visit in the world in 2024\n\nThe last time Austin was in the path of totality, it was the 1300s.\n\nIt was 1397, to be specific.

Wear appropriate eyewear.\n\nHere are some safety tips provided by NASA:\n\nView the sun through eclipse glasses or a handheld solar viewer during the partial eclipse phases before and after totality.\n\nAlthough not recommended to watch the eclipse without specialized eye protection, it's possible to view the eclipse directly without proper eye protection only when the moon completely obscures the sun’s bright face – during the brief and spectacular period known as totality. (You’ll know it’s safe when you can no longer see any part of the sun through eclipse glasses or a solar viewer.)\n\nAs soon as you see even a little bit of the bright sun reappear after totality, immediately put your eclipse glasses back on or use a handheld solar viewer to look at the sun.\n\nWhere can I get free solar eclipse glasses?\n\nRetail company Warby Parker is giving away free, ISO-certified solar glasses in preparation of the event. They will be available April 1-8 or while supplies last. Click here to find a Warby Parker near you.\n\nToward the end of March, Texas A&M University Libraries will offer free solar eclipse glasses while supplies last. Click here to see the complete schedule.\n\nWhere to find solar eclipse glasses in stores\n\nWhile the American Astronomical Society lists large retailers selling eclipse-viewing equipment, it also warns against online purchases.

NASA says one is expected in April", "text": "Did you miss the \"ring of fire\" eclipse Saturday? The universe has you covered. Literally.\n\nA total solar eclipse is forecast on April 8, according to NASA, giving millions of people in North America a dash of darkness. The space agency said the phenomenon will pass over Mexico, the United States and Canada and make the sky appear as if it were dawn or dusk.\n\nThat brief moment of darkness will happen when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blocking the sun. Some people will be in the path of totality and – ideally wearing the proper eye protection until that moment – they'll be able to see the moon completely cover the sun. Only those in that path can remove their eclipse glasses and see it with the naked eye.\n\nIt will be the last total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous U.S. until 2044.\n\nHow long will the April 2024 eclipse last?\n\nDepending on where you're located, totality is expected to last just over four minutes.\n\nThe total eclipse will start in Mexico, then cross the U.S. in Texas around 12:23 p.m. local time and pass through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine before it exits around 2:22 p.m. local time for eastern Canada.\n\nHow can I watch the total solar eclipse?\n\nNASA recommends watching the next eclipse with proper eye covering. Officals warn that viewing the sun through a camera, binoculars or a telescope without a special solar filter could cause severe eye injuries.\n\nPeople are urged to view the eclipse through eclipse glasses or an eclipse projector.\n\n\"When watching the partial phases of the solar eclipse directly with your eyes, which happens before and after totality, you must look through safe solar viewing glasses, also known as “eclipse glasses,” or a safe handheld solar viewer at all times,\" NASA said on its eclipse website.\n\nSunglasses do not count as eclipse glasses, the space agency noted.\n\nWhere can I find eclipse glasses?\n\nThe American Astronomical Society lists suppliers with approved eclipse-viewing glasses.\n\nAccording to space.com, ISO-approved glasses must meet the following requirements:\n\nNo more than 0.00032% of sunlight may be transmitted through the filters.\n\nFilters must be free of defects including scratches, bubbles, and dents.\n\nHandheld viewers must cover both the right and left eye.\n\nProduct labels must include the manufacturer name, instructions for safe use and warnings of any dangers of improper use.\n\nSee photos from October's Ring of Fire\n\nA rare annular solar eclipse happened early Saturday.

The resulting \"totality,\" when observers can see the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, confuses animals – nocturnal creatures stir and bird and insects fall silent.\n\nThe day before the eclipse, the moon will come closest to Earth this month. On eclipse day, that means the moon is only 223,000 miles away. That proximity will make the moon appear larger in the sky, resulting in an exceptionally extended duration of sun-blocked darkness. The Earth and moon will be 93 million miles from the sun on the day of eclipse.\n\nHow long will 2024 solar eclipse last?\n\nVisit eclipse2024.org for a list of times and durations by city.\n\nSolar eclipse 2024 weather forecast in Indiana\n\nReporter Karl Schnieder examines the history of precipitation on April 8 and what to expect in 2024.\n\n2024 total solar eclipse map\n\nSolar eclipse hotels in Indiana:April's total solar eclipse selling out\n\nWhen was the last solar eclipse?\n\nAug. 21, 2017, according to NASA.\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nAccording to NASA, the next solar eclipse that will be visible for people in the U.S. won't happen again until Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nSolar eclipse 2024 Indiana glasses near me\n\nVisit indystar.com for a list of places to secure a pair of solar eclipse viewing glasses.\n\nFree solar eclipse 2024 glasses near me\n\nWarby Parker is offering free solar eclipse glasses to the public.

It will then touch southeast Canada before moving out to sea, according to NASA.\n\nThe eclipse's path will cross 13 states from Texas to Maine, and experts say the southern end of the path has the best chances for good viewing.\n\nThose who don't live on the path or can't travel to a place that is, might be wondering when their next chance to see a total solar eclipse will come. Here's what we know.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse visible from the U.S.?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again.\n\nAccording to NASA, after the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, the next total solar eclipse that can be seen from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\n2044 total solar eclipse path of totality\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse.\n\nThe Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy, says that during the 2044 eclipse, the path of totality will only touch three states.\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nIn the event of a solar eclipse, the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching a small part of our planet. Partial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight to behold.\n\nTotal eclipses can lead to a period of darkness lasting for several minutes, during which time nocturnal animals stir while confused birds and insects may fall silent, NASA says.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse reaches totality, people are able to see the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface. This offers scientists an uncommon opportunity to study the corona.\n\nTotality also offers spectators a chance to gaze upon the spectacular sight with the naked eye, though proper safety glasses are still required for the rest of the time.\n\nWhat states are on the 2024 eclipse path of totality?\n\nMexico's pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. The path will cut diagonally across the country, traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nIn the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nSee interactive maps of the 2024 path.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Ramon Padilla & Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/06/total-solar-eclipse-april-2024/11609882002/", "title": "A total solar eclipse will occur April 2024.

Next year's eclipse is the last total solar eclipse that will be visible in the U.S. until 2044.\n\nStates in the path of the eclipse are Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets in the way of the sun, turning day to an eerie twilight.\n\nPeople viewing the eclipse from locations where the moon’s shadow completely covers the sun – known as the \"path of totality\" – will experience a total solar eclipse, NASA said. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun.\n\nOutside the path of totality nearly all of North America will get a partial solar eclipse, the American Astronomical Society said.\n\nPreparations are underway\n\nSome of the big cities in the path include Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Cleveland, Buffalo and Indianapolis, where preparations already have begun. Indianapolis, which is calling itself the \"eclipse capital of the Midwest,\" is anticipating an influx of more than 1 million visitors next April, according to the city's tourism bureau.\n\nThere will even be a viewing celebration at the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto race in May.\n\nCleveland's visitor's bureau also is getting in on eclipse fever, which calls the eclipse \"a life-changing experience.\"\n\n\"The stars are literally aligning over 'The Land' for a blackout you’ll never forget. On April 8, 2024, at 3:13 p.m., Cleveland will be in the path of totality for the solar eclipse.\n\n\"If you’ve never seen an eclipse, this is the only way to do it, as the moon will block out the sun for nearly four minutes – one of the longest durations of any major city in the path of totality.\"\n\n'Four-minute solar eclipse climax'\n\nSolar eclipse enthusiasts, such as John Robinette, a self-described \"eclipse chaser\" from Takoma Park, Maryland, are already looking forward to next year's event:\n\n“If you’ve never experienced a total solar eclipse, imagine the thrill and excitement of witnessing a shooting star,\" he said. \"Amazing, right? And how long does it last? Maybe half a second?\n\n\"Now, multiply that half-second feeling of a shooting star to that of a four-minute solar eclipse climax. I guarantee you’ll never forget it and you’ll do everything you can to experience it again.\"\n\nRobinette, who traveled with his family to South Carolina to watch the eclipse in 2017, is already planning on how to view the 2024 eclipse.\n\nGet your eclipse glasses ready\n\nNASA reminds skywatchers to practice safe viewing before and after the total eclipse: \"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the moon completely blocks the sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing.\"\n\nIn fact, it's never safe to view the sun with the naked eye. The sun’s surface is so bright that if you stare at any portion of it, no matter how small, it produces enough light to permanently damage your retina.\n\nLength of time doesn't matter either. Without proper eye protection, you can suffer “eclipse blindness” – a serious injury in which the eye’s retina is damaged by solar radiation – within seconds of staring at the sun, according to the American Optometric Association.\n\nSo a pair of approved solar eclipse glasses are a must.\n\nClouds could spoil the view\n\nPast weather data indicates that \"clouds are more likely to get in the way along northern portions of the eclipse's path, while southern areas tend to have a clearer sky at the time of year coinciding with the eclipse,\" FoxWeather reports.\n\n\"Cities such as Austin and San Antonio ... average only 30 to 40% cloud coverage on an early-April afternoon,\" FoxWeather said. \"Meanwhile, the sky is typically 60 to 70% filled with clouds at the same time in places like Cleveland and Buffalo.\"\n\nAnnular solar eclipse coming to the Southwest in October\n\nFolks in the Southwest will get their own peek at a solar eclipse later this year, though it won't be a total one. An annular eclipse of the sun will be visible in the southwestern U.S. on Oct. 14, NASA said.\n\nAn annular solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth while it is at its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. \"Because the moon is farther away from Earth, it appears smaller than the sun and does not completely cover the star.\"\n\nThis creates a “ring of fire” effect in the sky. The name “annular” comes from the Latin word for ring, “annulus,” according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nOn Oct. 14, the annular eclipse will begin in the United States, traveling from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast. Weather permitting, the annular eclipse will be visible in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas, as well as some parts of California, Idaho, Colorado, and Arizona, NASA said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/03/30/solar-eclipse-2024-erie-pa-path-of-totality-tourism/69823528007/", "title": "Solar eclipse: Erie PA looks ahead to its 2024 moment in sun's ...", "text": "Big events — the kind that fill hotel rooms and provide a shot of adrenaline to the local economy — come in all shapes and sizes\n\nTall Ships Erie lasts four days.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe sky is filled with breathtaking wonders, but one occurring on April 8 is causing people to plan trips in droves, prompting fears of snarled highways and generating headline after headline.\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event — where the shadow of the moon will plunge a narrow strip of land into darkness in the middle of the day — is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\n\"The eclipse in 2024 could be even more exciting due to differences in the path, timing, and scientific research,\" reads a post from NASA. And like past similar natural phenomena, the eclipse is expected to elicit a strong emotional reaction from the people who see it, including from those who identify with its cultural significance.\n\nTotal solar eclipses over the US are rare: The next one won't happen for 20 years\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nSolar eclipses are rare in part because they can only occur during a new moon and when \"the moon's orbit is tilted five degrees to Earth's orbit around the Sun,\" according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis eclipse will pass over millions of people and be a short drive for millions more\n\nNASA estimates 215 million adults in the U.S. saw the 2017 solar eclipse either in person or electronically and even more people will likely see April's eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse's path of totality will pass over cities like Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York. And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nSearches for short-term Airbnb rentals around those areas have surged. Transportation officials in areas along the path of totality are warning residents and travelers that the eclipse could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions on roads around places with the best view.\n\nClouds could ruin total eclipse:This map shows how likely that is by city.\n\nTotal solar eclipses are awe-inspiring experiences\n\nThis year's total solar eclipse is expected to cause emotional reactions.\n\nA study of the social effects after an eclipse shows people who viewed the 2017 eclipse in its path of totality experienced feeling like part of a collective more than those who were outside of that path.\n\nResearchers found \"that astronomical events may play a vital collective function by arousing awe and social tendencies that orient individuals toward their collectives.\" They used Twitter, now X, data from millions of users to come to their conclusion.\n\nMore:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nAfter a total solar eclipse in Australia last year, The Guardian reported on a range of emotions among people who experienced the natural phenomena.

The path of totality will cross the state from southwest to northeast, passing through cities like Cleveland, Akron and just outside Columbus. During the eclipse, the moon will completely block out the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth.\n\nNext April, Ohioans will get the chance to see the sun in a way that is not possible at any other time. Here are five things you need to know about the total solar eclipse in 2024.\n\nWhere will the total solar eclipse be visible in Ohio? See the map\n\nPeople within a 124-mile-wide band in Ohio will experience the rare total solar eclipse. The path of totality will cross the state from southwest to northeast, passing through cities such as Toledo, Bowling Green, Lima, Mansfield, Akron, Cleveland, Springfield and Dayton. The total eclipse will last for approximately three minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nA map from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio also shows the location and shape of the moon's shadow during the eclipse, with the shadow over Dayton and Lima, for instance, at 3:10 p.m. and over Akron and Cleveland at 3:15 p.m.\n\nWill you be able to see the solar eclipse in Columbus?\n\nYou may need to travel outside of Columbus to see the total solar eclipse, but a partial solar eclipse will be visible in Columbus.\n\nThe moon will be relatively closer to the Earth during the eclipse, which will make it larger and last longer. However, since Columbus is outside of the path of totality, the moon will not completely block out the sun. Instead, viewers will see a partial eclipse, with the moon covering a portion of the sun's disk. The sun will become about 99% obscured in Columbus during the peak of the eclipse.\n\nMeteor showers, supermoons and more:10 astronomical events to look for in 2023\n\nWhen was the last time a total eclipse was visible in Ohio?\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse will be the first time in over 200 years that people in Ohio will be able to see a total solar eclipse.\n\nOn average, a total solar eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth every 1.5 years. However, only 21 total solar eclipses have crossed the lower 48 states in the entire existence of the United States. The last total solar eclipse visible in Ohio was in 1806. The next total solar eclipse in Ohio will be in 2099.\n\nWhere can you attend solar eclipse viewing parties locally?\n\nPlaces like COSI, Ohio Wesleyan University's Perkins Observatory, Dawes Arboretum in Newark and Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks locations have hosted viewing parties and programming during past eclipses, so keep an eye out for details closer to the eclipse.\n\nThe state of Ohio has the website eclipse.ohio.gov with information including public parks and recreational areas that would be good for viewing the eclipse.\n\nWill I need glasses to view the eclipse?\n\nYou may already be aware that this isn't your first eclipse, but you will need glasses to view this phenomenon.\n\nSpecial eclipse glasses are necessary to filter out the harmful ultraviolet and infrared light from the sun. Eclipse glasses can be purchased at many stores or can be ordered online. The eclipse can also be viewed through telescopes, binoculars and cameras with solar filters and pinhole or similar projection methods.\n\nIt is never safe to look directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse. This also applies during a total eclipse up until the sun is completely blocked, so it will be important to know when to take off and put back glasses.\n\ntmoorman@dispatch.com\n\n@taijuannichole", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/03/2024-total-solar-eclipse/71486363007/", "title": "2024 total solar eclipse: What to know about the rare event", "text": "In only a matter of three months, tens of millions of people across the continent will be able to step outside their doors and witness a rare total solar eclipse that hasn't occurred in years.\n\nAbout 20 million people were able to experience the total eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017 as it traveled along a path from Oregon to South Carolina. But when afternoon suddenly looks like nighttime once again in April, the darkness spreading across North America will last for even longer and will potentially be viewed by even more people, the Great American Eclipse website estimates.\n\nAnd you may want to make sure you're one of them.\n\nAccording to NASA, it will be 20 years before another total solar eclipse, when the moon passes between part of the Earth and the sun, temporarily blocks its light.\n\nHere's what to know about this spectacular event and how you can prepare to see it as it passes over Mexico, the United States and Canada:\n\nRecapping 2023's wild year in space:UFOs, commercial spaceflight, rogue tomatoes and more\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse is set to occur over North America on April 8, 2024.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nIn the event of a solar eclipse, the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching a small part of our planet. Partial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight to behold.\n\nTotal eclipses can lead to a period of darkness lasting for several minutes, during which time nocturnal animals stir while confused birds and insects may fall silent, NASA says.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse reaches totality, people are able to see the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface. This offers scientists an uncommon opportunity to study the corona.\n\nWhere can I see the eclipse in April?\n\nOn April 8, the moon’s shadow will arc across the Pacific, traversing North America and ending at sunset not far from Spain.\n\nIn the United States alone, 31 million people already live inside the path of totality, according to the Great American Eclipse. Of course, that figure doesn't even account for the tourists sure to flock from all over for a chance to be there when darkness falls.\n\nMexico's pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. The path will cut diagonally across the country, traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nIn the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nThe longest duration will be near Torreon in Mexico at 4 minutes and 27 seconds, almost double that of 2017, according to the Great American Eclipse.\n\nHere are some major cities inside the path:\n\nMazatlan, Sinaloa (Mexico)\n\nTorreon, Coahuila (Mexico)\n\nSan Antonio\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nDallas\n\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nIndianapolis\n\nCleveland\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nRochester, New York\n\nSyracuse, New York\n\nMontreal, Québec (Canada)\n\nHow is the 2024 eclipse different from the one in 2023?\n\nIt was just a few months ago that another type of eclipse passed over the United States.\n\nBut when the moon passed between the sun and the Earth in October, it wasn't close enough in its orbit of our planet to completely block out the sun's light. Instead, the moon appeared as a smaller disk in front of the sun, creating a bright halo of light exposed around its edges commonly known as a \"ring of fire.\"\n\nThe annular solar eclipse didn't usher in darkness such as what will occur in April, but it still attracted plenty of stargazers all the same as it was the last of its kind until 2039.\n\nHow to safely view the eclipse\n\nThe sun's powerful rays can burn the eyes and damage the retinas of those who don't wear proper eye protection or take other safety precautions to view solar eclipses.\n\nEven viewing any part of the bright sun through camera lenses, binoculars and telescopes without a specialized solar filter will instantly cause severe eye injury.\n\nThat's why NASA advises spectators to plan accordingly and ensure they have the safe – and simple – equipment needed for solar viewing.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses aren't your run-of-the-mill sunglasses: certified eyewear is held to an international safety standard and is 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. To make it easy, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society helpfully offers instructions to set them up.\n\nHowever, a total solar eclipse offers spectators a unique opportunity to momentarily remove their eyewear when it's safe. Once the moon blocks the sun's face and the sky turns dark, leaving only the solar corona visible, viewers can take off eclipse glasses or viewers to fully take in the dazzling celestial display.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

And for another: The upcoming solar eclipse on April 8 is projected to last longer, be brighter and be visible to more people than the one seven years ago, astronomers say.\n\nWith just weeks to go until the Great North American Eclipse of 2024, here's everything you know about what's going to happen and how you can (safely) see it.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon appears as the same size as the sun and blocks the entire disk from Earth, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" whereby observers can see the outmost layer of the sun's atmosphere known as the corona, confuses animals – causing nocturnal creatures to stir and bird and insects to fall silent.\n\nA recent study even found that clouds activity is altered by eclipses as shallow cumulus clouds were observed vanishing when the moon obscured the sun.\n\nWhen and where to see the April 8 total solar eclipse\n\nOn April 8, the total solar eclipse will chart a 115-mile-wide path of totality across portions of Mexico the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states lie along the path. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path, while millions more tourists are already making travel plans – sure to snarl traffic – to catch a glimpse of what is sure to be a spectacular sight, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says.\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending it's time in the U.S. around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine and entering Canada's maritime provinces, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes. And as if the dazzling solar eclipse won't be enough, there's a small chance that the horned \"devil comet\" may make an appearance that same day as it makes its closest orbital approach to Earth later in the month.\n\nIf you want to see the time and duration for when totality would occur near each of these locations, see these interactive maps.\n\nHow to safely view the solar eclipse\n\nUnlike partial solar eclipses, a total eclipse offers spectators a unique opportunity to gaze upon it with the naked eye, but only when the moon completely blocks out the sun and darkness falls.\n\nWhile you're unlikely to go blind, gazing directly at the sun's rays can do some serious damage to your retinas. So until the moment that totality occurs, proper safety eyewear is still a must, according to NASA.\n\nWhile some welding goggles may work, the best best remains certified eyewear, which is held to an international safety standard and is 100,000 times darker than most sunglasses to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet, but if you want to save some cash, there's a good chance your local library or another public institution is giving them away for free.\n\nJust watch out for cheap imitations. To make it easy while you're shopping online, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society offers helpful instructions to set them up as well.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse after 2024?\n\nWhether you live on the path of totality or need to find the nearest city that will be enveloped in daytime darkness, one thing is for sure: Now is the time to make your plans to see it.\n\nFor North America, the next total solar eclipse won't be until Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse.\n\nThe Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy, says that during the 2044 eclipse, the path of totality will only touch three states.\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

And for another: The upcoming solar eclipse on April 8 is projected to last longer, be brighter and be visible to more people than the one seven years ago, astronomers say.\n\nWith just weeks to go until the Great North American Eclipse of 2024, here's everything you know about what's going to happen and how you can (safely) see it.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon appears as the same size as the sun and blocks the entire disk from Earth, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" whereby observers can see the outmost layer of the sun's atmosphere known as the corona, confuses animals – causing nocturnal creatures to stir and bird and insects to fall silent.\n\nA recent study even found that clouds activity is altered by eclipses as shallow cumulus clouds were observed vanishing when the moon obscured the sun.\n\nWhen and where to see the April 8 total solar eclipse\n\nOn April 8, the total solar eclipse will chart a 115-mile-wide path of totality across portions of Mexico the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states lie along the path. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path, while millions more tourists are already making travel plans – sure to snarl traffic – to catch a glimpse of what is sure to be a spectacular sight, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says.\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending it's time in the U.S. around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine and entering Canada's maritime provinces, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes. And as if the dazzling solar eclipse won't be enough, there's a small chance that the horned \"devil comet\" may make an appearance that same day as it makes its closest orbital approach to Earth later in the month.\n\nIf you want to see the time and duration for when totality would occur near each of these locations, see these interactive maps.\n\nHow to safely view the solar eclipse\n\nUnlike partial solar eclipses, a total eclipse offers spectators a unique opportunity to gaze upon it with the naked eye, but only when the moon completely blocks out the sun and darkness falls.\n\nWhile you're unlikely to go blind, gazing directly at the sun's rays can do some serious damage to your retinas. So until the moment that totality occurs, proper safety eyewear is still a must, according to NASA.\n\nWhile some welding goggles may work, the best best remains certified eyewear, which is held to an international safety standard and is 100,000 times darker than most sunglasses to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet, but if you want to save some cash, there's a good chance your local library or another public institution is giving them away for free.\n\nJust watch out for cheap imitations. To make it easy while you're shopping online, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society offers helpful instructions to set them up as well.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse after 2024?\n\nWhether you live on the path of totality or need to find the nearest city that will be enveloped in daytime darkness, one thing is for sure: Now is the time to make your plans to see it.\n\nFor North America, the next total solar eclipse won't be until Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse.\n\nThe Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy, says that during the 2044 eclipse, the path of totality will only touch three states.\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore these interactive maps.\n\nTypes of eclipses\n\nIs that a bit confusing? Here's a breakdown of the types of eclipses, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is between the sun and Earth, completely obscuring the sun. During a total solar eclipse, viewers can see the sun's corona -- its outer atmosphere -- which is generally obscured by the sun's brightness.\n\nWhat is an annular solar eclipse?\n\nAn annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, but it's at or near its farthest point from Earth. Because the moon is so far away from Earth, it's smaller than the sun and doesn't completely cover the sun. When this happens, the moon appears as a dark circle in front of the sun, surrounded by a bright ring.\n\nWhat is a partial solar eclipse?\n\nA partial solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, but aren't perfectly lined up, giving the sun a crescent shape.\n\nWhat is a total lunar eclipse?\n\nIn a total lunar eclipse, the moon moves into the inner part of the Earth's shadow. Some of the light passing through Earth's atmosphere reaches the moon's surface, giving the moon an orange or reddish color. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon will appear.\n\nWhat is a partial lunar eclipse?\n\nIn a partial lunar eclipse, the sun, Earth and moon align imperfectly, which leads to the moon passing through only part of Earth's shadow. The shadow only partially obscures the moon.\n\nWhat is a prenumbral eclipse?\n\nYou're likely not to see this one. In a prenumbral eclipse, the moon travels through the faint part of the Earth's shadow, causing the moon to dim only very slightly.\n\nContact IndyStar newsroom development director Holly Hays at holly.hays@indystar.com.

Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun’s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun.\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total solar eclipse is on Monday, April 8.\n\nThe duration of totality will last four minutes and 27 seconds, nearly double that of the total solar eclipse seen in the United States in 2017, according to Great American Eclipse.\n\nAlthough the next total solar eclipse will be visible elsewhere on Aug. 12, 2026, if you miss out on April 8, the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous U.S. won’t arrive until Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nWhat time will the total solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe path of totality — when the moon completely covers the sun, creating a total eclipse — runs from Mexico (Sinaloa to Coahuila) to the United States (Texas to Maine) to Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland), according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nThe following U.S. cities are in the path of totality, according to NASA:\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nEvansville, Indiana\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nAreas near these cities will experience a partial eclipse before and after the time totality is expected. A partial eclipse will be visible across nearly all of the U.S. and a small portion of western Europe.\n\nGlobal eclipse events will occur at the following local times:\n\nPartial eclipse will first be visible at 11:42 a.m.\n\nFull eclipse will first be visible at 12:38 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse will be visible at 2:17 p.m.\n\nFull eclipse will last be visible at 3:55 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse will last be visible at 4:52 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43,800,000 people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible. As for any part of the eclipse, not just totality, 8.19% of the population, or 652,000,000 people, will be able to tune in, according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nEclipse trip:Want to head out of town for a better view of the April solar eclipse? Here's where to go\n\nWhat will Delaware see during the eclipse?\n\nDelaware is not in the path of totality, so only a partial eclipse will be seen in the Small Wonder.\n\nEclipse action in Delaware will take place at the following times:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nEclipse viewing:The total solar eclipse will be here soon. Here's where you can plan to watch in Delaware\n\nStages of a total solar eclipse\n\nMany people focus on the moment of totality when they think of a total solar eclipse, but there are actually several distinct stages of the event that those observing can keep an eye out for.\n\nHere are the phases of a total solar eclipse, most of which Delawareans can look forward to, according to NASA:\n\nDuring a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover the sun at first, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape. When the moon first touches the sun, it is also called the “first contact.”\n\nShadow bands are long, dark, rapidly moving bands separated by white spaces that can be seen on the ground or on the sides of buildings just before or after totality.\n\nBaily’s beads are the several points of light that shine around the moon’s edges as it continues to move across the sun. They are caused by light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon’s horizon. Baily’s Beads appear for only a short amount of time and may not be noticeable to everyone watching the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe diamond ring effect occurs at the beginning and end of totality during a total solar eclipse. As Baily’s beads begin to disappear, and the last bits of sunlight pass through the valleys on the moon’s limb, the faint corona around the sun is just becoming visible along the edge of the moon’s shadow and looks like a ring with shining diamonds on it.\n\nTotality occurs once the diamond ring disappears and there is no longer any direct sunlight, also known as “second contact.” At this point, eclipse viewers may be able to see the chromosphere — a region of the solar atmosphere that appears as the thin circle of pink around the moon — and the corona, appearing as streams of white light.\n\nAs the moon continues to move across the sun, brightening will appear on the opposite side from where the diamond ring appeared at the beginning. This is the lower atmosphere of the sun beginning to peek out from behind the moon. Your eclipse glasses must be on before the first flash of sunlight appears around the edges of the moon, known as “third contact.”\n\nAs the final stages of the eclipse commence, the beginning process you just witnessed will be mirrored. The diamond ring will appear first, followed by Bailey’s beads and the shadow bands before the entire sun is visible again. “Fourth contact” is the moment that none of the sun is covered by the moon’s shadow and signals the end of the eclipse.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

To protect your vision, be sure you're using safe solar viewers, which are thousands of times darker than regular sunglasses and comply with international safety standards.\n\nScientists at NASA advise people watching an eclipse take the following precautions:\n\nAlways use solar viewers, or \"eclipse glasses\" to watch a solar eclipse outside the \"moment of totality,\" when the moon completely obscures the Sun.\n\nInspect your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer for scratches. If damaged, discard them.\n\nAlways supervise children using solar viewers.\n\nDO NOT look at the Sun through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses. The concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and can cause serious eye injury.\n\nlook at the Sun through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses. The concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and can cause serious eye injury. You can view the eclipse directly without proper eye protection only when the Moon completely obscures the Sun's rays. As soon as you see even a little bit of the sun, immediately put your eclipse glasses back on.\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse in 2024?\n\nMonday, April 8, 2024, is when a total solar eclipse will cross North America, cutting a 115-mile wide path through parts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada.\n\nWhere and when to see the total solar eclipse of 2024 in Indiana.\n\nAccording to NASA and Eclipse2024.org, Hoosiers will be able to watch the total solar eclipse of 2024 at the following times and places.\n\nCity Partial Eclipse Begins Total Eclipse Begins Duration ofTotal Eclipse Partial Ends Evansville 12:45 p.m. CT 2:02 p.m. CT 3 mins 2 secs. 3:20 p.m. CT Terre Haute 1:48 p.m. ET 3:04 p.m. ET 2 mins 57 secs 4:21 p.m. ET Bloomington 1:49 p.m. ET 3:04 p.m., ET 4 mins 2 secs 4:22 p.m. ET Indianapolis 1:50 p.m. ET 3:06 p.m. ET 3 mins 46 secs 4:23 p.m. ET Muncie 1:52 p.m. ET 3:07 p.m. ET 3 mins 46 secs 4:24 p.m. ET The times and locations Hoosiers living in these Indiana cities will witness a total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024.\n\nFor more details on where to watch the total solar eclipse, click the following link to a Google eclipse map created by Xavier Jubier, which supports zooming down to the street level.\n\nHolcomb Observatory and Planetarium will also provide educational programming about the eclipse.

This meets upcoming lessons, ongoing work and reading on the celestial wonder.\n\n\"All my classes that day: We'll talk about the eclipse,\" he said.\n\nKendra Moritz Rosner couldn't agree more. She hopes everyone in the building is talking solar eclipse.\n\nNot only is the educator at Lorewood Grove Elementary ready to take students out during the natural event, Moritz Rosner has been prepping lessons and material for teachers across her school. After 17 years of teaching, the STEAM coordinator now looks to teach students across grade levels about the engineering and design processes behind subjects like science, technology, engineering, art/agriculture and math/music.\n\nLeading up to April 8, that also will look like counsel on viewing safety, from solar glasses and goggles, to pinhole-projector creation with older students.\n\n\"It turns out, as a school, we're going to go ahead and do this,\" Moritz Rosner said with a smile. \"So while I'm kind of bringing the 'What is this exactly that we're going to see in the sky,' all of the teachers — at least third, fourth and fifth — are going to get the kids ready to actually go outside. And as long as it's a beautiful day, we'll be able to see the solar eclipse.\"\n\nShe knows something like this can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Why?\n\nViewers cannot look directly at the sun without eye protection specifically designed for solar viewing. Without it, the sun’s radiation can instantly burn the retina, leading to permanent eye damage or blindness. Even sunscreen and protective clothing are encouraged for those planning to be outside for hours.\n\nEclipse prep:Where to get solar eclipse glasses, eclipse safety and how to make your own solar viewers\n\nWherever onlookers choose to get glasses from, as previously reported, they need to make sure the frames meet safety requirements of the ISO 12312-2 international standard and are sold from a reputable seller acknowledged by the American Astronomical Society. Make plans soon, as reports showed places selling out close to similar events.\n\nOne can also indirectly view the eclipse using a pinhole projector, easily made at home.\n\nLike Delaware, a partial eclipse will be visible across nearly all of the U.S. and a small portion of western Europe. During such a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover it, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape.\n\nThe path of totality — when the moon completely covers the sun, creating a total eclipse, as previously reported — runs from Mexico (Sinaloa to Coahuila) to the United States (Texas to Maine) to Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland).\n\nLorewood Grove's Moritz Rosner is looking forward to teaching students about more aspects than an eye in the sky.

For some, it's evidence of higher power. For ...", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 5.\n\nOn April 8 in Gatesville, Texas, members of Coryell Community Church will congregate at the campus’ hilltop site where a trio of 70-foot crosses tower over the city of 17,000, 38 miles west of Waco.\n\nThe region lies in the center of the approaching solar eclipse’s path of totality, the last such event to affect the contiguous United States until 2044. Ancient cultures viewed the dusk-like darkness prompted by the passing of the moon between the Earth and the sun, temporarily blocking the sun’s light, as a sign of the gods’ anger or even their impending departure.\n\nInstead, Coryell’s “Eclipse of the Crosses” family gathering will feature live music, games and worship – an occasion to celebrate. Meanwhile, organizers at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo have bought a thousand eclipse glasses for a viewing event, complete with black-and-white half-moon cookies.\n\nIs the April 2024 eclipse safe for pets?Why experts want you to leave them at home.\n\nAs the faithful convene in scattered Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities around the country, the gatherings reflect how celestial events once seen as ominous by some religious communities continue to wield spiritual significance today.\n\n“An eclipse is yet another opportunity to witness the handiwork of God that exists in the universe,” said Eric Moffett, Coryell’s lead pastor. “We aren’t looking for any omens in the cosmos, but we are using this as an opportunity to, for a little over four minutes, be reminded that we live in a world made by God and sustained by his love and goodness.”\n\nEclipses have inspired fear and awe among civilizations throughout history, from the Aztecs to the ancient Hindus. They're also associated with some major religious events, including the darkness that accompanied Jesus’ crucifixion in Christianity and, in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad’s son, Ibrahim.\n\nAs the Bible's Gospel of Mark 15:33 reads: \"And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\"\n\nSuch references often emphasize the power of God over the cosmos, said James Willis, an assistant professor of practice for religion at the University of Indianapolis.\n\n“What we today see as an astronomical event, people previously interpreted as having life-and-death significance,\" Willis said.\n\nEarlier this month, in the Choctaw Nation newspaper Biskinik, a recurring column exploring Choctaw culture noted the sun was considered to bring life and good fortune; for some communities, when solar eclipses occurred, it was as if great black squirrels in the sky were devouring the sun. In response, all were called upon to make noise to frighten them away.\n\nBradley Schaefer, a professor of astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said in most pre-modern cultures, the sun god was among the most powerful deities in the pantheon. An eclipse represented the destruction of that god – or at least a dire sign.\n\n“Where better to put signs from the gods but in the heavens?” Schaefer said. “If you see a sign in the heavens, it’s got to be from the gods. They’re telling us something, and what was universal from culture to culture is that it was always bad.”\n\nIn Islam, eclipses offer an occasion to pray\n\nFourteen centuries ago, as Islam’s Muhammad and his supporters grieved his deathly ill son, the prophet watched the toddler breathe his last as the skies darkened above them – the beginning, it is believed, of a total eclipse.\n\nAs the story goes, speculation spread among Muhammad’s followers that even the sun and moon were grieving his loss. In response, he summoned them to prayer and dispelled that notion, but added that such events, as signs of God’s power, should nonetheless inspire them to pray.\n\nOmid Safi, a professor of Islamic studies at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, said tradition holds that both solar and lunar eclipses are “divine matters unfolding in nature” while honoring the prophet’s “steadfast refusal to use the fortuitous occasion of a solar eclipse at the passing of his son as a way of bolstering his own standing.”\n\nWhile Islam’s eclipse prayer is not a mandatory one, many still take time to recite it. During last fall’s annular eclipse, Muslim Americans around the U.S. gathered in places such as the Muslim Community Center–East Bay in Pleasanton, California; The Mecca Center in Willowbrook, Illinois; and Commons Park in Fridley, Minnesota.\n\nNadia Abuisnaineh, who volunteers as a NASA solar system ambassador in the Minneapolis area, organized the Minnesota event hoping not only to pique her community’s scientific curiosity but also its sense of identity as Muslims.\n\nStill, she had no idea the public gathering would come as Palestinians scrambled to evacuate northern Gaza in anticipation of a massive counteroffensive by Israeli forces, a week after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. The timing made the gathering all the more powerful, she said.\n\n“My community was very hurt, and for them, it was a time to reflect and ask God to alleviate the pain and suffering,” Abuisnaineh said. “I never imagined that five months later, with the second eclipse coming, that we would still have to think about this and be advocating for our brothers and sisters in Palestine.”\n\nThose who witnessed the October eclipse were overcome by the event, she recalled, in particular, two older people who were moved to tears.\n\n“Whether they were tears of grief because of what was happening in Gaza or just being overwhelmed by the eclipse and strengthening their relationship with God, it’s a privilege to allow people to do that,” she said.\n\nWith the April 8 event coming during the most intense period of Ramadan, Abuisnaineh isn’t planning to arrange another prayer gathering. Instead, she plans to remind community members to use the time to reflect.\n\nAn avid stargazer who takes any opportunity to view the night sky, she’s not about to miss a solar eclipse.\n\n“If it’s sunny, I’ll take out all my eclipse glasses and knock on every door in my neighborhood,” Abuisnaineh said. “It’s just a bummer to live your life and not know these things happen.”\n\nEclipse for kids?Decoding the sky: A definitive solar eclipse guide for kids (adults also welcome)\n\nA warning of God’s imminent wrath?\n\nPerspectives on eclipses vary widely within the Jewish community, said Mark Horowitz, chief operating officer for the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo, New York. More conservative members, he said, still consider them warnings, especially for those in their path of totality.\n\n“There are a lot of people who don’t believe it’s a time for putting on glasses, getting together and drinking or whatever people are going to do,” Horowitz said. “Some people believe it’s a time for prayer and introspection.”\n\nThe Hebrew word for eclipse, he noted, translates to “defect.”\n\nWeather on eclipse day:Everything to know about Monday's total solar eclipse: Latest forecast includes optimism\n\n“When the luminaries are stricken, it is an ill omen for the world,” reads the Talmud, a central text of Judaism. The passage offers the example of a king who, after preparing a feast for his servants, becomes angry with them and orders the removal of the lantern illuminating their banquet.\n\nEven now, some say celestial happenings warn of God’s imminent wrath; some have even claimed they bear political significance. In November 2022, some ultraconservative Christian pastors said the approaching blood moon lunar eclipse portended a surge of Republican midterm wins.\n\n“God is warning America of impending disaster and destruction,” Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of iconic evangelist Billy Graham and founder of AnGel Ministries, wrote on her blog as the solar eclipse of August 2017 approached.\n\nMore recently, Lotz has seen speculation among some that the combined paths over the U.S. of this year’s eclipse and the previous two solar eclipses appear to mimic the shapes of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet – in other words, the beginning and the end.\n\n“Maybe people are reading too much into it,” she said. “But when you look at the world, you don’t need an eclipse to know that things are getting really dangerous. Maybe it’s telling us it’s time to get right with God and the people in our lives so that we have no regrets.”\n\nEclipses offer a spiritual experience, even for nonbelievers\n\nSchaefer, of Louisiana State University, said as the science behind eclipses began to be understood, some used such knowledge to their advantage, among them Christopher Columbus, who in 1504 was shipwrecked with his crew in Jamaica and for months relied on local natives to provide food in exchange for trinkets.\n\nAs those gifts started to wear thin, the natives refused to continue, Schaefer said. Columbus seized on the idea of using an approaching lunar eclipse to convince the locals he could commune with the gods and make the moon disappear.\n\n“That’s the beauty of science, is when you make predictions they come true,” Schaefer said. “Columbus knew it was just a shadow. But the Jamaicans saw it as a death of a god. Once you understand what an eclipse is, it’s no longer the realm of the gods.”\n\nStill, he said, even the way Americans view eclipses has changed over time. Accounts of New Yorkers witnessing a total eclipse in 1924 described silent crowds of people solemnly taking it in.\n\n“Now it’s just raucous fun,” Schaefer said. “No one is fearful that Jupiter will come down and steal their soul.”\n\nWitnessing a solar eclipse, however, can provide a spiritual experience, even for those who aren’t necessarily religious, he and others said.\n\nFormer NASA engineers Jeff Stone and his wife, Susan, will be experiencing the eclipse from their hilltop home in Kerrville, Texas.\n\n“Her priority was to have a nice view,” Stone said. “My priority was to be as close to the centerline of the eclipse as possible. We managed to do both.”\n\nWhen they worked as flight controllers for the Space Shuttle program at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, the couple traveled to Mexico in 1991 to experience nearly seven minutes of totality when a solar eclipse passed over the region. They’ve been eclipse-chasers ever since.\n\nOn April 8, the Stones will host a dozen-plus visitors from as far away as Sweden to experience this year’s event.\n\n“It’s such an emotional event,” Stone said. “It touches your soul, it really does. Any time you realize there’s something bigger than you, it gives you perspective. Surely that power has a purpose.”\n\nIn Buffalo, Horowitz said the eclipse, an obvious reminder of nature’s beauty, offers a chance to reflect on nature’s fragility and to find hope amid worldly chaos and personal challenges.\n\n“You can sometimes be clouded by all that darkness,” he said. “The natural world is trying to tell us that beyond the darkness, there is light.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}]}

Meteorologists continue to refine their cloud cover forecasts for the big day, and as of Wednesday, it's a mix of good and bad news, depending on your location. More about that in a moment.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, April 8, a total eclipse of the sun will cross over a dozen states as it traverses from Texas to Maine. Millions of people are expected to travel to see it.\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality can still use eclipse glasses (maybe free eclipse glasses) to see the moon pass in front of the sun — if it's not blocked by clouds.\n\nMeanwhile, those planning to order glasses online may be rapidly running out of time to do so in order to have them delivered on time.\n\nHere's the latest news about the 2024 total solar eclipse on April 8:\n\nWhere will skies be clear for the total eclipse?\n\nFirst, the good news. \"Clear skies in the path of totality are most likely in northern New England and upstate New York, and possible in Arkansas and Missouri,\" the Weather Prediction Center, a branch of the National Weather Service, said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe weather service forecast office in Burlington, Vermont, also gave this optimistic outlook: \"The forecast for Monday is looking spectacular across the North Country (of Vermont).\" The weather service calls for \"great viewing conditions, as mostly clear skies are now in the forecast around eclipse time.\"\n\nTexas solar eclipse forecast is troublesome\n\nThe forecast worsens the farther south and west you go.\n\n\"Cloud cover in the path of totality is most likely in south-central Texas, as well as portions of the Ohio Valley, including Indiana, Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania,\" the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nAccuWeather lead long-range forecaster Paul Pastelok said, \"Most places in the vicinity of the path of totality will have to deal with some level of clouds, whether high or low.\"\n\nThe weather service forecast office in Dallas-Ft. Worth was slightly more upbeat about the type of clouds that will be in the area on Monday: \"The forecast for Eclipse Day continues to be cloudy, however, not all hope is lost!,\" the weather service said. \"Widespread upper cloud cover is likely, but dense low clouds look less likely! There is a medium chance of partial visibility across parts of North and Central Texas.\"\n\nWill clouds really ruin the eclipse?\n\nClouds are just part of weather, and as noted in the latest forecast, it's likely that some of the millions of people in the path of totality for April's total eclipse will have to endure overcast skies that will impact the experience.\n\nBut determining how clouds would change your view depends on the types of clouds – and which expert you ask. Some advise eclipse watchers to not worry about the skies, others say an overcast sky can ruin the experience.\n\nBefore last year's annular solar eclipse, National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Daldrup told Oregon Public Radio that if clouds are in the forecast, you should hope for the \"right kind of clouds.\"\n\n“If we want to see it, we’ll want the higher-level clouds,” Daldrup told OPR. “Those tend to be the more feathery cirrus clouds that can still be seen through. They might obstruct the eclipse but you can still see it.”\n\nCirrus clouds would be in contrast to some of the more eclipse-unfriendly clouds, such as a thick deck of lower-level stratus or cumulus clouds that would likely completely block the sun.\n\nOrder eclipse glasses online now to have them delivered on time\n\nIf you're planning to be among the millions of people in the United States who will witness the spectacular sight on April 8, having a proper pair of glasses is paramount: The sun's rays will pose a danger to unprotected retinas gazing skyward.\n\nIf you're buying your specs through American Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, the company makes it easy for you with a countdown at the top of its website for how much longer you have to procrastinate. As of Wednesday morning, customers have little more than two days to make their purchase and take advantage of the company's express shipping across the country.\n\nThat's about the same amount of time allotted to Walmart+ online shoppers, as well as Prime members looking for reputable glasses on Amazon.\n\nMany eclipse websites like GreatAmericanEclipse.com and NationalEclipse.com also sell a variety of eyewear products, along with plenty of other gadgets — but double check that estimated delivery date before checking out.\n\nWhat is the path of totality and why does it matter?\n\nThis eclipse is all about totality. But what is it? Basically, totality is when the moon totally blocks the sun during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe path of totality is the area where people on Earth can see the moon completely cover the sun as the moon's shadow falls upon them. In the U.S., the path of totality of this eclipse stretches from Texas to Maine.\n\nTo view all of the stages of a total solar eclipse, you must watch it from somewhere along that path of totality, NASA said. Viewers outside this narrow, roughly 115-mile wide path will only see a partial eclipse of the sun.\n\nIf you're not in the path of totality, hundreds of millions of people across the nation will still be able to view the partial eclipse, weather permitting: \"The best locations for viewing can be the Southwest and the East, especially east of the Appalachians,\" AccuWeather lead long-range forecaster Paul Pastelok said. \"Cities like El Paso, Albuquerque, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., New York City and Raleigh should all have great views.\"\n\n\"The area from West Texas to southern Arizona should also have favorable viewing conditions,\" Pastelok added. \"These areas will be close to the path of totality with the least amount of cloud cover anticipated.\"\n\nIs the April 2024 eclipse safe for pets?\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse.\n\nExperts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and anxious people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” she said.\n\nDogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\nDr. Jerry Klein, chief veterinarian of the American Kennel Club, said dogs that are sensitive, that have anxiety or are strongly affected by storms are likely to pick up on the emotions of people gathering to watch the eclipse\n\nThat’s especially true for pet owners who might be traveling a long distance to see the eclipse.\n\nHow are schools are handling the total solar eclipse\n\nLocal governments and organizations have been bracing for months to accommodate the millions of Americans hoping to witness the eclipse.\n\nAmongst those planning for the special day are schools, especially those in states in the path of totality. A lot of foresight and logistics go into managing excitement around such a rare event, and school districts across the 13 states in the eclipse's path have been prepping their students, parents and educators well in advance.\n\nStates and districts are taking different approaches: some will dismiss students early or close entirely, while others will find ways to incorporate the celestial event into the day's curriculum.\n\nSchools in each state are handling the rare event in their own way, but one thing widely agreed upon by both educators and parents alike – the eclipse is a rare and exciting teaching opportunity.\n\nTraffic likely to be snarled\n\nExperts warn the eclipse excitement could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions as people pack into the narrow band of the country with the best view.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally, people will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokesperson for the American Automobile Association.\n\nRoads could be especially packed at the center of the eclipse's path as Americans who want the best view crowd into cities, towns and remote areas, many without the infrastructure to handle big crowds.\n\nIn Ohio's Lorain County, county officials are warning residents to be aware about the increase in visitors, traffic and jammed roads — and possible cell phone signal drops.\n\n“What we could have is crowds here that we’re not used to,” said Dave Freeman, the director of Lorain County Emergency Management. “We’re not set up infrastructure-wise for that, we don’t have the roads.”\n\nHow to photograph a solar eclipse with your cell phone\n\nYou'll need to have the right solar filter in front of your cellphone camera to protect both your device and eyesight, according to Carly Stocks, a Utah-based astronomical photographer who talked to USA TODAY.\n\nThe filter must be made specifically for solar viewing, Stocks said. She also emphasized the need to place a filter that is larger than the lens itself and to keep it on at all times if you're in a location where the eclipse is only partially visible. She recommends purchasing a small 4- by 4-inch sheet of the Thousand Oaks solar filter.\n\nAnd if you're observing the sky in a location where the total eclipse is visible, you'll have a moment when you can take off the solar lens entirely and capture unfiltered images.\n\n\"During totality, you can remove all filters,\" Stocks told USA TODAY. \"If you're looking with the solar glasses and you don't see anything, then it's safe to look at it during that time.\"\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse visible from the U.S.?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again.\n\nAccording to NASA, after the total solar eclipse on April 8, the next total solar eclipse that can be seen from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse on April 8?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nNASA will launch 3 rockets into space during the eclipse\n\nNASA is preparing to launch three giant rockets into our atmosphere on the day of the eclipse. The agency is hoping to gather some valuable scientific data about how solar eclipses alter Earth’s upper atmosphere.\n\nNASA is using spacecraft called sounding rockets that are equipped with scientific instruments to take measurements and perform experiments during its sub-orbital flight.\n\nThe three rockets will launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and will reach an intended altitude of 260 miles, NASA said. That's high enough to study disturbances during a total solar eclipse in the ionosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between 55 to 310 miles above the ground.\n\nScientists hope to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance during the eclipse creates disturbances that could interfere with communications here on Earth.\n\n“Understanding the ionosphere and developing models to help us predict disturbances is crucial to making sure our increasingly communication-dependent world operates smoothly,\" said mission leader Aroh Barjatya, an engineering physicist at Florida's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nEclipse one of many reasons 'flat Earth' claims are nonsense\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, skeptics continue to believe the Earth is flat, a conspiracy theory experts say dangerously feeds into paranoia and spurs an unhealthy skepticism of all science and credible authorities.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact-Check Team has debunked an array of flat Earth-related claims, including that Antarctica is really an ice wall around a flat Earth and the related conspiracy theory that space – and space travel – isn't real.\n\nExperts say the debunked flat Earth conspiracy theory doesn't slow down when an eclipse happens – even though the event is precisely explained because of scientists' deep understanding of celestial bodies and their orbits.\n\nSpeaking about the skeptics, Jeffrey Blevins, a professor of journalism at the University of Cincinnati, said \"They’re not just primed to believe the Earth is flat, they’re primed to believe you can’t trust science, academics, the media or government,” he said. “And it might also lead you to see other extremist views as plausible.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/17/2024-solar-eclipse-interactive-map-path-totality-duration/72539478007/", "title": "2024 solar eclipse interactive maps: Cities on path, totality duration", "text": "Come Monday, millions of Americans from Texas to Maine will stop what they're doing to step outside and spend a few minutes gazing skyward.\n\nFew celestial events have the power to capture our collective attention the way this upcoming total solar eclipse has managed to do.

That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in 2017. But astronomers say there won't be any comparison between that eclipse and the one coming Monday. For the 2024 eclipse, the corona will be brighter, the moon will appear larger and totality will last just a bit longer than it did seven years ago.\n\nWhat U.S. cities and states are on the path of totality?\n\nThe 115-mile-wide eclipse will provide millions of spectators with a front row seat to its majesty as it passes through Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of cities and small towns fall directly on the path of totality.

Even the city's name, he added, is perfect for the astronomical event. \"But if we had a big festival with thousands of people here, we'd have to worry about safety.\"\n\nSo, Gardner said, as much as the city wants to host an eclipse festival, it won't.\n\nThat, however, hasn't put a damper on the excitement from residents, including some of the city's youngest schoolchildren who are learning about space in their classrooms and at the library, and some out-of-town astronomy enthusiasts, who are planning to set up their telescopes on the city's curved, 800-foot-long pier.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about it,\" Gardner said. \"It's the hot topic of conversation.\"\n\n'In our own backyard'\n\nAt Central Elementary school, 4- and 5-year-olds recently got their first lesson about the eclipse from Miss Madilyn.\n\nIt started Thursday morning with a class discussion about why, when the eclipse occurs next month — or anytime, really — no one should look directly at the sun, unless, they are wearing special, protective glasses: You could go blind.\n\nLater, the youngsters went outside with the sunshine, to try the eyewear on.\n\nFor months, the superintendent, Kelli Tuller, said, Mason Consolidated Schools has been planning to turn the rare daytime solar eclipse into what educators call a \"teachable moment.\"\n\n\"We are explaining what the eclipse means and why it’s exciting and important,\" Tuller said. \"The eclipse is set to happen right in the middle of our bus dismissal time for our elementary kids.\"\n\nSo, the district purchased more than 1,250 cardboard safety glasses, enough to protect the eyes of every elementary, middle and high school student, teacher, administrator — and staff member, including the bus drivers.\n\nTuller added that while some people are booking special, cross-country flights in hopes of catching a glimpse of the eclipse from an airplane, they won't have to do that. District students will be able to watch the eclipse \"in our own backyard.\"\n\n'Keep your eyes safe'\n\nOn the playground, Madilyn Hafner blew a whistle, the signal for the kids to line up.\n\n\"Remember, boys and girls, we talked about glasses this morning?\" Miss Madilyn said in her sweetest preschool teacher voice. She handed out the eyewear, while, at the same time, urging a student holding a wriggling worm to set it back down in the dirt. \"We're going to practice using them.\"\n\nAt first, Merlin Sorensen, 5, of Luna Pier, said: \"I can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the purpose,\" Miss Madilyn told him, before realizing that he was right, unless he used the glasses to look at the sun. \"It helps keep your eyes safe. Don't look at the sun without them.\"\n\nAs the preschoolers' eyes adjusted, they blurted out whatever popped into their heads.\n\n\"I can see space,\" 5-year-old Emma Sue Atkins, who was wearing corduroy pants covered with unicorns and hearts. She said her full name as if it were all one word. She added, \"I can see the sun!\"\n\nMiss Madilyn asked them: \"What shape does it look like?\"\n\n\"A circle,\" several replied in unison.\n\nTheir teacher assured them they were correct: \"You guys are so smart!\"\n\nOne lesson, Hafner told the Free Press, isn't enough for the young children to understand how an eclipse works. But she said after many more, that likely will include books, globes and flashlights, some will.\n\nIf nothing else, they will remember wearing the glasses for a long time.\n\nEverything in motion\n\nAn eclipse — Miss Madilyn's students soon will learn — requires a precise alignment of three celestial bodies, which, like the young kids and everything else in the universe, are in constant motion.\n\nThe Earth is spinning on its axis. The moon rotates around the Earth. Both the Earth and the moon are going around the sun, which is just one of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nAnd the Milky Way, one galaxy, among a couple trillion, is zooming through the universe.\n\nIt's a humbling concept.\n\nThe last time a total solar eclipse crossed near Luna Pier was more than 200 years ago, in 1806, before Michigan was even a state. The next total eclipse to cross Michigan was in 1925. It was visible in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.\n\nBack then, the city of Luna Pier was known as Lakewood, and the pier that eventually gave the community its name was only a few years old. The Lakewood name was changed, in part, to keep the post office from confusing it with Lakewood, Ohio, and the original, straight wooden pier has been replaced with a curved concrete one.\n\nIn 1954, another total solar eclipse passed over the western part of the U.P. And in 2021, some in the state saw a partial solar eclipse — when part, but not all, of the sun is hidden.\n\nAfter April, the next total solar eclipse won’t be visible in lower Michigan until 2099.\n\nThe best in centuries\n\nEven more than being visible from Michigan, the upcoming eclipse has been touted by science publications like Space.com as potentially \"the best\" to view in hundreds of years.\n\nThe eclipse path goes through 15 states.\n\nSo if all goes just right — and there's one early, but perhaps not that reliable, weather prediction that the sky here will be clear — it will take about 2½ hours for the moon to pass in front of the sun, gradually blotting it out and then revealing it again.\n\nThe exact length of the moment in the middle of that, when the sun completely disappears, will vary from place to place.\n\nIn Luna Pier — a community that once depended on tax revenue from a coal-burning power plant before it shut down and has since turned to tourism to make up for the monetary loss — the moment will last just 26 seconds.\n\nBut in some places in North America, totality will last more than four minutes — somewhat longer than previous eclipses. During that time, you can expect the temperature to drop about 10-15 degrees and confused crickets to chirp.\n\nMore:Solar eclipse will create Purkinje effect — and red, green clothes will help you see it\n\nThis total solar eclipse, even more than the one in 2017 that bypassed Michigan, is forecast to be visible to more people, about 40 million, in contrast to 12 million seven years ago.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, there's a chance some people also may be able to see a tiny comet.\n\n\"A solar eclipse is a phenomenon, from a point of view in the cosmos, that is temporary and rare,\" Kapila Castoldi, an adjunct physics professor at Oakland University said. \"It happens on certain occasions on certain regions of the Earth, which is why, I think, people get so excited.\"\n\nThe professor added that a total eclipse is mind-boggling because, suddenly, in the middle of the day with the sun out, the sky gets progressively darker until it’s like it's nighttime.\n\nAnd that's why, scientists theorize, the crickets start chirping and birds stop singing.\n\n'Inflamed with wrath'\n\nStill, before people around the world used science to explain lunar and solar eclipses, they told stories. Some myths personified the sun and moon, representing them as a man and a woman — and sometimes even as lovers.\n\nIn folklore, the eclipses were supernatural signs.\n\nThe ancient Greeks interpreted an eclipse to mean the gods were angry and threatening to desert humanity. The modern word, eclipse, even comes from Greek, \"to abandon.\"\n\nIn a solar eclipse, the moon, which is the smallest of the three bodies, comes between the Earth and sun. In a lunar eclipse, which scientists calculate is more common than a solar one, the Earth comes between the sun and moon.\n\nThey are illusions, really.\n\nBut in 1504, only some people understood that.\n\nDuring Christopher Columbus’ last voyage to the New World, the European explorer became stranded in Jamaica with his crew for months. To survive, they exploited their knowledge of a lunar eclipse to manipulate the indigenous people.\n\nThe local people brought the crew food, but when they decided to stop, Columbus used an almanac that predicted an eclipse was coming and frightened them into doing what he wanted.\n\nColumbus declared that God was angry and would make the moon appear \"inflamed with wrath.\" The indigenous people, who then witnessed the eclipse, agreed to Columbus' demands.\n\nWhen the moon reappeared, Columbus told them God had forgiven them.\n\nMark Twain used a similar story as a key plot device in \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court,\" which was published in 1889. In the novel, the time-traveling Yankee saves himself from being burned at the stake by predicting a solar eclipse.\n\nA special place\n\nAnd that brings us back to Michigan’s Luna Pier, where Michelle and Jesse Griffin, 38 and 41, are ready with their glasses. They are planning to take the day off to watch the sun momentarily vanish.\n\nJesse Griffin said he’s not quite as excited about the eclipse as his wife, who follows astrology. He isn't as convinced the planetary movements determine his destiny, nor does he believe that they are the result of divine intervention.\n\nBut, he said, he is eager to witness the eclipse because it will be \"kinda cool.\"\n\nThe city’s library, formally known as the Rasey Memorial Branch, has been helping answer questions from fascinated children — and adults — who often ride their bikes or walk there to satisfy their curiosity and get help with homework.\n\nBecky Poca, a library clerk, said when people want to know more about the science behind the phenomenon, she directs them to books and internet videos.\n\nThe library, which opened in 1935 with 163 books, is now in the former summer home of Mr. and Mrs. James Rasey, which was donated by their daughter after they died. It is part of the Monroe County Library system with a collection that has grown to about 6,000 volumes.\n\nThe Luna Pier branch plans to give away a limited number of eclipse-viewing glasses.\n\nPoca said she just wants everyone to be able to enjoy the eclipse.\n\nAnd so does the city's mayor.\n\n\"I have a friend who saw a total eclipse in Tennessee\" in 2017, Gardner said, adding that in his 65 years he has never witnessed one. His buddy told him \"it was the most spectacular thing he’s ever seen.\"\n\nGardner said he has been eager to watch one ever since then.\n\nThe mayor acknowledged that while a few neighboring communities, which also will be in the path of totality, may offer people a chance to see the eclipse, and where perhaps the time the sky goes dark for even longer, but they don’t have a pier — or a beach.\n\nLuna Pier also is his home.\n\nGardner explained that while he was born in the U.P., he has lived there for decades. In addition, his father lived in the city and so did his grandfather, which, using one of his best dad-jokes, means he \"got grandfathered in.\"\n\nThe upcoming eclipse, the mayor said, will add to the city's history.\n\n\"I expect for a lot of people — when stories like yours come out and it gets closer — this will be way bigger than they anticipated,\" Gardner told the Free Press. And when Luna Pier residents actually see the eclipse, they will \"be blown away.\"\n\nFree Press reporters Amelia Benavides-Colón, Kylie Martin, Jenna Prestininzi, Tanya Wildt and special correspondent Max Maybee contributed.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/27/total-solar-eclipse-2024-path-totality/72354791007/", "title": "Total solar eclipse 2024 path of totality: What states can see it", "text": "Monday is your last shot of witnessing a total solar eclipse in North America for 20 years.

For the 2024 eclipse, the corona will be brighter, the moon will appear larger and totality will last just a bit longer than it did seven years ago.\n\nWhat U.S. cities and states are on the path of totality?\n\nThe 115-mile-wide eclipse will provide millions of spectators with a front row seat to its majesty as it passes through Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of cities and small towns fall directly on the path of totality. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path this year, compared to just 12 million in 2017, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nHere are some of the major cities in each of the 13 states:\n\nDallas and San Antonio, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nIndianapolis and Evansville, Indiana\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nCleveland and Toledo, Ohio\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says. In the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nWhat time will totality occur in the United States?\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality in the United States (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nDid the path of totality change?\n\nA new map from an amateur astronomer is projecting that the path of totality for Monday's solar eclipse may be narrower than experts previously believed.\n\nIf it's correct, some places, including several cities in Ohio, may now miss out on totality, while other places, including some additional cities in Texas, may now experience it.\n\nBut even if the new calculation is more accurate, it’ll likely be such a miniscule difference that it's unlikely to matter much for most of the millions of people who hope to witness the eclipse.\n\nIn fact, a NASA spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that the U.S. space agency won't be making any alterations to its own calculations.\n\nDo you need eclipse glasses during totality?\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Residents of Luna Pier, right on Lake Erie, are excited. The head of astronomy at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, Michael Narlock, said the rest of the state will get about 98% sun coverage.\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will begin at 1:58 p.m. and reach maximum totality, or coverage, around 3:14 p.m. in Detroit and southeast Michigan. It will conclude with a final partial eclipse at 4:27 p.m.\n\nThis year’s total eclipse will last longer than the one viewed by more than 20 million people in August 2017, and according to NASA won’t happen again for another 20 years. Fifteen total solar eclipses have been recorded in the U.S. in the last 150 years, with the next one expected in August 2044.\n\nHere's what you need to know and how to prepare for the 2024 total eclipse.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nSolar eclipses occur when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth’s orbits, creating an eclipse of Earth’s view of the sun.\n\nThe path of totality is the predicted path of the eclipse from Mexico, through the U.S. across Texas and North America to the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The expected duration of totality is around 4 hours, starting around 11:07 a.m. PDT and ending around 5:16 NDT.\n\nStates in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse include Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nMore:Delta adds flight to Detroit that'll let you view the 2024 solar eclipse from the sky\n\nHow to safely watch the 2024 eclipse\n\nLooking directly into a total eclipse can be damaging to the human eye, Narlock said.\n\n\"Ultraviolet light can damage your eyes,\" Narlock said. \"You can find glasses that purport to be safe, and while they may cut down the intensity of visible light from the sun, rarely do they cut UV light.\"\n\nNarlock said the only safe \"eclipse glasses\" meet the ISO 12312-2 safety standard. This means attempting to DIY a pair could prove harmful and ineffective.\n\n\"What you could do at home (instead), and relatively easy, is make a pinhole camera or projector,\" Narlock said. \"Using such a technique you can view the Sun indirectly and safely.\"\n\nHow to find 2024 solar eclipse glasses\n\nAccording to NASA's eclipse safety website, the agency does not recommend specific eyewear for eclipse viewing but does recommend glasses that come with an IOS compliance label, or standard, of 12312-2, on the packaging. The eyewear may also be labeled IOS 12312-2:2015. According to NASA, torn, scratched, or otherwise damaged eyewear should be discarded.\n\nWhile local hardware and big box retailers may have eclipse eyewear on their shelves, buyer beware, especially if they claim to be endorsed by NASA. NASA does not make specific recommendations.\n\nThe American Astronomical Society has a list of approved solar-eclipse glasses suppliers here. You'll be able to find eclipse glasses on Amazon in bulk; just ensure they are approved before you buy them.\n\nYou also may be able to find free eclipse glasses at your local public library in Michigan, along with special programs. Check your local library for details.\n\nFor more information about eclipse safety, go to the American Astronomical Society's website or to NASA.\n\nWhere can I view the eclipse from Michigan?\n\nMichigan doesn't fall in the line of totality, but the southeast corner of the state, in Monroe County, is along the edge of the path. This means the area will likely dim and temperatures drop a few degrees as the moon's shadow covers the sun.\n\nHere's when you can expect to view the eclipse from your city or area.\n\nClick the cities on the map to see the percentage of totality and the start time in each community.\n\nFree Press reporter Jennifer Dixon and USA TODAY contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/02/28/total-eclipse-2024-path/72757942007/", "title": "What is the path of the 2024 total solar eclipse?

Here's where you can plan to watch in Delaware\n\nStages of a total solar eclipse\n\nMany people focus on the moment of totality when they think of a total solar eclipse, but there are actually several distinct stages of the event that those observing can keep an eye out for.\n\nHere are the phases of a total solar eclipse, most of which Delawareans can look forward to, according to NASA:\n\nDuring a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover the sun at first, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape. When the moon first touches the sun, it is also called the “first contact.”\n\nShadow bands are long, dark, rapidly moving bands separated by white spaces that can be seen on the ground or on the sides of buildings just before or after totality.\n\nBaily’s beads are the several points of light that shine around the moon’s edges as it continues to move across the sun. They are caused by light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon’s horizon. Baily’s Beads appear for only a short amount of time and may not be noticeable to everyone watching the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe diamond ring effect occurs at the beginning and end of totality during a total solar eclipse. As Baily’s beads begin to disappear, and the last bits of sunlight pass through the valleys on the moon’s limb, the faint corona around the sun is just becoming visible along the edge of the moon’s shadow and looks like a ring with shining diamonds on it.\n\nTotality occurs once the diamond ring disappears and there is no longer any direct sunlight, also known as “second contact.” At this point, eclipse viewers may be able to see the chromosphere — a region of the solar atmosphere that appears as the thin circle of pink around the moon — and the corona, appearing as streams of white light.\n\nAs the moon continues to move across the sun, brightening will appear on the opposite side from where the diamond ring appeared at the beginning. This is the lower atmosphere of the sun beginning to peek out from behind the moon. Your eclipse glasses must be on before the first flash of sunlight appears around the edges of the moon, known as “third contact.”\n\nAs the final stages of the eclipse commence, the beginning process you just witnessed will be mirrored. The diamond ring will appear first, followed by Bailey’s beads and the shadow bands before the entire sun is visible again. “Fourth contact” is the moment that none of the sun is covered by the moon’s shadow and signals the end of the eclipse.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nMillions of Americans will be looking to the sky during a rare total solar eclipse on April 8, and experts warn the excitement could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions as people pack into the narrow band of the country with the best view.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally, people will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokesperson for the American Automobile Association.\n\nRoads could be especially packed at the center of the eclipse's path as Americans who want the best view crowd into cities, towns and remote areas, many without the infrastructure to handle big crowds.\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse, where congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after the totality of the eclipse, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests that the worst of the traffic – both on big interstates and rural backroads – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to exit all at once.\n\nThis year, in Ohio's Lorain County, county officials are warning residents to be aware about the increase in visitors, traffic and jammed roads – and possible cellphone signal drops.\n\n“What we could have is crowds here that we’re not used to,” wrote Dave Freeman, the director of Lorain County Emergency Management. “We’re not set up infrastructure-wise for that, we don’t have the roads.”\n\nEclipse forecast:Will the 2024 eclipse still look good if it's cloudy? What to know about cloud forecasts.\n\nWhere will traffic be the worst during 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nRoads in states where sky gazers will travel to see the centerline of totality will be most prone to traffic jams.\n\nEven though Oklahoma only has a small corner of the state in the path of totality, the state \"is expected to receive an influx of anywhere from 17,000 to 66,000 visitors to watch the solar eclipse,\" reads an announcement from Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Officials there are warning residents \"the large influx of visitors to southeastern Oklahoma could overwhelm and backup the area's road systems,\" including two-lane highways passing through small towns.\n\nThey advise residents to expect hotels and visiting areas at maximum capacity, increased traffic and delays in deliveries.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse snarled US traffic\n\nWyoming Department of Transportation spokesman Doug McGee said more than 536,000 cars filled the state's streets after the eclipse in 2017 and the state highway system \"was taxed like it’s never been before,\" The Denver Post reported.\n\nAnd \"travel from Casper, Wyoming, to Denver, Colorado – normally a 4-hour trip – took 10 hours or more,\" according to an analysis of traffic from Transportation Research News.\n\nThe analysis' author Jonathan Upchurch said most sky gazers traveled to the paths of totality by car, \"roadways experienced very little traffic congestion on the days leading up to totality\" and \"almost every Interstate route passing through the path of totality showed red on Google Traffic maps\" after the eclipse reached totality.\n\nThe 2017 traffic woes followed warnings from officials.\n\nBe careful if you're driving during the eclipse\n\nTexas state officials are also warning drivers to \"be on alert for distracted pedestrians looking to the sky.\" They also say drivers should not wear eclipse glasses, which block out most light, while driving.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?Search your ZIP code for a viewing guide\n\nOfficials there and elsewhere along the solar eclipse's line of totality are recommending drivers keep their headlights on, be mindful of pedestrians on the road and even stock up on essentials like fuel and food ahead of the eclipse.\n\nAAA, which insures drivers across the country, is also warning people that sky gazers looking for a good view of the eclipse will be on the roads. They recommend drivers put their sun visors in their cars down to block their view of the sun and watch closely for pedestrian traffic.\n\nHow should Americans prepare for traffic jams?\n\nAAA and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol suggest several ways Americans can prepare for traffic jams related to the solar eclipse:\n\nPlan ahead so you don't have to travel for errands or appointments around when the eclipse is happening.\n\nDon't pull over on the side of a road or highway to view the eclipse. Find a parking area instead.\n\nFuel up before the eclipse and have some essentials on hand while traveling.\n\nWhen and where can you view the 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light, leading to a period of partial or full darkness on Earth.\n\nThe path of totality, where the sun is fully blocked, in the U.S. begins in Texas and the eclipse starts around 1:27 p.m. local time.\n\nCities on the centerline of the April 8 eclipse include Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nContributing: Ashley May, Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla and Ahjané Forbes, USA TODAY\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

This event is huge because there won't be another in the United States until 2044.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure everyone knows the facts about eclipses, because there are crazy myths floating around that have been debunked. We also share where to buy the appropriate eclipse glasses.\n\nPregnant women shouldn't watch an eclipse since it could hurt the baby\n\nThere's a false idea out there that harmful radiation is released from an eclipse, which has been debunked by NASA.\n\nGreg Weaver, manager of Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory in Hockessin, said this myth makes no sense.\n\n\"It's like saying, 'If you're pregnant, you shouldn't go out in the sun, because you might get a sunburn and it might hurt your pregnant child.' That's crazy,\" he explained.\n\nAn eclipse is a bad omen\n\nWhile an eclipse can seem eerie, they're not a sign of bad luck.\n\nWeaver said that superstition may stem from around 900 A.D. when ancient civilizations such as the Mayans used to accurately predict eclipses. They understood what are called the SAROS cycles, which are periods of the moon going around the earth.\n\n\"If you were like an astronomer and you failed to predict an eclipse, that was a death sentence, because that was your job,\" Weaver explained.\n\nNASA says the idea of eclipses being tied to bad omens is a classic case of \"confirmation basis,\" in which psychologists say we tend to remember moments when two things happened together but forget when they don't.\n\nOne example NASA gives is that King Henry I of England died in A.D. 1133, an event that coincided with a total solar eclipse.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can't happen at North or South Pole\n\nThe last total solar eclipse seen from the North Pole area was on March 20, 2015 and it passed over the North Pole itself and it came to an end exactly at the Spring Equinox, per NASA. The last total solar eclipse seen from the South Pole area was on Nov. 23, 2003.\n\nWeaver said a total solar eclipse is once again slated to pass over the North Pole area on Aug. 12, 2026 and will pass through parts of Iceland, Greenland and Siberia. In 2039, a total solar eclipse is headed to the South Pole and will pass over Antarctica, he added.\n\n\"They can happen anywhere,\" Weaver said about eclipses.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can make you blind\n\nYour eyes won't get damaged if you're in the direct path of a total eclipse and you're not wearing solar glasses during that phase because the sky will be too dark to see it, said Weaver, who is traveling to Indiana to witness the total eclipse on April 8, since Delaware will only experience a partial phase of the solar event.\n\nAt all other phases of a solar eclipse, proper precautions to protect your eyes from damage are needed.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' reports NASA on its website.\n\nSo why didn't Donald Trump go blind when he looked at the eclipse?\n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency in 2017, the internet buzzed when he observed a partial phase of a total eclipse from the White House balcony without protective glasses. Many questioned why he didn't suffer blindness from looking at the sun directly.\n\nWeaver said the answer is simple.\n\n\"It's just like looking at the sun on a sunny day. Try staring at the sun. You can't. Your blink reflexes will shut your eyes because it'll damage your eyes,\" explained Weaver, who traveled with his wife to Tennessee in 2017 to get a better view of the total eclipse.\n\nTo the Mt. Cuba expert's point, Trump squinted at the sun twice for a grand total of less than 2 seconds, before wearing his protective glasses.\n\nBut don't try this at home, kids. Experts advise that you keep your vision intact by using precautions such as eclipse glasses throughout the event.\n\n\"There's no word from the White House about whether Trump suffered eye damage, but he appeared to look up for only a brief moment,'' say the folks at Space.com. \"If you plan to look at the sun during an eclipse or at any other time, make sure you put on a pair of protective glasses or use a pinhole projector.''\n\nWill I need solar glasses for the total eclipse?\n\nMost people around the country will need to wear special eye protection to view the eclipse since most won't be in the path of totality, which is when the moon completely blocks the sun's bright face, NASA says.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' experts warn on the website.\n\nDelawareans will experience a partial eclipse, and this means the sun will be too bright to look at directly without using appropriate eye protection.\n\nEclipse glasses aren't regular sunglasses since they're \"thousands of times darker and ought to comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard,\" NASA says.\n\n\"Viewing any part of the bright Sun through a camera lens, binoculars, or a telescope without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics will instantly cause severe eye injury.''\n\nWhere can I buy eclipse glasses?\n\nWhile NASA reported it \"does not approve any particular brand of solar glasses,\" its website does link to the American Astronomical Society's website.\n\nThe AAS said several \"counterfeit eclipse glasses\" flooded the marketplace during the 2017 eclipse. In response to that, the AAS has a list of reputable sellers at eclipse.aas.org that people can vet.\n\nIn addition, the AAS says it doesn't recommend searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu, or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price. Instead, they recommend that people make sure that (1) the seller is identified on their AAS site and (2) the seller is listed on their page.\n\nWanna see the solar eclipse in Delaware?Here's where to check it out\n\nWant a better view of the solar eclipse?These places are good to see it out of state\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total eclipse in the US is Monday, April 8.\n\nIn Delaware:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible.

Fortunately, the path of totality in the U.S. crosses from the bottom of Texas all the way to the tip of Maine, giving many Americans a good chance of finding a place within a reasonable distance to skygaze.\n\nEven those who find themselves in a location in the continental United States outside the eclipse's direct path are likely to witness the stunning celestial event in some form. But when it comes to experiencing a total solar eclipse as rare and grandiose as the one days away, there's no doubt about it: The path of totality is the place to be.\n\nHere's what to know about the 2024 total solar eclipse's path of totality, including the times and durations when darkness is expected to fall.\n\nSolar eclipse experiment:Here's why NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse\n\nWhat is the path of totality?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in 2017. But astronomers say there won't be any comparison between that eclipse and the one coming Monday. For the 2024 eclipse, the corona will be brighter, the moon will appear larger and totality will last just a bit longer than it did seven years ago.\n\nWhat U.S. cities and states are on the path of totality?\n\nThe 115-mile-wide eclipse will provide millions of spectators with a front row seat to its majesty as it passes through Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of cities and small towns fall directly on the path of totality. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path this year, compared to just 12 million in 2017, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nHere are some of the major cities in each of the 13 states:\n\nDallas and San Antonio, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nIndianapolis and Evansville, Indiana\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nCleveland and Toledo, Ohio\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says. In the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nWhat time will totality occur in the United States?\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas.

From diving with sharks on Australia's Coral Coast to rafting the white rapids of West Virginia, National Geographic has some unique ideas for you with its annual Best of the World 2024 list.\n\nThe list, released first to USA TODAY on Tuesday, includes top destinations in the world and lesser-known ones. They range from Paris and Niagara Falls to the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia and archeological sites on the Spanish island of Menorca.\n\nUnlike previous years, National Geographic is emphasizing must-do experiences at each destination, instead of just listing out locations. And in another step away from previous editions, the publication has added rankings to help readers prioritize their bucket list.\n\n\"I'm so excited about this,\" said National Geographic Editor-in-Chief Nathan Lump at an exclusive preview in New York last week. \"We've really extended it to be bigger than ever before. And we just think that is a really, really great way to serve our travelers who are looking for great ideas all the time.\"\n\nLump said the list was being released on Tuesday to coincide with National Vacation Day, the last Tuesday of every January.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nMillions of vacation days go to waste every year, and Lump said that he hopes that this year's list will inspire readers to get out of their comfort zone and explore the world.\n\nThe list of the top 20 travel experiences is curated by National Geographic explorers, photographers, and editors. It's “a celebration” of “travel’s power to transform us and our connections with one another,\" the magazine said.\n\nWhat are the best places to visit/experience in 2024?\n\nNational Geographic’s top travel experiences for the year are:\n\nHorseback safari in Kenya. Olympic Marathon in Paris. Ski tour through UNESCO sites in Georgia. Bear-watching at Katmai National Park, Alaska. Live music in Kyoto, Japan. Magdalena River Cruise in Colombia. Road trip on Route 66 in New Mexico. Explore ancient rock art in Algeria. Dive with sharks on Australia's Coral Coast. Volcano hiking in Panama. Observe the total solar eclipse in Niagara Falls, New York. Trek a glacier in Chile. Step back in time at Menorca's archaeological sites. Ride classic rails through the Scottish Highlands. Indulge your taste buds in Isan, Thailand. Wander the tea trail in Sri Lanka. Gallery hop in Sao Paulo. Raft the rapids in West Virginia. Go antiquing in the Hudson Valley, New York. Sleep at a floating lodge on Tofino Island, British Columbia.\n\nHow did National Geographic decide these places?\n\nPutting together and consolidating a list of places is no easy feat but Amy Alipio, senior editor at National Geographic, told USA TODAY that it's her favorite project every year.\n\nTo put together the list, Alipio explained that her team taps into their global network of experts around the world. While work on the list is an ongoing process, National Geographic sends an official call out to its global network in April, said Alipio, who has been heading the list since its inception 12 years ago.\n\n“We asked them, ‘What places do you love? What have you seen or done lately that you were absolutely blown away by or where do you want to go next?’” she said.\n\nThis year they also asked their experts to share what exactly they would do in those locations and that made the list even more personal, Alipio said.\n\n“We're not just mentioning places,\" said Alipio. \"We're mentioning where to go, but (also) what to do once you're there. I think we're really pinpointing ways people can connect and immerse themselves in a destination.”\n\nRanking the list\n\nThis is the first time that National Geographic has ranked it's \"Best of the World\" list to give readers an insight into what is trending and timely.\n\n\"For example, like the horseback safari (in Kenya), – just because people are really into slow travel,\" she said. \"But also our No. 2 experience is really timely. It's about the Paris Olympics, which are this summer.\"\n\n\"I think it really was kind of like a mixture of superlative and timeliness,\" she adds.\n\nThe rankings have also been added as a response to audience feedback that they needed help prioritizing their travel plans.\n\n\"People do ask us like, 'What's the No. 1 thing on this list?'\" Alipio said. \"And now this year, we finally can tell people, 'Yeah, well, actually, we do have a number one that we really like.'\"\n\nWhat US sites made National Geographic's 'Best of the World 2024' list?\n\nThe following U.S. destinations made National Geographic's list this year: Katmai National Park in Alaska, Route 66 in New Mexico, Niagara Falls and the Hudson Valley in New York and West Virginia’s New River.\n\nNational Geographic recommends bear-watching at the Alaska national park along the Pacific Coast, which has the highest concentration of brown bears in the world. However, the publication suggests ditching the popular Brooks Camp visitor center and taking a trip through areas like Hallo Bay and Geographic Harbor. This activity is among the top five activities suggested by National Geographic.\n\nNational Geographic also recommends road-tripping on Route 66 through New Mexico, catching the total solar eclipse on April 8 at Terrapin Point in Niagara Falls State Park, antiquing in New York's Hudson Valley and rafting through the rapids in West Virginia's New River.\n\nWhere to see it:2024's total solar eclipse will pass through over a dozen states\n\nJust go to this Alaskan national park:You don't need to fly to Norway to view fjords.\n\nBest places to visit in South and Central America\n\nColombia, Chile and Brazil in South America are among the best places to visit in 2024, while Panama is the best place to visit in Central America, according to National Geographic.\n\nNational Geographic recommends taking a cruise on Columbia's Magdalena River, soaking in the natural beauty and culture through the colonial towns and floating villages that surround the river.\n\nBrazil's largest city, São Paulo, is an art-lovers paradise, and travelers can gallery-hop through the city's numerous galleries and art exhibitions, browse renowned street art, and check out the Museu de Arte de São Paulo, which holds more than 11,000 artworks from around the world.\n\nIn Chile, National Geographic suggests trekking through Patagonia’s Northern and Southern Ice Fields glaciers before they completely succumb to rising temperatures and climate change.\n\nIf you're into sustainable tourism, National Geographic recommends exploring Panama, which is currently promoting a government-supported community tourism network that allows travelers to select trips that \"provide immersive experiences in less-visited areas of the country.\"\n\nAmong the highlights is the Ruta de la Caldera, a system of five hiking trails around the extinct El Valle de Antón volcano.\n\nBest places to visit in Africa\n\nThe No. 1 destination on National Geographic's list is in Africa. Going on a horseback safari in the Borana Conservancy, a 32,000-acre preserve in northern Kenya, is the top thing to do this year, says the publication.\n\n“To journey on horseback is to break down the walls – meant to protect, but also to separate – between oneself and the natural world,” Nichole Sobecki, a photographer and lifelong equestrian, said in a statement provided by National Geographic. “Your horse is your guide, and translator, responding to the low growl of the lion, the soft scent of a herd of elephants, the cool morning breeze descending from Mount Kenya’s glacial peaks.\"\n\nThe North African state of Algeria is also on National Geographic's list, ranking at No. 8. Algeria is home to Africa’s largest national park and holds one of the world’s greatest concentrations of ancient rock art, according to National Geographic. Tassili N'Ajjer National Park, also a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a \"geologic wonderland of sandstone pinnacles and arches surrounded by orange dunes,\" says the publication.\n\nBest places to visit in Europe/UK\n\nAmong National Geographic's best places to visit in Europe and the United Kingdom in 2024 are Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Menorca in the Mediterranean Sea for a taste of history and the Scottish Highlands for a luxury train trip.\n\nWhile Paris is a bucket list location, National Geographic recommends traveling there for the Summer Olympics and participating in the Olympic marathon course. Twenty thousand regular runners will be allowed to run the 26.2-mile loop that links Paris and Versailles, beginning at the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and passing through nine districts before finishing at Les Invalides on the banks of the Seine.\n\n\"Amateur athletes will be able to run the same route as the Olympic marathon, by night, enabling as many people as possible to follow in the footsteps of outstanding athletes,\" according to the race website. \"This will be an extraordinary experience, on a unique and original route, celebrating the heritage and history of the Paris region and the whole of France.\"\n\nBest places to visit in Asia\n\nAmong National Geographic's top recommendations for Asia in 2024 are: Kyoto in Japan, Isan in Thailand, the Caucasus Mountains in Georgia – which is located in both west Asia and Eastern Europe – and the newly opened Pekoe tea Trail in Sri Lanka.\n\n\"Carving a path through cloud-swathed villages and centuries-old tea estates, the new long-distance Pekoe Trail gives hikers a chance to explore Sri Lanka’s quiet central highlands,\" National Geographic writes.\n\nBest places to visit in Australia\n\nThe Coral Coast, stretching almost 700 miles along the Indian Ocean north of Perth, is one of National Geographic's top recommended spots for 2024. Underwater activities include exploring the world’s largest fringing reef, Ningaloo Reef, \"a stunning counterpart to the over-touristed Great Barrier Reef,\" and swimming with dolphins, whale sharks, and manta rays.\n\nBetween July and October, some 40,000 humpback whales migrate down the Australian coast, allowing travelers to observe them up close.\n\nInterestingly, both National Geographic editors, Lump and Alipio, are looking forward to a deep-water adventure at Australia's Coral Coast.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

A detailed look at the ...", "text": "Monday is your last shot of witnessing a total solar eclipse in North America for 20 years. Fortunately, the path of totality in the U.S. crosses from the bottom of Texas all the way to the tip of Maine, giving many Americans a good chance of finding a place within a reasonable distance to skygaze.\n\nEven those who find themselves in a location in the continental United States outside the eclipse's direct path are likely to witness the stunning celestial event in some form. But when it comes to experiencing a total solar eclipse as rare and grandiose as the one days away, there's no doubt about it: The path of totality is the place to be.\n\nHere's what to know about the 2024 total solar eclipse's path of totality, including the times and durations when darkness is expected to fall.\n\nSolar eclipse experiment:Here's why NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse\n\nWhat is the path of totality?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in 2017. But astronomers say there won't be any comparison between that eclipse and the one coming Monday. For the 2024 eclipse, the corona will be brighter, the moon will appear larger and totality will last just a bit longer than it did seven years ago.\n\nWhat U.S. cities and states are on the path of totality?\n\nThe 115-mile-wide eclipse will provide millions of spectators with a front row seat to its majesty as it passes through Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of cities and small towns fall directly on the path of totality. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path this year, compared to just 12 million in 2017, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nHere are some of the major cities in each of the 13 states:\n\nDallas and San Antonio, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nIndianapolis and Evansville, Indiana\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nCleveland and Toledo, Ohio\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says.

Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun’s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun.\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total solar eclipse is on Monday, April 8.\n\nThe duration of totality will last four minutes and 27 seconds, nearly double that of the total solar eclipse seen in the United States in 2017, according to Great American Eclipse.\n\nAlthough the next total solar eclipse will be visible elsewhere on Aug. 12, 2026, if you miss out on April 8, the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous U.S. won’t arrive until Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nWhat time will the total solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe path of totality — when the moon completely covers the sun, creating a total eclipse — runs from Mexico (Sinaloa to Coahuila) to the United States (Texas to Maine) to Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland), according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nThe following U.S. cities are in the path of totality, according to NASA:\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nEvansville, Indiana\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nAreas near these cities will experience a partial eclipse before and after the time totality is expected. A partial eclipse will be visible across nearly all of the U.S. and a small portion of western Europe.\n\nGlobal eclipse events will occur at the following local times:\n\nPartial eclipse will first be visible at 11:42 a.m.\n\nFull eclipse will first be visible at 12:38 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse will be visible at 2:17 p.m.\n\nFull eclipse will last be visible at 3:55 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse will last be visible at 4:52 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43,800,000 people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible. As for any part of the eclipse, not just totality, 8.19% of the population, or 652,000,000 people, will be able to tune in, according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nEclipse trip:Want to head out of town for a better view of the April solar eclipse? Here's where to go\n\nWhat will Delaware see during the eclipse?\n\nDelaware is not in the path of totality, so only a partial eclipse will be seen in the Small Wonder.\n\nEclipse action in Delaware will take place at the following times:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nEclipse viewing:The total solar eclipse will be here soon. Here's where you can plan to watch in Delaware\n\nStages of a total solar eclipse\n\nMany people focus on the moment of totality when they think of a total solar eclipse, but there are actually several distinct stages of the event that those observing can keep an eye out for.\n\nHere are the phases of a total solar eclipse, most of which Delawareans can look forward to, according to NASA:\n\nDuring a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover the sun at first, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape. When the moon first touches the sun, it is also called the “first contact.”\n\nShadow bands are long, dark, rapidly moving bands separated by white spaces that can be seen on the ground or on the sides of buildings just before or after totality.\n\nBaily’s beads are the several points of light that shine around the moon’s edges as it continues to move across the sun. They are caused by light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon’s horizon. Baily’s Beads appear for only a short amount of time and may not be noticeable to everyone watching the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe diamond ring effect occurs at the beginning and end of totality during a total solar eclipse. As Baily’s beads begin to disappear, and the last bits of sunlight pass through the valleys on the moon’s limb, the faint corona around the sun is just becoming visible along the edge of the moon’s shadow and looks like a ring with shining diamonds on it.\n\nTotality occurs once the diamond ring disappears and there is no longer any direct sunlight, also known as “second contact.” At this point, eclipse viewers may be able to see the chromosphere — a region of the solar atmosphere that appears as the thin circle of pink around the moon — and the corona, appearing as streams of white light.\n\nAs the moon continues to move across the sun, brightening will appear on the opposite side from where the diamond ring appeared at the beginning. This is the lower atmosphere of the sun beginning to peek out from behind the moon. Your eclipse glasses must be on before the first flash of sunlight appears around the edges of the moon, known as “third contact.”\n\nAs the final stages of the eclipse commence, the beginning process you just witnessed will be mirrored. The diamond ring will appear first, followed by Bailey’s beads and the shadow bands before the entire sun is visible again. “Fourth contact” is the moment that none of the sun is covered by the moon’s shadow and signals the end of the eclipse.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Kamin Science Center\n\nBecause of where that Line of Totality falls, \"There's a big distinction between what people in Beaver County or Allegheny County will see compared to cities like Cleveland,\" Iwaniec said.\n\nShe's heard a scientist make the comparison that being within the Line of Totality is like having a VIP pass to Disney World, while not being within that range would be like hanging out in the Disney World parking lot.\n\nThe skies will look less dim above the Beaver Valley, \"but it will just be a really cool, partial solar eclipse,\" Iwaniec said.\n\nThe recently renamed Kamin Science Center (formerly the Carnegie Science Center) on Pittsburgh's North Shore will host an eclipse viewing party with live stream coverage from Totality areas and other educational programming.\n\n\"A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun,\" according to NASA. \"The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.\"\n\nNASA says, \"Safety is the No. 1 priority when viewing a total solar eclipse.

The outdoor, family-friendly event will feature hands-on science activities, a free community concert performance by The Cleveland Orchestra on April 7, food vendors, entertainment, NASA experts engaged with the public and free eclipse viewing glasses (while supplies last).\n\nNorthwest Pennsylvania and Cleveland area wineries and craft breweries already are advertising their eclipse viewing parties.\n\nThe Venango County city Franklin will be in the path of totality and is planning a Solar Eclipse of the Heart Wellness Festival on April 8.\n\nKamin Science Center soon will announce its eclipse party programming.\n\n\"We hope people are able to make it out to learn more about the solar eclipse and join us in a celebration for this cool phenomenon,\" Iwaniec said.\n\nThe next solar eclipse above the U.S. won't take place for another 20 years, Aug. 23, 2044, above Montana and parts of the Dakotas.\n\nIwaniec said there's heightened interest in the April eclipse because the Line of Totality covers an area with large populations, not above, say, some remote part of Wyoming.\n\nA 2026 solar eclipse is set for Greenland, and a 2027 solar eclipse will be above Egypt.\n\n\"But this one's literally in our backyard,\" Iwaniec said.\n\nAnd the buzz is growing.\n\nEven in a partial viewership area, Raccoon Creek State Park in Hanover Township anticipates \"extremely high visitor use that day\" from people eager to experience the eclipse, said Emily Borcz, program assistant for the state Department of Conservation & Natural Resources.\n\nBeaver County-ites can get a taste of the eclipse from their backyards.\n\nThough if you compared that taste to wine, \"Beaver Valley will taste like Ripple, and north of I-80 will taste like the best vintage ever made,\" Marzano said.\n\nMore:Pittsburgh's Heinz History Center nominated as 'Best History Museum' by USA Today\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at the Beaver County Times and easy to reach at stady@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/13/solar-eclipse-myths-debunked-by-nasa-before-april-8-solar-event/72837565007/", "title": "Eclipse myths busted by NASA, other experts as Delaware ...", "text": "From ancient civilizations predicting celestial events without telescopes to Donald Trump gazing at the sun with his naked eyes, humanity's fascination with solar eclipses spans many generations.\n\nExcitement peaks in the United States as the next total solar eclipse is Monday, April 8, the first since 2017. This event is huge because there won't be another in the United States until 2044.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure everyone knows the facts about eclipses, because there are crazy myths floating around that have been debunked. We also share where to buy the appropriate eclipse glasses.\n\nPregnant women shouldn't watch an eclipse since it could hurt the baby\n\nThere's a false idea out there that harmful radiation is released from an eclipse, which has been debunked by NASA.\n\nGreg Weaver, manager of Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory in Hockessin, said this myth makes no sense.\n\n\"It's like saying, 'If you're pregnant, you shouldn't go out in the sun, because you might get a sunburn and it might hurt your pregnant child.' That's crazy,\" he explained.\n\nAn eclipse is a bad omen\n\nWhile an eclipse can seem eerie, they're not a sign of bad luck.\n\nWeaver said that superstition may stem from around 900 A.D. when ancient civilizations such as the Mayans used to accurately predict eclipses. They understood what are called the SAROS cycles, which are periods of the moon going around the earth.\n\n\"If you were like an astronomer and you failed to predict an eclipse, that was a death sentence, because that was your job,\" Weaver explained.\n\nNASA says the idea of eclipses being tied to bad omens is a classic case of \"confirmation basis,\" in which psychologists say we tend to remember moments when two things happened together but forget when they don't.\n\nOne example NASA gives is that King Henry I of England died in A.D. 1133, an event that coincided with a total solar eclipse.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can't happen at North or South Pole\n\nThe last total solar eclipse seen from the North Pole area was on March 20, 2015 and it passed over the North Pole itself and it came to an end exactly at the Spring Equinox, per NASA. The last total solar eclipse seen from the South Pole area was on Nov. 23, 2003.\n\nWeaver said a total solar eclipse is once again slated to pass over the North Pole area on Aug. 12, 2026 and will pass through parts of Iceland, Greenland and Siberia. In 2039, a total solar eclipse is headed to the South Pole and will pass over Antarctica, he added.\n\n\"They can happen anywhere,\" Weaver said about eclipses.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can make you blind\n\nYour eyes won't get damaged if you're in the direct path of a total eclipse and you're not wearing solar glasses during that phase because the sky will be too dark to see it, said Weaver, who is traveling to Indiana to witness the total eclipse on April 8, since Delaware will only experience a partial phase of the solar event.\n\nAt all other phases of a solar eclipse, proper precautions to protect your eyes from damage are needed.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' reports NASA on its website.\n\nSo why didn't Donald Trump go blind when he looked at the eclipse?\n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency in 2017, the internet buzzed when he observed a partial phase of a total eclipse from the White House balcony without protective glasses. Many questioned why he didn't suffer blindness from looking at the sun directly.\n\nWeaver said the answer is simple.\n\n\"It's just like looking at the sun on a sunny day. Try staring at the sun. You can't. Your blink reflexes will shut your eyes because it'll damage your eyes,\" explained Weaver, who traveled with his wife to Tennessee in 2017 to get a better view of the total eclipse.\n\nTo the Mt. Cuba expert's point, Trump squinted at the sun twice for a grand total of less than 2 seconds, before wearing his protective glasses.\n\nBut don't try this at home, kids. Experts advise that you keep your vision intact by using precautions such as eclipse glasses throughout the event.\n\n\"There's no word from the White House about whether Trump suffered eye damage, but he appeared to look up for only a brief moment,'' say the folks at Space.com. \"If you plan to look at the sun during an eclipse or at any other time, make sure you put on a pair of protective glasses or use a pinhole projector.''\n\nWill I need solar glasses for the total eclipse?\n\nMost people around the country will need to wear special eye protection to view the eclipse since most won't be in the path of totality, which is when the moon completely blocks the sun's bright face, NASA says.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' experts warn on the website.\n\nDelawareans will experience a partial eclipse, and this means the sun will be too bright to look at directly without using appropriate eye protection.\n\nEclipse glasses aren't regular sunglasses since they're \"thousands of times darker and ought to comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard,\" NASA says.\n\n\"Viewing any part of the bright Sun through a camera lens, binoculars, or a telescope without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics will instantly cause severe eye injury.''\n\nWhere can I buy eclipse glasses?\n\nWhile NASA reported it \"does not approve any particular brand of solar glasses,\" its website does link to the American Astronomical Society's website.\n\nThe AAS said several \"counterfeit eclipse glasses\" flooded the marketplace during the 2017 eclipse. In response to that, the AAS has a list of reputable sellers at eclipse.aas.org that people can vet.\n\nIn addition, the AAS says it doesn't recommend searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu, or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price. Instead, they recommend that people make sure that (1) the seller is identified on their AAS site and (2) the seller is listed on their page.\n\nWanna see the solar eclipse in Delaware?Here's where to check it out\n\nWant a better view of the solar eclipse?These places are good to see it out of state\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total eclipse in the US is Monday, April 8.\n\nIn Delaware:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nMillions of Americans will be looking to the sky during a rare total solar eclipse on April 8, and experts warn the excitement could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions as people pack into the narrow band of the country with the best view.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally, people will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokesperson for the American Automobile Association.\n\nRoads could be especially packed at the center of the eclipse's path as Americans who want the best view crowd into cities, towns and remote areas, many without the infrastructure to handle big crowds.\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse, where congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after the totality of the eclipse, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests that the worst of the traffic – both on big interstates and rural backroads – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to exit all at once.\n\nThis year, in Ohio's Lorain County, county officials are warning residents to be aware about the increase in visitors, traffic and jammed roads – and possible cellphone signal drops.\n\n“What we could have is crowds here that we’re not used to,” wrote Dave Freeman, the director of Lorain County Emergency Management. “We’re not set up infrastructure-wise for that, we don’t have the roads.”\n\nEclipse forecast:Will the 2024 eclipse still look good if it's cloudy? What to know about cloud forecasts.\n\nWhere will traffic be the worst during 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nRoads in states where sky gazers will travel to see the centerline of totality will be most prone to traffic jams.\n\nEven though Oklahoma only has a small corner of the state in the path of totality, the state \"is expected to receive an influx of anywhere from 17,000 to 66,000 visitors to watch the solar eclipse,\" reads an announcement from Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Officials there are warning residents \"the large influx of visitors to southeastern Oklahoma could overwhelm and backup the area's road systems,\" including two-lane highways passing through small towns.\n\nThey advise residents to expect hotels and visiting areas at maximum capacity, increased traffic and delays in deliveries.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse snarled US traffic\n\nWyoming Department of Transportation spokesman Doug McGee said more than 536,000 cars filled the state's streets after the eclipse in 2017 and the state highway system \"was taxed like it’s never been before,\" The Denver Post reported.\n\nAnd \"travel from Casper, Wyoming, to Denver, Colorado – normally a 4-hour trip – took 10 hours or more,\" according to an analysis of traffic from Transportation Research News.\n\nThe analysis' author Jonathan Upchurch said most sky gazers traveled to the paths of totality by car, \"roadways experienced very little traffic congestion on the days leading up to totality\" and \"almost every Interstate route passing through the path of totality showed red on Google Traffic maps\" after the eclipse reached totality.\n\nThe 2017 traffic woes followed warnings from officials.\n\nBe careful if you're driving during the eclipse\n\nTexas state officials are also warning drivers to \"be on alert for distracted pedestrians looking to the sky.\" They also say drivers should not wear eclipse glasses, which block out most light, while driving.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?Search your ZIP code for a viewing guide\n\nOfficials there and elsewhere along the solar eclipse's line of totality are recommending drivers keep their headlights on, be mindful of pedestrians on the road and even stock up on essentials like fuel and food ahead of the eclipse.\n\nAAA, which insures drivers across the country, is also warning people that sky gazers looking for a good view of the eclipse will be on the roads. They recommend drivers put their sun visors in their cars down to block their view of the sun and watch closely for pedestrian traffic.\n\nHow should Americans prepare for traffic jams?\n\nAAA and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol suggest several ways Americans can prepare for traffic jams related to the solar eclipse:\n\nPlan ahead so you don't have to travel for errands or appointments around when the eclipse is happening.\n\nDon't pull over on the side of a road or highway to view the eclipse. Find a parking area instead.\n\nFuel up before the eclipse and have some essentials on hand while traveling.\n\nWhen and where can you view the 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light, leading to a period of partial or full darkness on Earth.\n\nThe path of totality, where the sun is fully blocked, in the U.S. begins in Texas and the eclipse starts around 1:27 p.m. local time.\n\nCities on the centerline of the April 8 eclipse include Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nContributing: Ashley May, Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla and Ahjané Forbes, USA TODAY\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

But astronomers say there won't be any comparison between that eclipse and the one coming Monday. For the 2024 eclipse, the corona will be brighter, the moon will appear larger and totality will last just a bit longer than it did seven years ago.\n\nWhat U.S. cities and states are on the path of totality?\n\nThe 115-mile-wide eclipse will provide millions of spectators with a front row seat to its majesty as it passes through Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of cities and small towns fall directly on the path of totality. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path this year, compared to just 12 million in 2017, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nHere are some of the major cities in each of the 13 states:\n\nDallas and San Antonio, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nIndianapolis and Evansville, Indiana\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nCleveland and Toledo, Ohio\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says. In the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nWhat time will totality occur in the United States?\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality in the United States (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nDid the path of totality change?\n\nA new map from an amateur astronomer is projecting that the path of totality for Monday's solar eclipse may be narrower than experts previously believed.\n\nIf it's correct, some places, including several cities in Ohio, may now miss out on totality, while other places, including some additional cities in Texas, may now experience it.\n\nBut even if the new calculation is more accurate, it’ll likely be such a miniscule difference that it's unlikely to matter much for most of the millions of people who hope to witness the eclipse.\n\nIn fact, a NASA spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that the U.S. space agency won't be making any alterations to its own calculations.\n\nDo you need eclipse glasses during totality?\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path this year, compared to just 12 million in 2017, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nHere are some of the major cities in each of the 13 states:\n\nDallas and San Antonio, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nIndianapolis and Evansville, Indiana\n\nCarbondale, Illinois\n\nCleveland and Toledo, Ohio\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says. In the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nWhat time will totality occur in the United States?\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality in the United States (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nDid the path of totality change?\n\nA new map from an amateur astronomer is projecting that the path of totality for Monday's solar eclipse may be narrower than experts previously believed.\n\nIf it's correct, some places, including several cities in Ohio, may now miss out on totality, while other places, including some additional cities in Texas, may now experience it.\n\nBut even if the new calculation is more accurate, it’ll likely be such a miniscule difference that it's unlikely to matter much for most of the millions of people who hope to witness the eclipse.\n\nIn fact, a NASA spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that the U.S. space agency won't be making any alterations to its own calculations.\n\nDo you need eclipse glasses during totality?\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

However, Marshall Miller and five of his friends decided to descend from the sky during totality.\n\nThe group, working with Outside TV, fell 14,000 feet above the ground in Madras, Oregon, to become the first-ever wingsuit formation through a full solar eclipse.\n\nThey jumped exactly 30 seconds before totality, to coincide with the changes in the sun.\n\nAmateur astronomer enjoys sky before, during eclipse\n\nSALEM, 2:45 p.m. — Bailey Steutzman of Salem has camped in the Southeast Salem dog park for the last two days getting ready for this event.\n\nThe amateur astronomer brought his telescope, his solar filter, a few friends and his daughter, Deanna, then prepared for the upcoming event. But the night before, he was enjoying the night sky.\n\n\"We star gazed until 4 o'clock, staring at these big masses of stars,\" Steutzman said.\n\nSteutzman slept for three hours before he woke for the eclipse, which he watched with his family and friends. Once he finished with his telescope and totality, he looked around him and watched what he called the sunset.\n\n\"Some caught mercury and Venus, but I caught the sunset, this 360 golden band through the trees,\" Steutzman said. \"It was incredible.\"\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nEclipse, baseball bring family together\n\nKEIZER – It was a collective reaction of astonishment as fans viewed Totality at Volcanoes Stadium.\n\nTotality arrived at 10:17 a.m. during the first eclipse delay in baseball history featuring the host Salem-Keizer Volcanoes vs. the Hillsboro Hops.\n\n“That was amazing,” said Chase Schechter of Wilsonville, who attended the game with her grandmother, Joan Bouchard. “I was surprised that people were coming from all over the world to see this, but now that I’ve seen it I would definitely go again.”\n\nJoan Bouchard wanted to share the historic occasion with her granddaughter.\n\n“It was very moving,” Bouchard said. “I will never be around to see another one, so this was very important to me.”\n\nThe first morning game in Volcanoes history was delayed at 10:03 a.m. and play resumed 51 minutes later in the bottom of the first inning.\n\nFans representing 34 states and eight countries were in attendance at sold-out Volcanoes Stadium.\n\n— Gary Horowitz\n\nDespite some road congestion, visitors satsified with eclipse\n\nSALEM, 1:30 p.m. — Lod Emily Conde from Tigard weren't planning to come to the eclipse, but a guide at the Oregon Observatory persuaded them.\n\n\n\n\"I asked him, 'Is it worth it?' And he said, 'yes.' So we drove down,\" Lou Conde said.\n\nThe two camped in the dog park, which was almost empty at 12:22 p.m. The remaining campers and guests have said crowds were much smaller than expected here, though the parking lot was full by morning.\n\nBikers and hikers emerged from the driveway to a hectic scene, as cars slowly nudged forward along River Road. The stretch near the park had become a makeshift parking lot, with several guests waiting patiently for cars.\n\nLisa Aziz of Los Angeles waited for her husband to retrieve her car with her two daughters, Liora and Ariela. The family drove down this morning at 5:30 a.m.\n\nCamper or day tripper, the reaction to totality was the same, said Lou Conde.\n\n\"It was awesome,\" Conde said. \"The whole crowd oohed and she's as soon as it slipped into totality.\"\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nThey came, they eclipsed, they're outta here\n\nSALEM’S RIVERFRONT PARK, 12:30 p.m. – Visitors broke camp at Salem’s Riverfront Park, though some stragglers remained in the early afternoon.\n\nTents abounded here Monday morning, but just after noon, many had vanished.\n\nThea Nelson-Jerry and her family had set up Saturday evening. But they didn’t waste much time after the total eclipse. They dismantled their spacious tent, preparing to return to the Muckleshoot Reservation in Washington.\n\n— Jonathan Bach\n\nBeauty of eclipse moves some to tears\n\nFinding the words to describe the experience of totality wasn't easy for campers at Solartown just outside of Madras, Oregon.\n\n\"Short of the birth of my kids, it was the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life,\" David Wiza Of Beaverton said. \"I'm an emotional baby anyway, but holy cow.\"\n\nHe and his wife, Kathy, hugged — but only after totality was over.\n\nThey refrained from taking photos so they could enjoy the experience.\n\n\"I didn't want to waste any time looking away,\" he said.\n\nHe learned his lesson watching the 2010 Shuttle Endeavor launch, which he said was the last night launch of a space shuttle.\n\n\"I have fond memories as it appeared through my viewfinder,\" he said. \"And I just wasn't going to do that again. I told myself I was going to look.”\n\nKarri White, a banker from Santa Cruz, California, choked up and wiped away tears after she and her family and friends did a group hug during totality.\n\n\"It was the most beautiful experience I've had,\" she said. \"In the midst of it, I teared up. It was just a glorious feeling.\"\n\n\"It reminds me of why I became a physicist,\" said her son, Cameron White, who just graduated from UC Santa Cruz and is headed to graduate school at San Diego State University.\n\nCameron was impressed viewing Saturn's rings through a super high-powered telescope at UCSC.\n\n\"I thought Saturn was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This was 100 times better.\"\n\n— Capi Lynn\n\nAnticipation, wait for eclipse worth it for Baskett Slough visitors\n\nBASKETT SLOUGH, 12:10 p.m. — The turkey vultures went to roost a little after 10 a.m. at Baskett Slough Wildlife Refuge. Then the crickets began to chirp, visitors pulled on sweaters and the sun disappeared from the sky.\n\nThe anticipation had built on a hill near an observation deck in the hour prior. Scattered groups talked and took selfies in the grassy area.\n\n\"It's getting dark isn't it?\" said one girl in the last minutes before totality. There was a collective shout of \"Venus!\" as many fingers quickly pointed to a sudden bright spot in the sky. Then glasses clinked in a toast as the shadow aligned over the sun entirely.\n\nWhen the light came back, everyone stood around, amazed.\n\nLaura Newton, traveling from Washington state with her recently married sister and brother-in-law, was speechless at first.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen something that was so awesome in my entire life,\" she said. \"It left me in awe.\"\n\nOn the other side of the hill, Joanna Picchi was wishing it had gone a little longer.\n\n\"It was beyond expectations. But it all happened so fast. I just wanted it to stay for a while to soak it all up,\" she said. \"It was really a spiritual experience.\"\n\nWithin minutes, most of the visitors had begun to trickle off the butte and down the hill.\n\nMiel Corbett, a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman, stood nearby, collecting trash from people and thanking them for visiting.\n\n\"We've never seen so many people on Baskett Butte at one time,\" she laughed.\n\nAs most of the groups filed out down the trails, the sun was beating down bright again. Besides the fireworks in the distance, it looked like a normal, albeit busy, day at the wildlife refuge.\n\n— Cooper Green\n\nEven during eclipse, Girl Scouts have cookies\n\nAbout two dozen Girl Scouts got an extra special view of the eclipse, watching with Gov. Kate Brown and other dignitaries on a private patio at the Capitol.\n\n“It’s such a fun place to see the eclipse,” said Rhyanne Vanness, 7, of Woodburn.\n\nAs the moon crept slowly across the sun, they gave the Governor Girl Scout cookies and posed for pictures.\n\nA hush settled over the crowd as totality approached, then cheers and even some sobs broke out.\n\n“I thought it was amazing,” Genevieve Trentzsch, 10, of Woodburn said afterward. “It was like a whole different world.”\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service also presented Brown with a framed commemorative postmark celebrating Salem’s place in the path of totality. The stamps are available in the Capitol Galleria until 1:30 p.m. today.\n\nBefore her private event, Brown made a quick trip outside the Capitol building, where hundreds of eclipse watchers settled in.\n\n— Tracy Loew\n\nCrowds at Willamette in awe of eclipse\n\nSALEM, 11:45 a.m. – The kind of applause usually only reserved for the world’s biggest musical acts was delivered for a natural phenomenon.\n\nThousands of people – old and young, of all different socioeconomic status and from all over the world – gathered on the lawns of Willamette University Monday morning to watch the total solar eclipse, and they got a show no rock band could ever deliver.\n\nFew knew the magnitude of what was coming; most didn’t.\n\nBut when the world went dark and only a ring of light hung in the sky, the crowd that had been cheering throughout the countdown rose to a fever pitch.\n\n“They’ll tell their grandchildren about what they saw on the 21st of August, 2017,” said Paddy Brennan, who came to Salem from Ireland with 36 members of the Cork Astronomy Club.\n\n“This is an extraordinary event. It might encourage them to do science because science is something that’s helping us along in every field.”\n\nComing 5,000 or so miles to bear witness something so dependent on weather would seem a risk to most.\n\nSeeing the moon completely block out the sun for almost two minutes was worth the expense, time and planning for the Irish, and if they weren’t committed before, they’re hooked now.\n\n“We’re looking forward to seven year’s time,” said Margaret Jackson, one of the 36 Irish club members on hand. “We’re looking forward to New York.”\n\nIn 2006 Brennan traveled to Turkey from Ireland to witness a total eclipse. He said the one in Salem wasn’t as long, but it was darker.\n\nAnd the atmosphere of the crowd at Willamette magnified the event.\n\n“That’s extraordinary, it’s an extraordinary happening in nature,” Brennan said. “And you wonder why people travel the world to see these. Totality. Up in Portland you’d have a partial eclipse, maybe 99, but it’s not the same.\n\n“It’s an extraordinary event and you have to experience totality to understand.”\n\n— Bill Poehler\n\nAn eclipse skeptic, until she saw it in person\n\nSALEM’S RIVERFRONT PARK — When Kev Brock’s husband pushed to see Monday’s total solar eclipse, she thought he was going a little overboard. She read stories about people who cried and cheered, and remembered thinking they were “overly dramatic.”\n\n“But that was one of the most incredible things I’ve ever seen. It made me cry and my children cheered along with the rest of the crowd,” Brock said in a text after the eclipse plunged Salem’s Riverfront Park into darkness, revealing the crisp white atmosphere of the sun.\n\n“It was amazing to be amongst a crowd of people who felt the same,” Brock said.\n\nMark Strickland, 27, of Irvine, California, put it in simple terms: “That was phenomenal, being able to go through that experience.”\n\nHis friend, Kip Whittier, felt sorry for anyone on the planet who didn’t experience the phenomenon.\n\n“It’s not gonna happen again for so long,” the 23-year-old said.\n\n-Jonathan Bach\n\nCrowds take to area highways after the eclipse\n\nSALEM, 11:10 a.m. — As predicted by officials, eclipse viewers began taking to road shortly after the completion of totality over the Mid-Willamette Valley.\n\nODOT's TripCheck showed heavy congestion on stretches of Interstate 5 heading north and south out of the Salem area.\n\nTraffic through the Salem on surface streets was moderate but flowing smoothly.\n\nNo crashes have been reported as of 11:00 a.m.\n\nSalem's solar eclipse is over: Now what?\n\nBaseball, eclipse bring family a special moment\n\nKEIZER - \"Look at that! Oh my God! That was amazing!\"\n\nThose were some of the reactions from fans as totality arrived Monday at Volcanoes Stadium during the first Eclipse Game in baseball history, featuring the host Salem-Keizer Volcanoes vs. the Hillsboro Hops.\n\nJoan Bouchard wanted to share the historic moment with her granddaughter.\n\n\"It was very moving. I will never be around to see another one, so this was very important to me,\" Bouchard said.\n\nHer granddaughter, Chase Schechter from Wilsonville, called the total solar eclipse \"the coolest thing ever.\"\n\n\"I was surprised that people were coming from all over the world to see this, but now that I've seen it I would definitely go again,\" Chase said.\n\nFans from 34 states and eight countries were in attendance at Volcanoes Stadium when Totality arrived at 10:17 a.m.\n\n- Gary Horowitz\n\nCrowds at the Oregon State Fairgrounds begin to view the eclipse\n\nAs the eclipse began shortly after 9 a.m. Monday morning, Charles Valle helped his two children, Ivan and Olive, put their viewing glasses on. They turned their faces upwards.\n\n\"I see it,\" Ivan, 4, said to his dad.\n\n\"What does it look like,\" Charles asked, as his wife Kathleen grabbed food from a nearby breakfast stand. \"Does it look like someone took a bite out of the sun?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" cheered Ivan and Olive, 2.\n\n\"That's the moon getting in the way,\" Charles said.\n\n— Natalie Pate\n\nEclipse visitors give out extra glasses\n\nTracy Bartlett, of Joshua Tree, California, hands out her group's extra eclipse viewer glasses to strangers at Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nShe and her friends drove up Saturday to avoid traffic and set up camp in the park's lower field. \"I'm glad they opened up the park to camping,\" she said, adding that she's enjoyed the pleasant weather and walking paths of the city.\n\nShe and her friends walked downtown yesterday and saw a movie.\n\nThey plan to wait until the first wave of traffic leaves before heading to Eugene.\n\n— Whitney Woodworth\n\nSome eclipse watchers are more serious than others\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS 9:30 a.m. - Some people are so serious about observing the eclipse they don't have time to chat.\n\nI stopped to introduce myself to a gentleman with a fancy telescope and camera setup, and he ignored my greetings.\n\nHe had earplugs in, so I waved to get his attention.\n\nOne of his camping neighbors said he was still trying to get set up, offering a hint of apology.\n\nI explained I was with the media, and then the gentleman acknowledged my presence and said: \"Maybe later.\"\n\n— Capi Lynn\n\nSilverton students launch balloon for eclipse experiment\n\nSILVERTON – Silverton High School was the launch site of a high-altitude balloon Monday morning, and the launch went off without a hitch at 8:45 a.m.\n\nThe high school program was one of 55 teams nationwide that built balloons that will capture data and video of the eclipse, which will be utilized by NASA.\n\n“It actually went as textbook as it could have gone,” project coordinator Creighton Helms said.\n\nHelms said the project faced obstacles in the weeks and days leading up to the launch: wind forecasts that would have pushed the balloon to restricted airspace above wildfires, GPS units not working and having to be overnighted to NASA for repair and overnighted back, and a camera that required repair up until 1 a.m. on launch day.\n\nNo problem.\n\n“Everything just came together and allowed us to be able to fly,” Helms said. “The winds were light and the conditions were good and everything that we had practiced went exactly as we had done. The balloon lifted off the ground like a pillow.”\n\nHundreds gathered at the soccer fields at Silverton High to witness the event, and an enthusiastic countdown helped set the balloon off for launch. A project that began 10 months ago, which was months behind other projects around the country, went off without a problem.\n\nNext comes retrieval of the balloon and its cameras and tracking contents. With conditions calmer than expected, that should happen later today, and Helms said it could come down a mere 10 miles away from the high school.\n\n— Lee Clarkson\n\nFamily makes last-minute decision to view eclipse from Englewood Park\n\nSALEM, 9:40 a.m. — When the McFarland family of Snohomish, Washington set up camp in North Salem's Englewood Park, they didn't know they legally could.\n\nWhen Jesse and Briana McFarland drove down from Northern Washington with their three kids and dog, they had a reservation at Salem RV. When they saw the spot, they decided to scout for a new location.\n\n\"Our plan was ill-defined,\" Jesse McFarland said over breakfast in the park. \"We wanted to get to the path of totality, and Salem hit the sweet spot for us.\"\n\nEnglewood Park, a small wooded park near the elementary school, was mostly vacant Sunday evening. The family drove around until they found the spot, saw another pitched tent and hoped for the best.\n\n\"If we had known, and we had found this park again, we would have done the exact same thing,\" Jesse McFarland said.\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nDon't have eclipse glasses? Find a tree\n\nSALEM, 9:10 a.m. – If you get tired of wearing your eclipse glasses, there’s another way to enjoy the event: Find a tree.\n\nStand under a tree during the eclipse and you might experience what Jim Todd, with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, calls a “natural pinhole.”\n\nThat’s because trees and their leaves can act like pinhole projectors during solar eclipses. Each gap in the leaves acts like a pinhole, projecting the image of eclipsed sun below.\n\nChris Fuld, who camped in Salem with a tent and sleeping bag to catch Monday’s eclipse, has experienced it before: “You’ll see little suns.”\n\nFuld, of Bellevue, Washington, first saw it with leaves in Atlanta, Georgia, during a partial eclipse decades ago.\n\n“(It was) very similar to like what you see when you see the Northern Lights for the first time,” he said. “You don’t really process it.\"\n\n— Jonathan Bach\n\n► What to watch for:See four planets and other stars\n\nVisitor invests in Volcanoes eclipse memorabilia\n\nKEIZER, 8:50 p.m. — When Jeremy Schmidt entered the gates of Volcanoes Stadium at 5 a.m., one of the first things he did was load up with Eclipse Game souvenirs.\n\nHe purchased an Eclipse jersey for himself, and assorted t-shirts, sweat shirts, a baseball and small bat for family members. The $300-plus investment was worth it to commemorate the first Eclipse Game in baseball history.\n\n“I figured I’d buy something. I wasn’t sure what,” said Schmidt, who made the drive from Seattle. “I bought something for the whole family.”\n\nIt was Schmidt’s first game at Volcanoes Stadium and he purchased tickets for the Eclipse Game eight months ago.\n\n“A friend of our told us about it and we were like, let’s do something because we wanted to see the solar eclipse down here anyways,” he said.\n\n— Gary Horowitz\n\nCapitol Mall still has room and free eclipse glasses\n\nThe Capitol Mall is filling slowly, but there is plenty of room left, and free eclipse glasses are available.\n\n\n\nOn the mall, people lined up to take part in a free Aztec cleansing ceremony performed by Portlander Javier Rojas and his family.\n\n\n\nOthers settled in with small tents, air mattresses and lawn chairs.\n\n\n\nEllen Vyas traveled down from Seattle Saturday night to stay with friends. Her four kids seemed more excited about the viewing glasses than the eclipse, she said.\n\n\n\nRon and Stacey Alley, of McMinnville, put up a tent to sell eclipse art, T-shirts and snacks. Business was good and the T-shirts were almost gone, Alley said.\n\n\n\nJanellia Lejsea Capelle waited for eclipse glasses in a line that snaked down Court Street. Her four kids were jumping with excitement.\n\n\n\nWhile all eyes were focused on the east, Ryan Jackson set up a 360 degree video camera in the middle of the crowd.\n\n\n\nJackson, of Edmonton, Alberta, is tasked with filming the crowd for a Montreal Planetarium documentary.\n\n\n\n“While everyone else is watching the eclipse, I’ll be watching them,” he said.\n\n\n\n- Tracy Loew\n\nFairgrounds draws eclipse visitors from around the world\n\nAmateur astronomer Robert Nelson requested Monday, Aug. 21, off from work nearly a year ago. He and his wife, Afton, were not going to miss it.\n\n\n\nMonday morning, Robert was spotted setting up a telescope at the Rose City Astronomer's booth at the Oregon State Fairgrounds. He was setting it up for attendees to view Venus, which looked like a small speck of light when looking through the telescope.\n\n\n\nThey, like many others, left early Sunday afternoon to get from Portland to Salem. When pleasantly surprised by the lack of cars sitting bumper-to-bumper on the freeway, they stopped in Woodburn for a few hours to visit family.\n\n\n\nThousands of other people and families were at the fairgrounds Monday as well.\n\n\n\nUlrike and Sylvio Redanz from Germany were spotted taking photos with their 6- and 2-year-old children in front of an eclipse-themed backdrop near the ground's entrance. The family is stationed in Portland for work for three years as Sylvio studies oral bacteria for Oregon Health & Science University, but he said it was a \"happy coincidence\" that the eclipse happened while they were in the state.\n\n\n\nAdrian Peña and his wife, Mitsue Shibata, brought their 10-year-old daughter to Salem from Vancouver, Washington, and are staying in Sublimity. They both have seen partial eclipses but never a total eclipse.\n\n— Natalie Pate\n\nCampers well behaved in Salem parks\n\nSALEM, 8:30 A.M. — More than 2,000 people camped overnight in city parks, according to city officials. Staff found 2,300 campers in 15 of the city's 93 parks, mostly in the largest ones: Bush's Pasture Park, Riverfront Park and Minto-Brown Island Park. No problems were reported.\n\nNo parking is available in Minto-Brown or Lansing parks.\n\nCity officials remind campers than normal park rules go into effect later today — meaning sprinklers will be turned on tonight.\n\n— Statesman Journal\n\nFamily is waiting for some eclipse magic\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS, 8: 10 a.m. - The Maire family spent some time Sunday night on top of their motor home, checking out the view.\n\nThat's where they plan to be come go time for the eclipse. Gina and Justin Maire, from San Luis Obispo, California, brought their four children to Solartown for this once-in-a-lifetime celestial experience.\n\nMalia and Mikayla are 13-year-old twins, Jake is 11, and Bode is 7.\n\nMalia said she was looking forward to watching the magic that is supposed to happen around Mount Jefferson during the eclipse.\n\n— Capi Lynn\n\nEclipse game lures indifferent baseball fan\n\nKEIZER, 7:40 a.m. — Karin Bond arrived at Volcanoes Stadium early Monday morning to witness the first game in baseball history delayed due to a total solar eclipse.\n\n“Actually, I’ve only been to two other baseball games in my life,” said Bond, who was in town from Aurora, Colorado. “Once with my father, once with my husband.”\n\nHer last baseball game prior to Monday came in the 1960s.\n\n“I thought it would be fun to see the eclipse with my friend Virginia,” Bond said. “We’ve traveled all over the world together.”\n\nBond acknowledged that it “seems pretty odd” to be in a baseball stadium, much less at 7 a.m. for a 9:35 a.m. opening pitch. The Salem-Keizer Volcanoes will be playing the Hillsboro Hops in a Northwest League game.\n\nBond qualifies as an eclipse chaser of sorts. It will be the third total solar eclipse she's witnessed in person, the most recent one coming in 2006 in Turkey.\n\n— Gary Horowitz\n\nEclipse adventure wins over La La Land\n\nSALEM’S RIVERFRONT PARK, 7:01 a.m. – Equipped with an eclipse-viewing telescope and binoculars – plus black coffee and a chai latte – Michael Bergeron and Kevin Lewis were two among many at Salem’s Riverfront Park in the early morning hours Monday awaiting a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe pair, from San Francisco, rolled into town on an early bus – Lewis figures it was about 2 a.m. – after visiting friends in Portland. They chose Salem and the eclipse over a trip to Los Angeles.\n\n“(It) was an adventure instead of a stupid vacation,” Lewis said.\n\nMany ventured to Riverfront Park this weekend to pitch their camps, transforming this park on the Willamette River into a tent village.\n\nThe weather bodes well: Skies last night offered a view of the stars, even over a light-pollution heavy city like Salem. The view is similarly clear this morning, meaning those binoculars and the telescope are sure to get a lot of use.\n\n“So little in life these days lives up to the hype,” Lewis said.\n\nBut the eclipse, he thinks, is different.\n\n— Jonathan Bach\n\nSalem airport is buzzing\n\nSALEM, 7:15 a.m. — Planes are arriving at a brisk clip at Salem Municipal Airport.\n\nAbout 115 planes are expected to touch down for the total solar eclipse, in addition to the 175 that are based here.\n\nAmong the visitors expected is a group of scientists from California that will be shuttled in on a corporate jet, and members of a flying club from Washington that will be traveling in 30 small aircraft.\n\nWhile most of the incoming will be on “mom and pop” planes, some of the larger aircraft expected to land at McNary Field for the eclipse include a Beechcraft 1900, a Gulf Stream 450, a Learjet 35, and maybe even a Boeing 737.\n\n— Statesman Journal\n\nTrash stacks up, toilets back up\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS, 6:30 a.m. - What a relief that eclipse day is here.\n\nOrganizers at Solartown are no longer able to keep up with the sanitation needs of campers in more than 5,000 RV and tent sites.\n\nPiles of garbage are growing throughout the campground, and the porta potties are on the verge of overflowing and out of toilet paper.\n\nThe only dumpster appears to be the one behind the food vendors, and the Madras FFA students who were volunteering to empty the cardboard garbage bins seem to have disappeared.\n\nThe mobile shower also was shut down sometime Sunday. Earlier in the day, drainage in many of the stalls was a problem.\n\nOther inconveniences that have everyone thankful the eclipse is happening today include a four-hour wait for vehicles to get back into Solartown and an hour-long wait at one of the two coffee huts.\n\n— Capi Lynn\n\nBaseball fans arrive before sunrise\n\nKEIZER, 6 A.M. – Fans began arriving at 5 a.m. Monday at Volcanoes Stadium for the first Eclipse Game in baseball history.\n\nSigns were posted en route to the ballpark on Keizer Station Boulevard noting that the game was sold out. At 6 a.m. cars were backed up waiting to enter the parking lot.\n\nAll fans were given safety glasses to view the total solar eclipse.\n\nVolcanoes officials said the baseball from today's opening pitch, and the first ball used after the eclipse delay, will be sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\n- Gary Horowitz\n\nTaiko drums and ice sculptures at the fairgrounds\n\nOREGON STATE FAIRGROUNDS, 6:45 a.m. -- As the sun rose over the Oregon State Fair fairgrounds Monday morning, Portland Taiko drummers beat the traditional Japanese instrument on the stage of the amphitheater.\n\nChants and staging created an entrancing performance to kick off the 2017 total solar eclipse festivities.\n\nA line wrapped around the 17th street entrance of the fairgrounds, with 9,000 people expected to attend the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry's solar viewing party in Salem. The event has been sold out for months.\n\nIn addition to rows of booths with everything from teriyaki chicken and yakisoba noodles to tables with telescopes and scientific demonstrations, participants were greeted with numerous activities upon entry.\n\nImmediately inside, attendees will see ICEovation artists carving two ice sculptures -- one of the sun and the other of a small person with his or her arms up.\n\nJames Stugart, owner of the custom ice sculpture business, said he and his artists, Tommi Stugart and Randee Metayer, will finish carving the sculpture and when the time is right (AKA as close to totality as possible).\n\n— Natalie Pate\n\nOSU:Scientists to study 'breath of land'\n\nTraffic passable, coffee is crowded\n\nDOWNTOWN, 6 a.m. — At the dawn of the Great American Eclipse, downtown Salem traffic was moving smoothly, if not a little light for this time of day.\n\nPeople had been parking on the street since late Sunday night with a great number of people sleeping in their cars in front of the state Capital to beat the traffic.\n\nThe only places where people were really congregating: coffee shops.\n\nBut there’s a twist: The line to get coffee was five minutes; the line for the bathroom was 10 minutes.\n\n— Bill Poehler\n\nRefuge fills before dawn\n\nDALLAS, 6:30 a.m. — The parking lot was full long before the stars disappeared at Baskett Slough.\n\nEclipse fiends from all over flocked to the wildlife refuge west of Salem, lining the tight gravel roads with parked cars and campers.\n\n\"It wasn't planned, but it was expected. We only planned for the parking lots,\" said Ken Robins, a federal wildlife officer. \"It's way more visitation than we're used to.\"\n\nThe small parking lot filled around 3 a.m., based on the arrival of some visitors.\n\nKarl Brown, from Portland, said he arrived during that time and found a space. Brown said he'd just learned about the eclipse recently and thought this would be a good viewing spot.\n\n\"Figured it'd probably be less busy than anywhere else, less busy than big national campgrounds,\" he said.\n\nRobins estimated the slough was host to around 500 visitors by 6 a.m. He guessed Ankeny Wildlife Refuge nearby had a similar number.\n\n\"Mostly we're just trying to avoid people from going in areas that are habitat for endangered butterflies and just trying to avoid fires, that's the main concern,\" he said.\n\n— Cooper Green\n\nSolartown creates a city the size of Woodburn\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS, 5:30 a.m. — More than 20,000 people, who will soon be waking up to prepare for the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in 99 years, are calling this temporary city home.\n\nThat would make it about the size of Woodburn.\n\nThe population estimate of Solartown, a makeshift campground just outside Madras, is based on there being more than 5,000 RV and tent sites and an average of four people per site.\n\nThere are 28 cities in Oregon with more than 20,000 residents, according to the Population Research Center at Portland State University, and 17 with at least 30,000.\n\nWoodburn has a population of 24,795. Other 20,000-resident-plus cities in Oregon that Solartown compares to include nearby Redmond, as well as Wilsonville, Newberg and Ashland.\n\nSalem has a population of 162,060 and Keizer 37,505.\n\nCloud cover not expected to impact view\n\nSALEM, 4:45 a.m. — The National Weather Service says Oregon could see areas of thin cloud cover, high in the sky Monday.\n\n\"However, these should not be thick enough to limit visibility of the eclipse,\" the agency said on Twitter late Sunday.\n\nYaquina Lighthouse:The first place to see the darkness\n\nCoffee shop recalls eclipse glasses\n\nSALEM, 4:30 a.m. — Dutch Bros Coffee is warning customers to not use glasses the company handed out from stands after the company was unable to authenticate the necessary certification.\n\nEclipse glasses should have a specific ISO (international standards organization) certification, with number 12312-2. Other companies, including Amazon, also issued recalls after counterfeit glasses ended up in the hands of consumers.\n\nThe company issued a voluntary recall on their Facebook page late Sunday.\n\n\"If you received a pair of these glasses, DO NOT USE THEM TO VIEW THE ECLIPSE,\" the post stated.\n\nThe company will take glasses back at the location originally obtained for a free drink.\n\nEclipse glasses:How to spot unsafe fakes\n\nSmall but steady traffic traveling I-5 south\n\nSALEM, 4:15 a.m. — Predawn Salem streets early Monday were slightly busier than the usual weekday morning.\n\nA small but steady stream of cars left southbound Interstate 5 exits in north Salem just before 4 a.m.\n\nThe 24-hour Denny's location just off the Market Street exit saw packed tables as the occasional group of cars left the interstate and headed for destinations across town.\n\nOregon Department of Transportation's TripCheck website showed no slowdowns or crashes on area highways.\n\nWhile the anticipated crowds failed to materialize in the Mid-Willamette Valley over the weekend, officials were still following plans to have resources in place should crowds make the decision to drive down today for the eclipse.\n\n— David Davis\n\nMore:Procrastinator's guide to the solar eclipse\n\nDriving:Keep your eyes on the road during eclipse\n\nPost Office offering eclipse postmark and stamp\n\nSALEM, 4 a.m. — A special postmark will be available on Aug. 21 to celebrate the total eclipse, joining the already available Total Eclipse Forever Stamps.

The moon blocks the light from the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth that, in the path of totality, turns day into twilight. It's only by coincidence that the moon is able to do this. The sun is 400 times wider than the moon, but it is also 400 times farther away, so they appear to be the same size in the sky.\n\nLast time in Oregon: It was Feb. 26, 1979, which also crossed Washington, Idaho, Montana and North Dakota. It was the dead of winter, so not surprisingly the weather was described as \"bleak.\"\n\nWhy \"Great American Eclipse?\": This is the first total solar eclipse to only pass over the United States and no other nation since the country was founded.\n\nThe path of totality: The shadow of the moon as it entirely blocks the sun's light will sweep across parts of 12 states: Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nSome Oregon cities in the pathinclude: Lincoln City, Newport, Dallas, Salem, Albany, Lebanon, Sweet Home, Madras, Fossil, Baker City and Ontario.\n\nSpeedy shadow: The moon's shadow hauls. It will average more than 1,600 mph, but will actually slow down as it travels across the country because of the relationship between the earth's and moon's rotations and the planet's curvature. In Oregon, the speed will top 2,200 mph, just less than three times the speed of sound. It will take 91 minutes for the eclipse to cross the country, but it will only be visible for a couple minutes at any given location.\n\nFor the love of science\n\nChristopher Shang loves science, and he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to watch Monday’s total solar eclipse.\n\nThe Bellevue, Washington, resident was camping with friends and family Sunday afternoon at Woodmansee Park in South Salem, where about a dozen tents were set up.\n\n“We saw an article in Time (magazine) about the eclipse, and it was like, ‘Oh, hey, there is an eclipse heading down through Oregon,’” Shang said. “So we might as well come down here and check it out. It’s a rare occurrence, in the United States anyway.”\n\nShang said his group chose Woodmansee Park because they didn’t want to have to fight eclipse traffic Monday morning, which could have happened had they stayed in a hotel.\n\nDespite having the options of going to either central Oregon or the coast, Shang and his group chose Salem so they could be closer to Portland.\n\n“We wanted to head to Portland either way, because Portland is a cool place,” Shang said. “So we decided to head to Salem to see the eclipse, and then knock Portland off the list at the same time.”\n\n— Pete Martini", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/21"}]}

Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun’s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun.\n\nWhen is the total solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total solar eclipse is on Monday, April 8.\n\nThe duration of totality will last four minutes and 27 seconds, nearly double that of the total solar eclipse seen in the United States in 2017, according to Great American Eclipse.\n\nAlthough the next total solar eclipse will be visible elsewhere on Aug. 12, 2026, if you miss out on April 8, the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous U.S. won’t arrive until Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nWhat time will the total solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe path of totality — when the moon completely covers the sun, creating a total eclipse — runs from Mexico (Sinaloa to Coahuila) to the United States (Texas to Maine) to Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland), according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nThe following U.S. cities are in the path of totality, according to NASA:\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri\n\nPaducah, Kentucky\n\nEvansville, Indiana\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nErie, Pennsylvania\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire\n\nCaribou, Maine\n\nAreas near these cities will experience a partial eclipse before and after the time totality is expected. A partial eclipse will be visible across nearly all of the U.S. and a small portion of western Europe.\n\nGlobal eclipse events will occur at the following local times:\n\nPartial eclipse will first be visible at 11:42 a.m.\n\nFull eclipse will first be visible at 12:38 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse will be visible at 2:17 p.m.\n\nFull eclipse will last be visible at 3:55 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse will last be visible at 4:52 p.m.\n\nIn Delaware:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible. As for any part of the eclipse, not just totality, 8.19% of the population, or 652 million people, will be able to tune in, according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nSolar eclipse viewing safety\n\nDo not look directly at the sun without eye protection specifically designed for solar viewing. Without protection, the sun’s radiation can burn the retinas in your eyes, leading to permanent damage or blindness.\n\nEclipse glasses can be purchased at a variety of retailers in-store or online, and you also can indirectly view the eclipse by using a pinhole projector.\n\nThe sun will be very bright during the eclipse, so if you plan to watch and will be in direct sunlight for hours, wear protective clothing, a hat and lather on sunscreen to prevent skin damage.\n\nWhen the eclipse is at totality, this is the only moment you can briefly remove your eclipse glasses and look at the sun directly with your eyes.\n\nWhere to watch the total solar eclipse in Delaware\n\nA partial eclipse is all that will be visible to the entire state of Delaware.\n\nWhile various geolocating sites can help you find out when exactly you can check out the eclipse from your house, you might be interested in watching the phenomenon from elsewhere.\n\nSome of our top picks here for star gazing also might be a good place to enjoy the total solar eclipse in April.\n\nYour favorite local hangout\n\nDelaware is teeming with parks and green spaces, and we bet you already have a go-to, so all that’s left to do is grab a blanket, pack some snacks and pick up a friend.\n\nIt might be a park in your neighborhood or it could be a quiet spot beneath a tree. Wherever you end up, be sure to heed notices about park closing times and property restrictions.\n\nDelaware beaches, various locations\n\nWe know everyone says they like long walks on the beach under the moonlight in their dating profiles, but they may be on to something.\n\nGrab your beach blanket and head down to the sand to enjoy a full moon, blood moon or shooting star. The sound of crashing waves is a bonus.\n\nIf you want the benefits of an oceanside sky show, but not the sand in your hair or shoes, consider catching the next meteor shower while on a stroll on the Rehoboth Boardwalk or parked on a bench with your ice cream or pizza.\n\nNewark Reservoir, Newark\n\nIf you find that your area is a bit too obstructed by light pollution, the Newark Reservoir offers an elevated surface for you to be away from city lights and closer to the sky.\n\nThis serene spot would be a great mini getaway for catching a daytime eclipse with friends or watching the stars twinkle into view at sunset.\n\nYour backyard\n\nIt may not be a drastic change of scenery but don’t sleep on the freedom of hosting a shooting star watch party in the comfort of your own backyard.\n\nNot only do you have direct access to all the snacks you could want, but it’s less of a hassle to set up your telescope just a few yards from your back door than it is to lug it across town in your car.\n\nYou and your pals can set up a tent or give your yard a makeover with plenty of blankets, pillows and refreshments to go around.\n\nTotal solar eclipse details:A total solar eclipse will be visible in the U.S. this spring for the first time in 7 years\n\nWilmington Riverfront, Wilmington\n\nThe Christina River is no Atlantic Ocean, but we have to admit that the Wilmington Riverfront has a pretty decent boardwalk for us northern Delawareans who can’t make a late-night journey to the beach.\n\nFill up on tasty food and drinks at nearby restaurants before taking a post-meal trip to the Riverwalk. Get comfortable on one of the benches stationed along the way or lace up your shoes and walk the entire thing to catch the next Saturn appearance or guest visit from Jupiter’s moons.\n\nDelaware state parks, various locations\n\nWith 17 state parks across Delaware’s three counties, you can’t tell us there isn’t a place near you that doesn’t pique your space interest.\n\nFrom White Clay Creek in New Castle County to First State Heritage Park in Kent County to Fenwick Island in Sussex County, there’s plenty of ground to cover when it comes to serene spots for solar viewings.\n\nDelaware state parks close at sunset, but if you find yourself camping at one of them during a full moon or the next meteor shower, you’ll have plenty of time and space to enjoy the view.\n\nBattery Park, New Castle\n\nLocated in New Castle, Battery Park borders the Delaware River and has walking trails, benches to sit on and an old pier.\n\nPark your telescope in front of the nearest bench, sit back and enjoy the view. If you have time to spare, grab a bite to eat or check out some of the local shops and historic sites beforehand.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Here's where to go\n\nWhat will Delaware see during the eclipse?\n\nDelaware is not in the path of totality, so only a partial eclipse will be seen in the Small Wonder.\n\nEclipse action in Delaware will take place at the following times:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nEclipse viewing:The total solar eclipse will be here soon. Here's where you can plan to watch in Delaware\n\nStages of a total solar eclipse\n\nMany people focus on the moment of totality when they think of a total solar eclipse, but there are actually several distinct stages of the event that those observing can keep an eye out for.\n\nHere are the phases of a total solar eclipse, most of which Delawareans can look forward to, according to NASA:\n\nDuring a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover the sun at first, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape. When the moon first touches the sun, it is also called the “first contact.”\n\nShadow bands are long, dark, rapidly moving bands separated by white spaces that can be seen on the ground or on the sides of buildings just before or after totality.\n\nBaily’s beads are the several points of light that shine around the moon’s edges as it continues to move across the sun. They are caused by light rays from the sun streaming through the valleys along the moon’s horizon. Baily’s Beads appear for only a short amount of time and may not be noticeable to everyone watching the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe diamond ring effect occurs at the beginning and end of totality during a total solar eclipse. As Baily’s beads begin to disappear, and the last bits of sunlight pass through the valleys on the moon’s limb, the faint corona around the sun is just becoming visible along the edge of the moon’s shadow and looks like a ring with shining diamonds on it.\n\nTotality occurs once the diamond ring disappears and there is no longer any direct sunlight, also known as “second contact.” At this point, eclipse viewers may be able to see the chromosphere — a region of the solar atmosphere that appears as the thin circle of pink around the moon — and the corona, appearing as streams of white light.\n\nAs the moon continues to move across the sun, brightening will appear on the opposite side from where the diamond ring appeared at the beginning. This is the lower atmosphere of the sun beginning to peek out from behind the moon. Your eclipse glasses must be on before the first flash of sunlight appears around the edges of the moon, known as “third contact.”\n\nAs the final stages of the eclipse commence, the beginning process you just witnessed will be mirrored. The diamond ring will appear first, followed by Bailey’s beads and the shadow bands before the entire sun is visible again. “Fourth contact” is the moment that none of the sun is covered by the moon’s shadow and signals the end of the eclipse.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Though the First State may not be in \"the path of totality,\" as experts determined, a partial eclipse sighting is expected in the afternoon.\n\nAnd Peter Kelly is one teacher looking to take advantage.\n\n\"Having students experience it, it's really a wonderful and exciting moment,\" said the seventh grade science teacher at Brandywine Springs. \"There are no screens involved. They can experience it live. And it's a great opportunity for learning and education because it can really have them think about their place in space.\"\n\nWhere some might close shades, even close schools to limit viewing — this building's lead science teacher has been encouraging schools throughout Red Clay Consolidated School District to jump on board. He started discussions with the administration as early as last year, and by the fall, he was looking for equipment.\n\nEclipse facts vs. fiction:Eclipse myths busted by NASA, other experts as Delaware anticipates event\n\nThrough partnership and grant funding, Kelly managed to ensure all students at Brandywine Springs will get protective solar glasses for viewing. This meets upcoming lessons, ongoing work and reading on the celestial wonder.\n\n\"All my classes that day: We'll talk about the eclipse,\" he said.\n\nKendra Moritz Rosner couldn't agree more. She hopes everyone in the building is talking solar eclipse.\n\nNot only is the educator at Lorewood Grove Elementary ready to take students out during the natural event, Moritz Rosner has been prepping lessons and material for teachers across her school. After 17 years of teaching, the STEAM coordinator now looks to teach students across grade levels about the engineering and design processes behind subjects like science, technology, engineering, art/agriculture and math/music.\n\nLeading up to April 8, that also will look like counsel on viewing safety, from solar glasses and goggles, to pinhole-projector creation with older students.\n\n\"It turns out, as a school, we're going to go ahead and do this,\" Moritz Rosner said with a smile. \"So while I'm kind of bringing the 'What is this exactly that we're going to see in the sky,' all of the teachers — at least third, fourth and fifth — are going to get the kids ready to actually go outside. And as long as it's a beautiful day, we'll be able to see the solar eclipse.\"\n\nShe knows something like this can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And the Appoquinimink educator hopes it will get students engaged, maybe even having them bring that excitement out of the classroom.\n\n\"Here's an opportunity for you to see a real-life science experiment in the sky,\" Moritz Rosner said.\n\nWhat to know about Delaware's eclipse\n\nBoth of these educators made sure to get their hands on the right eyewear ahead of this eclipse. Why?\n\nViewers cannot look directly at the sun without eye protection specifically designed for solar viewing. Without it, the sun’s radiation can instantly burn the retina, leading to permanent eye damage or blindness. Even sunscreen and protective clothing are encouraged for those planning to be outside for hours.\n\nEclipse prep:Where to get solar eclipse glasses, eclipse safety and how to make your own solar viewers\n\nWherever onlookers choose to get glasses from, as previously reported, they need to make sure the frames meet safety requirements of the ISO 12312-2 international standard and are sold from a reputable seller acknowledged by the American Astronomical Society. Make plans soon, as reports showed places selling out close to similar events.\n\nOne can also indirectly view the eclipse using a pinhole projector, easily made at home.\n\nLike Delaware, a partial eclipse will be visible across nearly all of the U.S. and a small portion of western Europe. During such a partial eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and does not completely cover it, resulting in the sun appearing to have a crescent shape.\n\nThe path of totality — when the moon completely covers the sun, creating a total eclipse, as previously reported — runs from Mexico (Sinaloa to Coahuila) to the United States (Texas to Maine) to Canada (Ontario to Newfoundland).\n\nLorewood Grove's Moritz Rosner is looking forward to teaching students about more aspects than an eye in the sky. She'll also aim to discuss elements from a darkening sky and temperature change, to phenomena like Baily’s beads and rippling shadow bands.\n\n\"We want to give them, 'Here's what to expect' because a lot is going to be happening in those two to three minutes,\" she said. \"We want to prepare them for what they're going to experience, so they can really recognize the true beauty.\"\n\nThinking about his Brandywine Springs middle-schoolers, decked out in their glasses, heading outside the Wilmington-area school — Peter Kelly just hopes for a clear, sunny day.\n\nAnd sparks of scientific curiosity.\n\n\"An eclipse is also a great phenomenon, where it's really trying to spark student curiosity and wonder,\" Kelly said. \"How does this happen? How do we know that we have these eclipses and predict when it's going to happen? It's an inspiration of curiosity. It kind of sparks that flame.\"\n\nTotal eclipse travel plans:Want to head out of town for a better view of the April solar eclipse?

This event is huge because there won't be another in the United States until 2044.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure everyone knows the facts about eclipses, because there are crazy myths floating around that have been debunked. We also share where to buy the appropriate eclipse glasses.\n\nPregnant women shouldn't watch an eclipse since it could hurt the baby\n\nThere's a false idea out there that harmful radiation is released from an eclipse, which has been debunked by NASA.\n\nGreg Weaver, manager of Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory in Hockessin, said this myth makes no sense.\n\n\"It's like saying, 'If you're pregnant, you shouldn't go out in the sun, because you might get a sunburn and it might hurt your pregnant child.' That's crazy,\" he explained.\n\nAn eclipse is a bad omen\n\nWhile an eclipse can seem eerie, they're not a sign of bad luck.\n\nWeaver said that superstition may stem from around 900 A.D. when ancient civilizations such as the Mayans used to accurately predict eclipses. They understood what are called the SAROS cycles, which are periods of the moon going around the earth.\n\n\"If you were like an astronomer and you failed to predict an eclipse, that was a death sentence, because that was your job,\" Weaver explained.\n\nNASA says the idea of eclipses being tied to bad omens is a classic case of \"confirmation basis,\" in which psychologists say we tend to remember moments when two things happened together but forget when they don't.\n\nOne example NASA gives is that King Henry I of England died in A.D. 1133, an event that coincided with a total solar eclipse.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can't happen at North or South Pole\n\nThe last total solar eclipse seen from the North Pole area was on March 20, 2015 and it passed over the North Pole itself and it came to an end exactly at the Spring Equinox, per NASA. The last total solar eclipse seen from the South Pole area was on Nov. 23, 2003.\n\nWeaver said a total solar eclipse is once again slated to pass over the North Pole area on Aug. 12, 2026 and will pass through parts of Iceland, Greenland and Siberia. In 2039, a total solar eclipse is headed to the South Pole and will pass over Antarctica, he added.\n\n\"They can happen anywhere,\" Weaver said about eclipses.\n\nTotal solar eclipse can make you blind\n\nYour eyes won't get damaged if you're in the direct path of a total eclipse and you're not wearing solar glasses during that phase because the sky will be too dark to see it, said Weaver, who is traveling to Indiana to witness the total eclipse on April 8, since Delaware will only experience a partial phase of the solar event.\n\nAt all other phases of a solar eclipse, proper precautions to protect your eyes from damage are needed.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' reports NASA on its website.\n\nSo why didn't Donald Trump go blind when he looked at the eclipse?\n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency in 2017, the internet buzzed when he observed a partial phase of a total eclipse from the White House balcony without protective glasses. Many questioned why he didn't suffer blindness from looking at the sun directly.\n\nWeaver said the answer is simple.\n\n\"It's just like looking at the sun on a sunny day. Try staring at the sun. You can't. Your blink reflexes will shut your eyes because it'll damage your eyes,\" explained Weaver, who traveled with his wife to Tennessee in 2017 to get a better view of the total eclipse.\n\nTo the Mt. Cuba expert's point, Trump squinted at the sun twice for a grand total of less than 2 seconds, before wearing his protective glasses.\n\nBut don't try this at home, kids. Experts advise that you keep your vision intact by using precautions such as eclipse glasses throughout the event.\n\n\"There's no word from the White House about whether Trump suffered eye damage, but he appeared to look up for only a brief moment,'' say the folks at Space.com. \"If you plan to look at the sun during an eclipse or at any other time, make sure you put on a pair of protective glasses or use a pinhole projector.''\n\nWill I need solar glasses for the total eclipse?\n\nMost people around the country will need to wear special eye protection to view the eclipse since most won't be in the path of totality, which is when the moon completely blocks the sun's bright face, NASA says.\n\n\"Except during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face, it is not safe to look directly at the Sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing,'' experts warn on the website.\n\nDelawareans will experience a partial eclipse, and this means the sun will be too bright to look at directly without using appropriate eye protection.\n\nEclipse glasses aren't regular sunglasses since they're \"thousands of times darker and ought to comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard,\" NASA says.\n\n\"Viewing any part of the bright Sun through a camera lens, binoculars, or a telescope without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics will instantly cause severe eye injury.''\n\nWhere can I buy eclipse glasses?\n\nWhile NASA reported it \"does not approve any particular brand of solar glasses,\" its website does link to the American Astronomical Society's website.\n\nThe AAS said several \"counterfeit eclipse glasses\" flooded the marketplace during the 2017 eclipse. In response to that, the AAS has a list of reputable sellers at eclipse.aas.org that people can vet.\n\nIn addition, the AAS says it doesn't recommend searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu, or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price. Instead, they recommend that people make sure that (1) the seller is identified on their AAS site and (2) the seller is listed on their page.\n\nWanna see the solar eclipse in Delaware?Here's where to check it out\n\nWant a better view of the solar eclipse?These places are good to see it out of state\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total eclipse in the US is Monday, April 8.\n\nIn Delaware:\n\nPartial eclipse begins at 2:07 p.m.\n\nMaximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nPartial eclipse ends at 4:34 p.m.\n\nThe total solar eclipse will be visible at 4:41 p.m., which only 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people, will be able to see worldwide in areas where the eclipse is visible.

He said they combined the trip to catch the sights and country music of Nashville.\n\n\"We happened to stay at a motel that was about five miles northwest of downtown, which turned out to be extremely significant,” Jack Slipe recalled. “[It] was a very warm and partly cloudy day. We found a good spot in an abandoned parking lot near the motel to watch the event. We were equipped with our eclipse glasses, my Canon AE-1 program camera, a tripod, and binoculars.\n\n\"As the eclipse started, we noticed the shadows cast by a nearby tree were in the shape of the crescent sun. Right before totality, we witnessed a very strange shimmering-like effect on the pavement of the lot. As soon as totality began, we ditched the glasses and were able to look directly up at the sun with our naked eyes and binoculars.\n\n\"It was absolutely amazing. It looked like a black hole up there in the sky. I took a few time-exposures with the camera, which revealed the blackened sun, a planet and some stars, and a nearby cloud which thankfully stayed a good distance away from the action. The temperature dropped significantly, and the birds stopped their chirping. As we looked around at the horizon, it looked like sunset from all 360 degrees. Once the sun emerged again, the excitement was over. We quickly packed up our gear and headed for the nearest golf course.\n\n\"We weren't aware of this fact until we watched the news later that evening, but in downtown Nashville, where thousands packed rooftop venues to get a glimpse of the eclipse, the skies were clouded over at the time of totality. Those poor people were 'left in the dark,' unable to view the spectacular event that we had just witnessed only a few miles away. How lucky we were!\"\n\nAsked for advice for first-timers, Slipe said it was best to arrive the day before rather than get caught in what may be congested traffic on eclipse day. It may already be too late to book a room, or by this time they might be severely overpriced. A wide-open area is ideal. \"This will allow you to see the extraordinary 'sunset' sky in all directions,\" he said. A leafy tree will allow one to see a myriad of tiny crescent suns cast onto the ground in the tree's shadow.\n\n\"Bring comfortable chairs, or a blanket if you are on the ground. And don't forget the eclipse glasses!\" he said.\n\nThey plan to see the upcoming eclipse from Erie. “Hopefully, we will be lucky enough to see it for a second time,\" Slipe said.\n\nMaria Francis\n\nMaria Francis and her family, who lived in East Stroudsburg at the time, viewed the 2017 eclipse from Kentucky. Francis is a Pocono Record reporter.\n\nTheir son Jordan, who was 15 then, had researched the eclipse and was intent on seeing it. Maria said that because it was so important to him and it would be a learning experience for him and the whole family, they decided to make it happen. Jordan picked the place: Hopkinsville, Kentucky.\n\nFortunately, it was a sunny day. They had no trouble getting there, she said, but it was so packed, for the trip home they were in traffic jam. Thousands of people shared the park where they were; those who did not plan ahead were parked along the roadway, lying on their cars looking up.\n\nPeople with bags of special solar eclipse glasses were handing them out. The Francis family — Maria, husband John, sons Jhonson and Jordan, daughter Serabi and their dog Sozin — were sprawled on a blanket on the grass, with a picnic lunch. Being ready with food is a good idea, she said; stores were selling out.\n\nAs the moon slowly covered the sun, she said, \"We were just waiting for the moment. Everybody froze. No one was talking. We watched its slow motion, and slowly watched it come back. Everybody was really awestruck; there were thousands of people, and everybody suddenly got quiet.\"\n\nThe moment totality was over, the masses burst into cheering. \"It was like a Happy New Year,\" she said.\n\nJordan, who is now a senior at Penn State, looks forward to traveling to Erie on April 8 to experience his second total solar eclipse. \"It is something you'd want to see if you got a chance.” he said. “It was just kind of like one of those little humbling moments that Mother Nature has where it feels like something is really off, but it is just how things are... It's ... almost like the end of the world thing as the sun is disappearing.\"\n\nJoseph Fluhr\n\nJoseph Fluhr, of Hawley, is a science teacher at Lehman Intermediate School in Dingmans Ferry and viewed the eclipse with his wife Jennine and their children, Jonathan, Peter, and Charlotte. They drove 12 and a half hours to see it from Harmony Retreat Center at Montvale, Tennessee.\n\nThere was a huge crowd, many checking out the partial phase with eclipse sunglasses.\n\nAt about 98%, \"there was only a tiny sliver of the sun left… You started to see some kind of yellowing — trees took on a yellow tint… you know something weird was going on,\" Fluhr said in an interview following his adventure with the 2017 eclipse.\n\nAn announcer explained what was happening in the sky. The crowd was busy with activities such as games and swimming.\n\n\"At that one moment everybody started looking at what they came for. With a few minutes to go, everything quieted down.\n\n“As it came in, it was very sudden. In a matter of 10 seconds it went from this yellow tint where you could [still] see everything, to just darkness… It was just ‘boom’…The sky went dark as the last sliver disappeared. You could hear the crowd just erupting.\n\n\"You instantly felt the temperature drop [10 to 15 degrees]. Then suddenly the breeze picked up. It was almost kind of like the end of the world, wrath of God-type of stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"The moon was the blackest black that you could possibly imagine. Take a black crayon and multiply it by 100, and that's the darkness of the moon at that moment. It was like a hole, a hole in the sky,\" Fluhr said.\n\n\"The horizon was amazing. It was kind of like a pale blue all around the horizon, with some orange above it and even a little bit of purple right above it- almost like a sunset in every direction you looked. And that light was coming from outside the circle of darkness.\n\n\"You could clearly hear the crickets, the katydids, all these little insects started thinking it was nighttime, doing their chirping thing,\" Fluhr said.\n\n“As that black hole started moving away… the disc [of the Moon] started moving away to the left side, you start seeing the diamond ring effect. It truly was marvelous. You see almost like a pin point spot, similar to the brightest star that you had ever seen… and then it just explodes in size, very rapidly. You want to look as much as you can, but at some point you start feeling it your eyes and you have to put your [eclipse] glasses back on.\n\n\"The crowd erupted and roared again. It was truly something to see.\"\n\nFluhr offered the following advice: Don’t miss enjoying the eclipse by being distracted trying to photograph it with a smartphone. There will be plenty of eclipse pictures; one might try holding the camera away and aim it at your eclipse-viewing companions for a special memory.\n\nPlan on “horrendous” traffic on the way, and even worse heading back. Have a plan.\n\nBe sure to be prepared to view the partial phase safely without hurting your eyes. Use solar eclipse glasses that have an ISO rating printed on the inside of the frame. Regular sunglasses, he said, are not adequate protection from the sun’s ultraviolet rays.\n\nEven if it clouds prevent seeing the total eclipse, it is not a total loss. Fluhr notes that the overcast sky will still become very dark for the length of totality, about three minutes.\n\nHe also advised looking for the side effects, including mysterious “shadow bands” that ripple across the landscape immediately before and after totality, and the noticeable temperature drop.\n\nFluhr said he hopes to see the upcoming eclipse from Lake Placid, New York.\n\nAs seen from the Poconos April 8, the sun will be about 95% covered. The approximate times for the eclipse as seen from this region are the beginning at 2:09 p.m., maximum at 3:24 p.m. and ending at 4:35 p.m.\n\nPlease send your reports of the coming eclipse to this writer, for a follow-up story.\n\nPeter Becker has worked at the Tri-County Independent or its predecessor publications since 1994.

The path of totality will cross the state from southwest to northeast, passing through cities like Cleveland, Akron and just outside Columbus. During the eclipse, the moon will completely block out the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth.\n\nNext April, Ohioans will get the chance to see the sun in a way that is not possible at any other time. Here are five things you need to know about the total solar eclipse in 2024.\n\nWhere will the total solar eclipse be visible in Ohio? See the map\n\nPeople within a 124-mile-wide band in Ohio will experience the rare total solar eclipse. The path of totality will cross the state from southwest to northeast, passing through cities such as Toledo, Bowling Green, Lima, Mansfield, Akron, Cleveland, Springfield and Dayton. The total eclipse will last for approximately three minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nA map from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio also shows the location and shape of the moon's shadow during the eclipse, with the shadow over Dayton and Lima, for instance, at 3:10 p.m. and over Akron and Cleveland at 3:15 p.m.\n\nWill you be able to see the solar eclipse in Columbus?\n\nYou may need to travel outside of Columbus to see the total solar eclipse, but a partial solar eclipse will be visible in Columbus.\n\nThe moon will be relatively closer to the Earth during the eclipse, which will make it larger and last longer. However, since Columbus is outside of the path of totality, the moon will not completely block out the sun. Instead, viewers will see a partial eclipse, with the moon covering a portion of the sun's disk. The sun will become about 99% obscured in Columbus during the peak of the eclipse.\n\nMeteor showers, supermoons and more:10 astronomical events to look for in 2023\n\nWhen was the last time a total eclipse was visible in Ohio?\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse will be the first time in over 200 years that people in Ohio will be able to see a total solar eclipse.\n\nOn average, a total solar eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth every 1.5 years. However, only 21 total solar eclipses have crossed the lower 48 states in the entire existence of the United States. The last total solar eclipse visible in Ohio was in 1806. The next total solar eclipse in Ohio will be in 2099.\n\nWhere can you attend solar eclipse viewing parties locally?\n\nPlaces like COSI, Ohio Wesleyan University's Perkins Observatory, Dawes Arboretum in Newark and Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks locations have hosted viewing parties and programming during past eclipses, so keep an eye out for details closer to the eclipse.\n\nThe state of Ohio has the website eclipse.ohio.gov with information including public parks and recreational areas that would be good for viewing the eclipse.\n\nWill I need glasses to view the eclipse?\n\nYou may already be aware that this isn't your first eclipse, but you will need glasses to view this phenomenon.\n\nSpecial eclipse glasses are necessary to filter out the harmful ultraviolet and infrared light from the sun. Eclipse glasses can be purchased at many stores or can be ordered online. The eclipse can also be viewed through telescopes, binoculars and cameras with solar filters and pinhole or similar projection methods.\n\nIt is never safe to look directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse. This also applies during a total eclipse up until the sun is completely blocked, so it will be important to know when to take off and put back glasses.\n\ntmoorman@dispatch.com\n\n@taijuannichole", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/08/16/here-where-watch-eclipse-delaware/570440001/", "title": "Here is where to watch the eclipse in Delaware", "text": "Ken Mammarella\n\nSpecial to The News Journal\n\nNOTE: This story has been altered to say that there will be a limited number of eclipse glasses available at the Brandywine Library.\n\nDelaware isn’t one of the 14 states who will see the complete solar eclipse Monday, but many places are hosting viewing parties.\n\nSuch events will add to the science and the fun, and they’re likely to offer equipment to make viewing safer.

Here's what to know ...", "text": "If you're planning to gaze upon the upcoming Great American Eclipse in April through run-of-the-mill sunglasses, you're doing it wrong.\n\nIn the face of the sun's powerful rays, regular specs made of cheap plastic and polycarbonate material just aren't going to cut it – and neither will most welding lenses, for that matter. That's why astronomers and other experts emphasize that skygazers intent on viewing the upcoming total solar eclipse do so with specialized eyewear crafted to protect their sensitive retinas from permanent damage.\n\nFortunately, solar eclipse glasses are readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet. Just make sure you get certified spectacles before the eclipse cuts a long path April 8 across North America, shrouding much of the U.S. in darkness.\n\nBefore the big day arrives, here's what to know about solar eclipse glasses and where you can get a pair of your own, as well as other eclipse-viewing methods.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nDo you need protective glasses to watch the solar eclipse?\n\nThe sun's powerful rays can burn the eyes and damage the retinas of those who don't wear proper eye protection or take other safety precautions to view solar eclipses.\n\nEven viewing any part of the bright sun through camera lenses, binoculars and telescopes without a specialized solar filter could instantly cause severe eye injury, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nUnlike other solar eclipses, a much more rare total eclipse offers spectators a chance to gaze upon the spectacular sight with the naked eye after the orbiting moon completely blocks out the sun's light, leaving only the outermost layer visible.\n\nBut until that moment, spectators will need proper eyewear just like they would for any other eclipse.\n\nNASA advises skygazers to plan accordingly and ensure they have the safe, and simple, equipment needed for solar viewing.\n\nYou'll know it's safe to fully take in the dazzling display when the moon – which is close enough in its orbit of Earth to appear as large as the sun – blocks the sun's face and the sky turns to night time. That's when \"totality\" occurs, whereby observers can see the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere known as the corona.\n\nWhere to find solar eclipse glasses\n\nSo how are solar eclipse glasses different from that pair of Ray-Bans you have?\n\nWell, they let in entirely too much light than is safe for our eyes when looking directly at the sun. Certified eyewear, on the other hand, is held to an international safety standard and is 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nOften made with a polyester film coated in aluminum, the glasses are highly specialized but also ridiculously common and easy to find – if you know where to look. As the eclipse approaches, many places like local libraries, astronomical observatories, schools and other public agencies will provide proper eyewear, often for free.\n\nBut we live in the age of the internet economy, and many people may be looking to simply order a pair online for a hassle-free delivery. Fortunately, you're in luck there, too.\n\nMany eclipse websites like GreatAmericanEclipse.com and NationalEclipse.com sell a variety of eyewear products, along with plenty of other gadgets one may need to see the eclipse.\n\nOf course, Amazon and plenty of other online retailers are also selling solar eclipse glasses in bulk, meaning you'll have plenty to share with your friends and family. American Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, even offers express shipping across the country.\n\nPurchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nHow to make sure solar eclipse glasses are safe\n\nThere's one caveat to all this as you do your eclipse glasses shopping: There are plenty of fakes and imitators out there, so make sure you're buying a proper certified pair.\n\nDon't worry: It's easier to verify your purchase than you may think. For your convenience, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors. In preparation for the upcoming eclipse primarily concentrated in North America, the organization has updated its list to give priority to North American manufacturers.\n\nThe organization, which ensures eclipse glasses are in compliance with the International Organization for Standardization, says most approved vendors use solar filters manufactured by AstroSolar and Thousand Oaks Optical, according to Space.com. Regardless, your best bet is to look for a product that is labeled with \"ISO,\" a surefire sign that the independent organization vouches for the product's safety and quality.\n\nTo be ISO-approved, solar eclipse glasses have to meet a host of requirements, the most important of which arguably pertains to how much of the sun's light is able to transmit through the filters.\n\nWhen shopping Amazon or other retailers, look elsewhere if a seller's name is not one of the verified suppliers on the American Astronomical Society's list.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses alternatives\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society offers helpful instructions to set them up.\n\nMaking one doesn't even require any special equipment – just some common household items.\n\nWith the sun at your back, make sure its light passes through a small opening – a hole punch in an index card, a pasta colander, or even your own outstretched fingers – onto the ground or another surface. The little spaces will project a grid of small images on the ground that, during the partial phases of a solar eclipse, will reveal the sun's crescent shape.\n\nThen of course, when it suddenly gets dark, it will be safe to look directly at the eclipsed sun if you can find a spot to see it on the path of totality.\n\nThe lenses and mirrors of telescopes and binoculars can also be used to optically project a magnified image of the sun onto a piece of paper.\n\nThis method provides bigger and brighter images when compared to pinhole projection but can be dangerous both to the devices and those using them. As such, it is only recommended for experienced astronomical observers, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nOther methods include handmade sun funnels, as well as the pricey Sunspotters and Solarscopes, which are better-suited for groups like astronomy clubs, schools, museums and planetariums.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Moon's tilted orbit is the key.\n\nProtect your eyes and your phone\n\nMuch the same way one should protect their eyes when watching the eclipse by wearing eclipse glasses, one should protect their phone when taking pictures of it.\n\nFor taking casual photos with a phone before or after totality, use solar film or hold eclipse glasses over the lens to protect it. It is easier to keep the protection on during totality, but just as eclipse glasses can be removed from your eyes during totality, the same goes for phone lenses.\n\nRemember to protect both your eyes and your phone. If you are viewing from an area where totality will be reached, eye and lens protection can be removed during those two to four minutes of totality.\n\nIf you are using a telescope or binoculars with a phone, use a solar filter to protect against concentrated sunlight.\n\nSamsung recommends using a solar filter when taking longer exposures during the event when using its phones.\n\nPractice ahead of time\n\nBefore the eclipse arrives, test any gear — tripods, lens protection, apps, etc. — you plan to use that day. The window to see the moon's shadow is small so you don't want the experience to be felled by technical glitches.\n\n\"You think, 'Oh, I'm gonna be like, super prepared,' but it is a big rush,\" Carly Stocks, a Utah-based astronomical photographer told USA TODAY. \"So you want to have a plan and practice.\"\n\nYou can also use apps, such as PhotoPills, to plan locations and time photos.\n\nLook around for photo opportunities beyond the eclipse itself\n\nThere will be many people taking pictures of the eclipse itself so it might be wise to turn your lens away from where everyone else is pointing theirs.\n\nTake photos of people observing the eclipse and the scene of any eclipse gatherings. This will connect the human and astral experiences.\n\nIf you find yourself in a spot where there are few people present, try putting the eclipse in context using the surrounding structures or nature as a frame.\n\nDon't try to capture an eclipse selfie\n\nWith a proper solar filter, you can capture the sun with the front camera lens during the solar eclipse, but it won't make the best selfie.\n\nStocks said the camera will have trouble focusing on both you and the sun. She recommends taking a photo focusing on each and blending the two together with editing software.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/18/pregnant-during-eclipse-superstitions-say-could-harm-baby/579196001/", "title": "Pregnant during the eclipse? Superstitions say it could harm the baby", "text": "Just in case pregnant women don't have enough to worry about, there are some legends warning them of harm during an eclipse.\n\nAztecs believed a lunar eclipse was a result of a bite being taken out of the moon. This idea translated into the Mexican superstition that if a pregnant woman viewed an eclipse, a bite would be taken out of her unborn child's face. Hindu text credits the eclipse to the head of the demon Rahu, who ate the moon or sun.\n\nHere are a few superstitions to know before the solar eclipse Aug. 21.\n\nDo not go outside during the eclipse. It's believed pregnant women who are in the presence of the eclipse could cause their baby to have facial deformities or birth marks. While there isn’t a proven reason why women who are expecting shouldn’t go outside during the event, there is merit to not looking at the eclipse with bare eyes. “Eclipse blindness” is a real thing. It’s never safe for anyone to view the sun for any length of time with a naked eye, because it could permanently damage the retina. (There are eclipse glasses that are certified as safe for viewing the eclipse. But, if you haven't bought glasses by now, you might not find a pair.) There are no proven eclipse-related health concerns specific to pregnant women or their babies.\n\nDon’t wear metal. Avoid wearing sari pins, hair pins and jewelry, AstroSage, an India-based astrology site advises. Superstitions say this might also cause facial birth defects.\n\nDo wear metal, and red underwear. Yup, this one goes against the previous idea. Mexican superstitions say wearing a safety pin (traditionally, a woman might have held a knife close to her belly) and red underwear offers protection against a cleft palette. While the cause of a cleft palate is unknown, there have been no proven links to eclipses during pregnancy.\n\nMore:After Aug. 21 eclipse, Earth will be destroyed by rogue planet Nibiru, says iffy doomsayer\n\nMore:Interdimensional creatures, aliens and Earth's destruction: Solar eclipse generates wild theories\n\nMore:The solar eclipse is going to confuse animals — a lot\n\nDo not use a knife or any sharp weapon to cut fruits and vegetables. Indian astrology warns this could cause the unborn baby to develop a cleft organ, also not proven.\n\nLie straight in bed. Shafia Bhutto, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Mercy Hospital in St. Louis, told the St. Louis Post Dispatch women in Pakistan might be told this to prevent a baby from developing crooked joints. \"There is nothing that will happen to your unborn baby during an eclipse because they are in your uterus,” Bhutto told the Dispatch.\n\nPray, fast and bathe.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nMillions of Americans will be looking to the sky during a rare total solar eclipse on April 8, and experts warn the excitement could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions as people pack into the narrow band of the country with the best view.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally, people will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokesperson for the American Automobile Association.\n\nRoads could be especially packed at the center of the eclipse's path as Americans who want the best view crowd into cities, towns and remote areas, many without the infrastructure to handle big crowds.\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse, where congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after the totality of the eclipse, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests that the worst of the traffic – both on big interstates and rural backroads – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to exit all at once.\n\nThis year, in Ohio's Lorain County, county officials are warning residents to be aware about the increase in visitors, traffic and jammed roads – and possible cellphone signal drops.\n\n“What we could have is crowds here that we’re not used to,” wrote Dave Freeman, the director of Lorain County Emergency Management. “We’re not set up infrastructure-wise for that, we don’t have the roads.”\n\nEclipse forecast:Will the 2024 eclipse still look good if it's cloudy? What to know about cloud forecasts.\n\nWhere will traffic be the worst during 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nRoads in states where sky gazers will travel to see the centerline of totality will be most prone to traffic jams.\n\nEven though Oklahoma only has a small corner of the state in the path of totality, the state \"is expected to receive an influx of anywhere from 17,000 to 66,000 visitors to watch the solar eclipse,\" reads an announcement from Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Officials there are warning residents \"the large influx of visitors to southeastern Oklahoma could overwhelm and backup the area's road systems,\" including two-lane highways passing through small towns.\n\nThey advise residents to expect hotels and visiting areas at maximum capacity, increased traffic and delays in deliveries.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse snarled US traffic\n\nWyoming Department of Transportation spokesman Doug McGee said more than 536,000 cars filled the state's streets after the eclipse in 2017 and the state highway system \"was taxed like it’s never been before,\" The Denver Post reported.\n\nAnd \"travel from Casper, Wyoming, to Denver, Colorado – normally a 4-hour trip – took 10 hours or more,\" according to an analysis of traffic from Transportation Research News.\n\nThe analysis' author Jonathan Upchurch said most sky gazers traveled to the paths of totality by car, \"roadways experienced very little traffic congestion on the days leading up to totality\" and \"almost every Interstate route passing through the path of totality showed red on Google Traffic maps\" after the eclipse reached totality.\n\nThe 2017 traffic woes followed warnings from officials.\n\nBe careful if you're driving during the eclipse\n\nTexas state officials are also warning drivers to \"be on alert for distracted pedestrians looking to the sky.\" They also say drivers should not wear eclipse glasses, which block out most light, while driving.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?Search your ZIP code for a viewing guide\n\nOfficials there and elsewhere along the solar eclipse's line of totality are recommending drivers keep their headlights on, be mindful of pedestrians on the road and even stock up on essentials like fuel and food ahead of the eclipse.\n\nAAA, which insures drivers across the country, is also warning people that sky gazers looking for a good view of the eclipse will be on the roads. They recommend drivers put their sun visors in their cars down to block their view of the sun and watch closely for pedestrian traffic.\n\nHow should Americans prepare for traffic jams?\n\nAAA and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol suggest several ways Americans can prepare for traffic jams related to the solar eclipse:\n\nPlan ahead so you don't have to travel for errands or appointments around when the eclipse is happening.\n\nDon't pull over on the side of a road or highway to view the eclipse. Find a parking area instead.\n\nFuel up before the eclipse and have some essentials on hand while traveling.\n\nWhen and where can you view the 2024 total solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light, leading to a period of partial or full darkness on Earth.\n\nThe path of totality, where the sun is fully blocked, in the U.S. begins in Texas and the eclipse starts around 1:27 p.m. local time.\n\nCities on the centerline of the April 8 eclipse include Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nContributing: Ashley May, Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla and Ahjané Forbes, USA TODAY\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

Probably ...", "text": "If certified eyewear to watch the impending total solar eclipse is becoming hard to come by, many would-be skygazers may be tempted to find other alternative methods to witness the spectacular sight.\n\nAnd if you're a welder, you may think you've already got just the perfect piece of equipment in your workshop. But beware: Experts warn that those old reliable welding goggles you've got sitting on a shelf likely aren't capable of adequately withstanding the sun's powerful rays and protecting your vulnerable eyes.\n\nAny welding lenses weaker than a Shade 12 filter – a number that indicates the level of protection offered – just aren't going to cut it when it comes to gazing skyward on April 8 in anticipation of the moon blocking all but the sun's outermost layer.\n\nHere's what to know about how to ensure your welding helmets or goggles are safe for viewing the total solar eclipse.\n\n2024 total solar eclipse guide:How to watch, understand and stay safe on April 8\n\nAre welding helmets or goggles ever safe to view a total solar eclipse?\n\nMost people don't go around during the day looking up at the sun for any extended period of time – at least, not without significantly impairing their vision.\n\nBut a total solar eclipse is a rare and stunning enough of an event that millions of people across the United States are going to want to do just that on April 8.\n\nFortunately, safety glasses make it possible for spectators to gaze up at the sun to catch the moment of totality, whereby the moon passes in front of it and appears large enough to us on Earth to completely block the sun's light. That moment also offers skygazers an uncommon glimpse of the sun's outermost layer known as the corona.\n\nWhile certified solar eclipse glasses are the preferred method for viewing the eclipse, alternative methods do exist that don't necessarily sacrifice one's safety.\n\nHowever, most welding lenses aren't dark enough to serve as adequate protection, according to Phillips Safety, a manufacturer of occupational safety products. Welding glasses with the darkest shade level of 14 serve as the best protection, but are uncommon and not widely available in most neighborhood hardware stores, Phillips Safety said.\n\nInteractive maps:How long will the solar eclipse darkness last in your city?\n\nWhat to know about shades and filters on welding lenses\n\nThe shade level on welding goggles typically ranges from 4 to 14, with the lenses being darker the higher the number.\n\nAccording to NASA, any welding lenses that are at least a Shade 12 are safe for viewing a total solar eclipse, but because most types of welding don't require eyewear with filters that dark, they're hard to come by.\n\nWhat's more, most people may still find the sun too bright with a Shade 12 pair of goggles, while Shade 14 protection may make it too dim, NASA said.\n\nPhillips warns against using welding glasses without a marking that designates the shading level unless you're confident you're not taking an unnecessarily risky gamble. The manufacturer, which advertises Welding Glasses Shade 14 for sale on its website, says the eyewear is made of material much darker than solar eclipse glasses designed to block out all visible light except for a small amount of green light.\n\nWelding helmets of Shade 12 and higher are also available for sale through Tractor Supply, which the company is promoting as a viable option for viewing the eclipse at any of its 282 stores along the path of totality. Though the company claimed in press material provided to USA TODAY that the helmets are NASA-certified,\" it's important for consumers to remember that the space agency does not give its seal of approval to any particular products.\n\nHowever, the American Astronomical Society maintains a list of reputable vendors of solar eclipse viewers that doesn't include any suppliers of welder's filters.\n\nMove over, 2017 solar eclipse:Here's why the 2024 event will be bigger and better.\n\nHow to find ISO certified solar eclipse glasses\n\nCertified eyewear that is specially designed to safely take in a solar eclipse remains the best bet for those intent on witnessing the last one of these incredible astronomical events in North America for 20 years.\n\nBut with the total solar eclipse less than two weeks away, it's time to start checking local libraries, astronomical observatories, schools and other public agencies that may be giving away eclipse glasses for free. Many eclipse websites like GreatAmericanEclipse.com and NationalEclipse.com also sell a variety of eyewear products, along with plenty of other gadgets one may need to see the eclipse.\n\nCrafted to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light, these glasses are much stronger than regular ol' sunglasses. Just be warned: Plenty of fakes and imitators exist.\n\nThe real deal are in compliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which mandates that to be verified, only a certain amount of sunlight can transmit through the filters. Fortunately, the astronomical society makes it easy to check a potential purchase with its aforementioned curated list of vendors.\n\nWhat makes a total eclipse unique compared to partial solar eclipses is that the millions of people who witness it in the United States will have an opportunity to safely gaze upon the sight with the naked eye. That moment will come when totality occurs and the moon ushers in darkness by blocking the sun's disk.\n\nHundreds of cities in 13 states are on the path of totality for this year's solar eclipse, which will pass from southwest to northeast across North America.

Sonic also invites guests to head to their local Sonic location to watch the eclipse while enjoying their Blackout Slush.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon appears as the same size as the sun and blocks the entire disk from Earth, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" whereby observers can see the outmost layer of the sun's atmosphere known as the corona, confuses animals – causing nocturnal creatures to stir and bird and insects to fall silent.\n\nWhen and where to see the April 8 total solar eclipse\n\nOn April 8, the potentially once-in-a-lifetime total solar eclipse will chart a 115-mile-wide path of totality across portions of Mexico the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states lie along the path. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path, while millions more tourists are already making travel plans – sure to snarl traffic – to catch a glimpse of what is sure to be a spectacular sight, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending it's time in the U.S. around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine and entering Canada's maritime provinces, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes. And as if the dazzling solar eclipse won't be enough, there's a small chance that the horned \"devil comet\" may make an appearance that same day as it makes its closest orbital approach to Earth later in the month.\n\nIf you want to see the time and duration for when totality would occur near each of these locations, see these interactive maps.\n\nWhy is this year's total solar eclipse special?\n\nThe last time North Americans witnessed a total solar eclipse in 2017, the sun's activity was at a minimum.\n\nThis time around, though, the sun will be at the peak activity of an 11-year solar cycle, making its elusive corona especially visible, astronomers say.\n\nMeanwhile, the moon will be closer to Earth than it was seven years ago, making it appear larger in the sky and increasing the length that darkness will last in many places, according to eclipse2024.org.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/27/2024-eclipse-food-deals/73104573007/", "title": "Solar eclipse food deals at Pizza Hut, Burger King, Applebee's more", "text": "The upcoming total eclipse is not just a time to witness a celestial phenomenon.

Millions of people are expected to travel to see it, which will also attract scientists from across the country to study its unique effects on the Earth and its atmosphere.\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality can still use eclipse glasses (maybe free eclipse glasses) to see the moon pass in front of the sun.\n\nThat is, if clouds don't get in the way.\n\nWhere are clear skies most likely?\n\nWithin the path of totality, the best chances for clear viewing are in \"northern New England and from southern Missouri to central Indiana,\" the Weather Prediction Center said Friday.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast office in Burlington, Vermont, said \"sky cover is still looking mostly sunny for eclipse day on Monday.\" In New York State, the Albany office confirmed the good forecast: \"We have good news for those wishing to view the eclipse. Very pleasant spring weather conditions arrive just in time for the start of the new work week and the day of the Great North American Solar Eclipse.\"\n\nWhere might clouds spoil the view?\n\nBased on past weather patterns, the Hill Country of Texas was supposed to be the ideal location for eclipse viewing: Texas' typically sunny weather, major cities such as Austin and San Antonio that are ready for tourists, and location under the path of totality all combined to make it an easy recommendation for people willing to travel.\n\nBut those hopes appear to be dashed as of Friday.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Austin/San Antonio said that widespread clouds are likely in that part of Texas Monday afternoon, and that \"for now eclipse viewability through the cloud cover is expected to be poor.\"\n\nIn addition to clouds, AccuWeather says that portions of Texas will have to endure stormy weather on Monday: \"Showers and drenching thunderstorms can occur across east Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley on Monday and slowly move northward into southern Oklahoma later in the day and night. Some of the heavier storms can produce flooding, hail, and brief strong wind gusts.\"\n\nWhat about around the Great Lakes?\n\nElsewhere, the Weather Prediction Center said that \"cloud cover in the path of totality is also possible for portions of Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania, and far western New York.\"\n\nThe weather service in Cleveland offered a modicum of hope: \"Exact details for the April 8, 2024 eclipse remain uncertain, although confidence is medium to high that the area will not experience completely opaque/overcast skies.\"\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path. You can search by zip code to find the exact time for your location.\n\nMonday’s solar eclipse path of totality may not be exact\n\nA new map is projecting that the path of totality for Monday's solar eclipse may be narrower than experts previously believed. But if you're right on the edge of the path, don't go changing your plans just yet.\n\nNew amateur calculations suggest that widely-accepted path could be off by as much as just a few hundred yards. The potential shift in the eclipse's path is so miniscule, in fact, that a NASA spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that the U.S. space agency won't be making any alterations to its own calculations.\n\nSo, even if the new calculation is more accurate, it’s unlikely to matter much for most of the millions of skygazers who hope to witness the first total solar eclipse in North America in seven years.\n\nThe new eclipse calculations come courtesy of John Irwin, a member of the team of amateur astronomers analyzing the celestial event for the Besselian Elements.\n\nBut don't fret too much: Not only is the new analysis not yet peer-reviewed, but NASA told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, that its predictions have not changed.\n\nHowever, NASA spokesman Tiernan Doyle acknowledged \"a tiny but real uncertainty about the size of the sun\" could lead to a narrower eclipse path.\n\nMore celestial wonders on the way: 'Devil comet,' Lyrid meteor shower, pink moon also visible in April\n\nThe eclipse isn't the only sky spectacle to look forward to this month: From a \"devil comet\" to a stunning pink moon, a few other celestial events will give skygazers plenty of reason to look up in April once the total solar eclipse has come and gone Monday.\n\nWhile the famed \"devil comet\" may be visible during the solar eclipse itself, astronomers say that the celestial body will be best sighted on April 21. That's the day that the comet, officially known as 12P/Pons-Brooks, will make its closest approach to the sun.\n\nThe comet earned its demonic nickname from its distinctive tail that resembles horns.\n\nThe Lyrid meteor shower will also make its annual appearance this month, with its peak on April 21-22. The Lyrids, one of the oldest-known meteor showers on record, has reliably peaked every year in late April like clockwork for thousands of years.\n\nFinally, the full pink moon will rise in the evening sky on April 23. This month's full moon name comes from the moss pink wildflower that sprouts this time of year.\n\nCan you drive during a solar eclipse?\n\nIt's safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to find a safe place to park and then wear your eclipse glasses to view the eclipse.\n\nAuthorities are also reminding people to not drive while wearing solar eclipse glasses. Eclipse glasses are designed specifically for viewing an eclipse and you would not be able to see the road adequately while wearing them.\n\nOwls may hoot and bats may fly during the eclipse, but don't expect coyotes to howl\n\nWe human beings are giddy with excitement for the upcoming eclipse on Monday, but what about the animals? It's safe to say they don't even know it's coming. How will they react when the moon blots out the sun and it gets dark?\n\n\"It will be a complete surprise to our wildlife, but we do know from other parts of the world some will assume it's nighttime all of a sudden,\" said Toni Mikula, a fish and wildlife scientist with Vermont Fish & Wildlife. \"Birds hurrying to go to roost. Owls starting to hoot or you might see some bats come out. Three minutes later the sun will start to rise again. Everybody will go back to normal.\"\n\nMikula doesn't expect anything overly dramatic, like coyotes beginning to howl. But she'll be monitoring reactions near her home during the eclipse.\n\n\"I'm fortunate, I have a pretty good view of the sky from my house,\" Mikula said. \"The state is encouraging people to stay home that day. I will be outside listening to see if any owls come out to hoot.\"\n\nNew York inmates who claimed lockdown was religious violation will be able to see eclipse\n\nInmates at a New York prison who sued the state corrections department over a planned lockdown during the eclipse will be able to see the celestial event after all.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in upstate New York claimed that the lockdown, which would have prevented many statewide inmates from witnessing Monday's solar eclipse, constituted a violation of religious rights.\n\n\"For many, this eclipse is a moment of monumental religious significance that cannot be overlooked or dismissed out of hand,\" according to the lawsuit, which listed six plaintiffs of various religious faiths.\n\nCorrections officials agreed Thursday to permit the plaintiffs – a Baptist, a Muslim, a Seventh-Day Adventist, two practitioners of Santeria and an atheist – to view the eclipse in exchange for the lawsuit's dismissal, department spokesman Thomas Mailey told USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/01/17/free-sonic-for-teachers/72259316007/", "title": "Sonic has free food, drinks for teachers and school staff this week", "text": "Teacher appreciation week arrives early at Sonic.\n\nThe restaurant chain is offering new rewards exclusively to educators across the U.S from Tuesday Jan 16. to Friday Jan. 19 that change each day.\n\n\"SONIC is proud to express its appreciation for the tireless efforts of educators as they inspire children throughout the year,\" the chain said in a news release.\n\nThe chain said the deal is their latest example of their effort to support public education.
