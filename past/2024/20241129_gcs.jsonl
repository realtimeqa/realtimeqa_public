The Paramount Pictures film is the sequel to a movie that won the best picture Oscar two decades ago. The film, released last weekend outside the U.S., had an overall box office tally of $221 million.\n\n\"Gladiator II\" stars Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington in a story of political intrigue that unfolds 16 years after the original film.\n\n'Gladiator 2' review:Yes, we are entertained again by outrageous sequel\n\nThe two films, dubbed \"Glicked\" by fans, brought in $169.5 million at domestic theaters, helping lift the weekend box office to $201.9 million. It's the highest-grossing weekend in North America since the July opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" according to Comscore.\n\n\"Glicked\" fell short of the $245 million \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" opening frenzy in July 2023, which showed that the industry was rebounding from the pandemic and strikes that year by writers and actors.\n\nStill, the two films delivered a much-needed jolt to movie theaters, after anticipated fall films such as \"Joker: Folie a Deux\" and \"Venom: The Last Dance\" underperformed at the box office.\n\nThe fervor was a positive sign for theater chains such as AMC Entertainment, Cineplex and Cinemark that are looking ahead to another major release, Walt Disney's animated \"Moana 2\" this week.\n\n\"This is a tremendous catalyst for a strong box office going into December and the New Year,\" said National Association of Theatre Owners President and CEO Michael O’Leary.\n\nMovie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada have hovered below pre-pandemic levels as cinemas grapple with competition from streaming and the disruptions from last year's Hollywood strikes.\n\nFact-checking 'Gladiator II':Were there really sharks in the Colosseum?\n\nSunday's tallies brought year-to-date domestic ticket sales to $7.3 billion, down 10.6% from the same time in 2023, according to Comscore. Studios and theater owners are hopeful that \"Moana 2\" will lead next weekend to the strongest Thanksgiving-period sales in history.\n\nBox office analysts say ticket sales from Thanksgiving through the end of the year could rank as the biggest in cinema history. The holiday season record of $2.5 billion was set in 2017, led by the \"Star Wars\" film \"The Last Jedi.\"\n\n\"This is the best possible news for movie theaters, this lineup of films, starting with 'Glicked' and 'Moana 2,'\" said Paul Dergarabedian, media analyst for Comscore.\n\n'Wicked' review:Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande are fantastic as witchy BFFs\n\nUniversal, a unit of Comcast, spent roughly $160 million to make the first \"Wicked\" movie, a sum that does not include tens of millions more for marketing ranging from a Super Bowl ad to hundreds of \"Wicked\" products.\n\nIn a campaign reminiscent of the hoopla surrounding \"Barbie,\" \"Wicked\" tie-ins include pink and green drinks at Starbucks, a fashion line at Target and a Betty Crocker cupcake mix.\n\n\"This campaign was just everywhere. It was just inescapable,\" said Jim Orr, Universal Pictures' president of domestic theatrical distribution. \"And on top of all of that, we had the hardest-working cast that you could have.

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}]}

Will a crew soon fly to the Outback Space Station, link up to the Home Depot docking port and float into the Merck Laboratory Module to perform experiments? How about a McDonald's moon base?\n\nIf NASA chief Jim Bridenstine gets his way, all of that could be possible.\n\nBridenstine wants the space agency to explore the feasibility of selling naming rights for rockets and spacecraft as part of an effort to speed up the commercialization of low Earth orbit and free up money for deep space exploration. He'd also like to raise astronauts' profiles and potentially enable them to profit from endorsements, just like athletes.\n\n“I’d like to see kids growing up instead of maybe wanting to be like a professional sports star, I’d like to see them grow up wanting to be a NASA astronaut or a NASA scientist,” Bridenstine told the NASA Advisory Council recently. “I’d like to see maybe one day NASA astronauts on the cover of a cereal box, embedded into the American culture.”\n\nSept. 26:NASA spots silent Mars Opportunity rover from space\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nSept. 25:This is why the Earth wobbles as it spins, according to NASA\n\nIt’s not a completely new idea: Brands have been associated with spaceflight since the dawn of the Space Age, marketing everything from Tang to Corvettes to TV dinners, pens and watches.\n\nThere was talk in the '90s of big commercial sponsorship deals that went nowhere. Mike McCulley, a retired shuttle pilot and former CEO of United Space Alliance, remembers interest from Kellogg in emblazoning Tony the Tiger on the shuttle’s giant orange fuel tank. But he said such talk never moved beyond brainstorming.\n\nExperts say a fresh look at the laws and policies that prohibit astronauts from any product endorsement deal, including limiting which commercial experiments they’re allowed to work on in orbit, could be worthwhile and generate some additional cash for the agency.\n\n“The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert immediately poked fun at the branding concept, with a spoof of Neil Armstrong declaring, “That’s one small step for man, one comfortable leap thanks to Dr. Scholl’s insoles! Houston, I’m gellin’!”\n\nPlaying along, Bridenstine responded with a tweet asking whether “The Tonight Show” would like to brand a rocket instead.\n\nSept. 17:SpaceX announces Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as first 'private passenger' on moon rocket\n\nSept. 14:SpaceX signs first private passenger for rocket mission around the moon\n\n“Jimmy Fallon, you in?” the NASA administrator wrote, showing Fallon’s image emblazoned on the nose cone of a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket then preparing to launch a NASA science mission from California.\n\nTo pave the way toward this final branding frontier, Bridenstine has created a new advisory committee to figure out what's possible. The committee will look at any regulatory obstacles to commercial progress in low Earth orbit. The goal of Mike Gold, the head of the committee: to help NASA \"achieve escape velocity from red tape.\"\n\nBridenstine's proposal comes at a time when billionaire-backed private space companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic dominate the buzz about spaceflight and are growing closer to flying space tourists. So far, it's unclear whether the proposed branding strategy would apply to NASA-owned rockets and spacecraft, or only to missions flown by commercial companies, such as SpaceX.\n\nWithin a year, NASA astronauts will begin flying to the International Space Station on NASA contracted \"Commercial Crew\" capsules operated by Boeing and SpaceX. The capsules will have extra seats that could be filled by private astronauts or wealthy tourists not bound by NASA's restrictions on sponsorship and endorsements.\n\nAug. 28:Astronaut candidate resigns from NASA for first time in 50 years\n\nAug. 27:NASA chief: 'Without question,' U.S. rockets will launch astronauts from U.S. soil next year\n\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration wants to end direct federal support for the space station in 2025, hoping commercial space companies will take it over or field new stations that promote research and commerce in low Earth orbit. NASA wants to focus on returning humans to the moon.\n\nWould the branding really make a difference to NASA's finances? Future flights of NASA’s Space Launch System rocket are expected to run at least $1 billion each launch. The shuttle was only a fraction of that, and McCulley said corporate sponsorship then probably would have only generated \"pennies in the overall scheme of things.”\n\nThen there are questions like, where would the revenue from naming rights or an astronaut’s image on a Wheaties cereal box go? Who would decide? Who would negotiate the agreements?\n\n“There’s a lot of opportunities for sponsorship, and I am not dismissing it outright, but it also opens up a Pandora’s box of issues – around flight safety, around undue influence, around go/no-go decisions and the timing of flights,” said Richard Jurek, co-author of \"Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program.\"\n\nLiability is another concern.\n\nIn 2000, Pizza Hut paid $1 million to put its new logo on a Russian Proton rocket that launched an early space station module. The launch was a success, but what if it had gone badly? Would anyone want to accept such risks on missions carrying people?\n\nThen there's the potential for a commercial advertiser to influence critical judgment calls and impact safety.\n\nJurek wonders whether sponsorships would open the door to second-guessing mission controllers or astronauts.\n\nAug. 22:Would-be NASA intern loses gig after vulgar tweet to NASA alum Homer Hickam, reports say\n\nAug. 21:Scientists discover ice on the moon using NASA tool, say it could help future space missions\n\n\"Are they making a decision based on money and their ability to promote their sponsor, or the true life-and-death decision they have to make at the time?\" he said.\n\nGreed and abuse are other considerations. Companies might seek an edge in contract bids by buying naming rights or doling out astronaut endorsements.\n\nPerceptions of astronauts abusing the privilege of representing the nation in space by profiting personally are behind some of the current restrictions. Apollo 15 astronauts prompted a congressional investigation after flying to the moon and signing first-day postal covers for a German stamp dealer who promised to pay them. Congress only recently passed a law awarding Apollo and earlier astronauts ownership and the right to sell personal artifacts and mementos that NASA had tried to reclaim.\n\nBridenstine argues that limitations on astronauts have diminished their visibility and stature as American heroes.\n\nDespite the potential pitfalls, advertising is seen as an inevitable and essential way for private companies to one day make money in space – a future NASA wants to accelerate.\n\n\n\n“Brands are part of our culture here on Earth, so why shouldn’t they be a part of the culture we take away from Earth?” asked Robert Pearlman, editor of CollectSpace.com.\n\nFollow James Dean on Twitter: @flatoday_jdean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/27"}]}

Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\nSecret Service agents stand at the gate of Mar-a-Lago after the FBI executed a search warrant at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate, August 8, 2022. Damon Higgins/AP\n\nThe Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to the former President, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents.\n\nThe search began early Monday morning and law enforcement personnel appeared to be focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe FBI’s search included examining where documents were kept, according to another person familiar with the investigation, and boxes of items were taken. Following the National Archives’ recovering of White House records from Mar-a-Lago in recent months, the FBI on Monday had to verify that nothing was left behind.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former FBI official shares what struck him about FBI search 02:03 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s son, Eric, told Fox host Sean Hannity that “the purpose of the raid, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to, you know, corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.”\n\nChristina Bobb, Trump’s attorney, said the FBI seized documents. “President Trump and his legal team have been cooperative with FBI and DOJ officials every step of the way. The FBI did conduct an unannounced raid and seized paper,” Bobb said\n\nThere was communication between the FBI and US Secret Service before the search warrant was executed Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, allowing for the FBI to access the estate without any complications. There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including some that were classified.\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump’s time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump’s attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump’s attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n“It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n“Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they’re interpreting that as a 90 day rule,” he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats “continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,” and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President’s defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had “seen enough.”\n\n“Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I’ve seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” the Republican leader wrote. “When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.”\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that “we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.”\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former President’s handling of information.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n“Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Kevin Liptak Katelyn Polantz Sara Murray Evan Perez Gaborr Dan Berman", "Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/11/05/melania-trump-barron-mar-lago-florida-new-york/76072872007/", "title": "Where's Melania Trump? Her rare appearances before Election Day ...", "text": "In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, Melania Trump appeared at many of her husband’s campaign stops. Not so in 2024.\n\nIn another rare public appearance, Melania Trump voted alongside her husband, former president Donald Trump, in his third and final try for the White House.\n\nVoting (in person) on Election Day was likely the most important campaign appearance for the couple during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhen she was first lady of the United States, Melania Trump was very much in the public eye. But since her husband sought re-election, Mrs. Donald Trump has kept a noticeably low profile.\n\nWithin the past two weeks, however, that's changed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nov 5 − Election Day 2024 − Donald and Melania Trump cast their vote at the Mandel Recreation Center, 340 Seaview Ave., Palm Beach. The couple then planned to go to Donald Trump's private club Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOn Sunday, Oct. 27, the former first lady made a rare appearance at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden — and the crowd went wild. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, one of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters, introduced Melania Trump as the “first lady of the U.S.” She then walked out and waved to the music of “Paradise City” by Guns N Roses.\n\nBut before these surprise appearances, the former model and longtime wife of reality star Donald Trump had not made an official campaign stop since last summer’s Republican National Convention (see below for a list).\n\nSince January, Melania Trump has been mourning the death of her mother, Amalija Knavs. And, presumably, she was preparing Barron Trump, her only son with Donald Trump, for college following his graduation from Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida. The 18-year-old Barron Trump picked New York University.\n\nBut as Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate, travels the country for rallies and speeches, Melania Trump has been notably absent. It's contrary to the 2016 and 2020 elections, when she made several public appearances alongside her husband.\n\nWhen there was an attempted assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, the former first lady released a statement the next day to express her thoughts and concerns: “When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change,” she wrote in a statement. “A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion — his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,” Melania Trump wrote. “The core facets of my husband's life — his human side — were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.”\n\nLess than a week after the attempted assassination attempt, Melania Trump did make a surprise appearance at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She did not deliver a speech this time as she did during the 2020 RNC in Washington, D.C., but opted to sit in the Trump family box and appear on stage later with Donald Trump when he formally accepted the Republican nomination.\n\nBarron Trump was the only immediate Trump family member who did not attend the 2024 RNC.\n\nBarron Trump also did not reportedly attend the Oct. 27 Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though it is less than three miles away from New York University. That weekend was, by the way, NYU’s Alumni and Families Weekend. It is not known whether Donald and Melania Trump attended their only son’s college event.\n\nHere's a roundup of notable 2024 campaign events that Melania Trump has attended on behalf of her husband, Donald Trump.\n\nClass of 2028?Barron Trump headed to a New York college, not UPenn or Georgetown, breaking family tradition\n\nMelania Trump attended Trumpettes Gala at Mar-a-Lago in Florida\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2024, Melania Trump and former president Donald Trump attended a Trumpettes Gala at Mar-a-Lago, the family's private club in Palm Beach, Florida. She accompanied him when he spoke to the Trumpettes fan club in February, and then for a dinner the former president hosted for Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán.\n\nOn a Primary Election Day 2024, Donald and Melania Trump cast their votes in Palm Beach, Florida\n\nOn March 19, 2024, the Florida presidential preference primary Election Day, Donald and Melania Trump cast their votes at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, Florida. \"Stay tuned,\" the former first lady said, smiling when asked about a return to presidential campaign politics.\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach Post, the appearance at the polling precinct is a rarity: Melania Trump has largely stayed out of the spotlight as her husband campaigns for the presidency for a third time, nor did she attend his \"Super Tuesday\" election victory party on the night her husband swept more than a dozen primaries to get within range of clinching a third straight GOP presidential nomination.\n\nMelania Trump attends Trump ‘awards night’ as Jack Nicklaus presents him with ‘most improved player’\n\nOn March 24, 2024, Donald and Melania Trump attended the 2024 Senior Club Championship award ceremony in West Palm Beach, Florida, where the former president added two more wins to his long self-proclaimed list, saying on his social media site he won not only the Club Championship but also the Senior Club Championship at his golf course in West Palm Beach.\n\nAccording to The Hill and Tom D'Angelo's column in Golfweek, a USA TODAY publication, Trump's declaration, which occurred during Trump International's awards night, was mocked by President Biden online: “Congratulations, Donald. Quite the accomplishment,” Biden wrote. At the awards ceremony that Melania Trump attended, Jack Nicklaus presented Donald Trump with the 2024 Trump International Golf Club Most Improved Player award.\n\nMelania Trump attends fundraiser at home of billionaire investor John Paulson\n\nOn April 6, 2024, Donald and Melania Trump arrived at the home of billionaire investor John Paulson in Palm Beach, Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that the Trump campaign expected to pocket $33 million from hedge fund guru's gathering.\n\nAccording to an invitation obtained by USA TODAY, the small group of billionaires there included Palm Beach County sugar mogul Jose “Pepe” Fanjul; Palm Beach resident and former Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross; Howard Lutnick, head of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald; mega-GOP donors Rebekah and Robert Mercer; Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts; investment banker Warren Stephens; and real estate magnate Steve Witkoff.\n\nThe price of admission on the invitation was $250,000 with a maximum contribution of $814,600, according to the April 2024 Palm Beach Post story.\n\nMelania Trump hosts fundraisers for Log Cabin Republicans, LGBTQ+ friendly conservative group\n\nDespite the group’s complicated history with her husband, on April 20, 2024, Melania Trump hosted a fundraiser for the Log Cabin Republicans at Mar-a-Lago. Less than three months later, the former first lady hosted another Log Cabin Republicans fundraiser on July 8, 2024, in New York. Donald Trump did address the conservative gay rights organization at its December 2022 gala, also held at his Palm Beach club.\n\nThe Log Cabin Republicans describe themselves as the “nation’s largest Republican organization dedicated to representing LGBTQ+ conservatives and allies.” In 2016, they declined to endorse the former president, but in the 2020 election, the Log Cabin Republicans endorsed him, reversing their previous stance, according to USA TODAY. The executive director of the group, Jerri Ann Henry, resigned shortly after.\n\nThe 2024 Republican presidential nominee has elicited criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, however, for often ridiculing transgender athletes in his rally speeches. The Palm Beach Post reported that at one event in West Palm Beach in fall 2023, Donald Trump said the former first lady did not like when he performs a particular \"routine\" — one in which he mocks a transgender weightlifter — saying she told him it was not presidential.\n\nLog Cabin Republicans and Trump:Who is the LGBTQ+ friendly conservative group?\n\nMelania Trump makes rare appearance at 2024 Republican National Convention\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the last night of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Melania Trump made a rare appearance, wearing a red suit and waving to the crowd.\n\nIn 2020, the first family — Melania Trump, Barron Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump — attended the RNC in unity to support former President Donald Trump. Most of the Trump family attended the 2024 RNC, except for one: Barron Trump.\n\nThough she did not give a speech as she did at the 2016 and 2020 RNCs, Melania Trump sat in the Trump family box for the 2024 RNC. She also surprised her husband on stage in a viral awkward moment after Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination.\n\nMelania Trump attended controversial Trump rally at Madison Square Garden ahead of Election Day 2024\n\nDonald Trump hosted a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Sunday, Oct. 27. Melania Trump made a surprise appearance there. Coincidentally, Barron Trump’s college, NYU, was hosting its Alumni and Families Weekend less than a few miles away.\n\nThe Trump rally was controversial because of Donald Trump’s off-color jabs at Democrats, and an opening comedian who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The Trump campaign distanced the candidate from the racist comment, saying it does not reflect his views.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk, one of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters, introduced Melania Trump as the “first lady of the United States.” She walked in to the music of “Paradise City” by Guns N Roses, later posting a clip of the viral moment on X, the social media platform owned by Musk and formerly known as Twitter.\n\nDonald and Melania Trump vote in person near Mar-a-Lago, Florida, on Election Day\n\nOn Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024 − Election Day − former president Donald Trump and former First Lady Melania Trump cast their ballots in the 2024 general election at the Mandel Recreation Center, which is less than five miles from Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe former first couple spoke to reporters after voting.\n\nContributing: Kate Kealey, USA TODAY Network; Kinsey Crowley and Margie Cullen, USA TODAY; Tom D'Angelo, Palm Beach Post\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

Where do Don Jr ...", "text": "Everybody seems to know Donald and Melania Trump live at Trump’s private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. What about the rest of the Trump family?\n\nLong known as a New Yorker, Donald Trump announced on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, that he would permanently leave New York for Florida on Oct. 31, 2019: \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence. ...\"\n\nWhen he was president of the United States, Donald Trump dubbed Mar-a-Lago the “Southern White House.”\n\nFrom Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago, the former president, former first lady Melania Trump and their only son, Barron Trump, moved from Trump Tower to his private estate after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Soon, Donald Trump’s adult children followed suit. Here’s a roundup of where in Florida the Trump families call home.\n\nWhere do Donald Trump, Melania Trump and their son Barron Trump live?\n\nDonald, Melania and Barron Trump have called Mar-a-Lago, which means “Sea to Lake” in Spanish, home since 2019.\n\nIn 1985, Donald Trump paid $10 million for the estate, which featured 33 bathrooms, three bomb shelters and a nine-hole golf course. Ten years later, he converted it to a private club with a spa, tennis and croquet courts, a new ballroom and beach club.\n\nMar-a-Lago is 17 acres. It sounds like a lot for an estate, but there's a lot going on there. The private club has 500 members. We don't know the exact size of the living quarters of Mar-a-Lago — but it is speculated to be somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 square feet.\n\nWill Barron Trump still live in Florida when he attends college in fall 2024?\n\nBarron Trump spent much of his childhood at Trump Tower in Manhattan — until his father was sworn in as the 45th president in early 2017. Donald and Melania Trump permanently relocated to Florida from New York in 2019.\n\nAs of Monday, July 22, it is not known which university Barron Trump will attend, though his father said college was the next step for his youngest son during a rally July 9, 2024, in Doral. Fall 2024 classes for most universities start in late August.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle purchased a $9.7 million home in Jupiter, Florida, in March 2021. The celebrity couple live in Admirals Cove, an exclusive gated community about 20 miles north of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n7 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms:Details about Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle's $9.7 million house in Florida\n\nTrump Jr. (son of Donald Trump and Ivana Trump) and former Fox News host Guilfoyle, who have been a couple since 2018, own the two-story, seven-bedroom, 12-bathroom home, which features a wine room, theater, elevator, chef's kitchen, guest wings, a pool and private dock.\n\nThe ultra-luxury Admirals Cove waterfront community has 888 homes. Features include a spa, 45 holes of golf, pickleball and tennis courts, fitness center, two clubhouses, two driving ranges and four restaurants. There's also a marina for mega-yachts and a 30-room hotel — The Inn — atop a clubhouse for guests of members.\n\nResidents who buy a home at Admirals Cove must buy a membership in the club, which costs $195,000 to join, the Palm Beach Post reported at the time.\n\nThe move enabled Trump Jr. to spend more time with his five children from his ex-wife, Vanessa, who lives nearby in the Jupiter Country Club.\n\nWhere do Eric Trump and Lara Trump live in Florida?\n\nEric Trump, son of Donald Trump and Ivana Trump, and his wife, Lara Trump, moved to Jupiter, Florida, in May 2021 from Westchester, New York. The couple bought a $3.2 million home in the gated community of Trump National Golf Club.\n\nDonald Trump's Florida operations include Trump National, Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral in Miami-Dade County.\n\nBoth Trump sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, executive vice presidents of the Trump Organization, work out of the Jupiter club offices, according to the company's website. Both men also live in Jupiter. Eric Trump lives in the Trump National residential community, and Donald Trump Jr. lives in the nearby Admirals Cove enclave.\n\n$15 million pricetag?Trump plans office complex at his Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida\n\nWhere do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner live in Florida?\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner call Billionaire Bunker home. In 2020, the couple reportedly paid $32 million for an empty waterfront lot on the island from singer Julio Iglesias, Enrique Iglesias' father, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe proper name for Billionaire Bunker, a private island near Miami Beach, Florida, is Indian Creek Village. And it's one of the most elite properties in Florida, and the world, given its residential list. The \"island\" is home to one of the world's richest people, the former First Daughter and the GOAT of football (who is not actually a billionaire), to name a few. The 300-acre island in Biscayne Bay has about 30 homes, an ultra-exclusive country club and golf course. The mansions and Indian Creek Country Club are connected to the mainland via the Surfside Bridge over Indian Creek. The area has its own law enforcement, Indian Creek Village Police Department.\n\nWhere do Tiffany Trump and husband Michael Boulos live in Florida?\n\nNews reports show Tiffany Trump, the youngest daughter of Donald Trump and second wife Marla Maples, and her husband, billionaire Michael Boulos, have lived in Miami since Tiffany Trump graduated from Georgetown University in 2020.

The couple met in 1998 at a New York fashion party, became engaged in 2004 and married in 2005.\n\nAll of this was before Trump became the 45th president of the United States, before Melania became a mom to Barron Trump (Trump’s youngest child of five), and before Mar-a-Lago, site of the billionaire’s wedding reception, became known as the Southern White House when Trump was in office.\n\nTwenty years ago, Melania Knauss was just a bride-to-be, squeezing in wedding dress fittings, finalizing celebrity invites, wedding favors and reception dinner at Mar-a-Lago.

If he wins, all his charges could be dropped or postponed for at least four years. If he loses, he could face swift sentencing in one case and trials in the other three.\n\nIf Trump were not a candidate for president, his legal trouble would be unavoidable. He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money case. Two trials loom − one in federal court in Washington, D.C., and one in Georgia state court − on charges he tried to steal the 2020 election. In Florida, a Trump-appointed federal judge dismissed charges that Trump mishandled classified documents after leaving the White House. But that reprieve could be temporary; prosecutors have appealed the decision.\n\nBeing elected president would give Trump an out because legal experts say serious action in the New York and Georgia cases would likely be postponed until after he serves his four-year term. Trump has said he would fire Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in the two federal cases; he also could try to pardon himself.\n\nBut if Trump loses, all of his cases can move forward − assuming he doesn't succeed in his various legal gambits to delay and derail them, including his argument that he is protected by the Supreme Court's ruling in July creating expansive presidential immunity from criminal charges.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in October found a majority of 58% of likely voters think it would be “wrong” for Trump to direct the Justice Department to dismiss the federal charges against him. A similar majority of 56% of respondents said prosecutors should continue to pursue the criminal cases if he loses the election.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere’s where the cases stand:\n\nSentencing in New York hush money case looms Nov. 26\n\nTrump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels to silence her about an alleged sexual encounter before the 2016 election.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan will decide Nov. 12 whether Trump is immune from the charges under the Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling. Trump has argued some evidence in the case should be thrown out, along with the conviction, because of the high court’s decision.\n\nIf Trump isn’t shielded from the conviction, Merchan set sentencing for Nov. 26.\n\nBut a Trump victory could mean Merchan would postpone the sentencing or the punishment until after his administration is over. And even if sentencing went forward, a sentence that would significantly interfere with Trump's presidential responsibilities, such as a prison term, probably couldn't be implemented, according to legal experts.\n\nA 2000 Justice Department memo that lays out federal policy argues it would be unconstitutional to imprison a sitting president because it would \"preclude the executive branch from performing its constitutionally assigned functions.\"\n\n\"There's a sense out there that they would follow the norm of the feds and therefore delay the sentencing in the New York case until after he finished his presidency,\" Robert Weisberg, a Stanford law professor who teaches criminal law and procedure, told USA TODAY.\n\nAn election loss would leave Merchan to sentence the real estate mogul to anything from nothing at all to several years in prison.\n\nTrump could direct Justice Department to abandon federal cases\n\nTrump has said he would fire the federal prosecutor, Smith, and possibly even jail him.\n\n“It’s so easy − I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24.\n\nTrump opponents would view that as an attack on the Justice Department's historic independence. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, introduced a bill to prevent a president from dismissing a criminal prosecution against himself, but it is unlikely to pass the Republican-majority House of Representatives.\n\n\"The rule of law is a core foundation of our nation, Schiff said in a statement. \"No one, not even the president, is above it.\"\n\nTrump has said Smith treated him unfairly.\n\n“They ought to throw Deranged Jack Smith and his Thug Prosecutors in jail, with Meritless Garland and Trump Hating Lisa Monaco,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social in July 2023, referring to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “They have totally Weaponized the Department of Injustice.”\n\nGarland has repeatedly denied that the prosecutions were politically motivated. “Justice Department prosecutors are nonpartisan,\" he said. \"They don't allow partisan considerations to play any role in their determinations.”\n\nTrump contends he could pardon himself\n\nArticle 2 of the Constitution states the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” The power applies to federal cases.\n\nTrump has said he could pardon himself, but that remains a subject for legal debate.\n\n“As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself,” Trump said in a 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhere do federal charges stand alleging Trump tried to steal 2020 election?\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is weighing whether to dismiss any of the charges against Trump accusing him of conspiring to steal the 2020 election.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that former presidents are shielded from prosecution for official acts but vulnerable to charges for private acts while in office.\n\nTrump and his lawyers contend the entire case should be thrown out based on presidential immunity. But Smith has argued that Trump was acting for his private gain rather than the public duty of serving in office when he tried to reverse his defeat in 2020.\n\nClassified documents case already dismissed, but appeal could be abandoned\n\nBesides firing Smith, Trump could direct the Justice Department to abandon the appeal of the dismissal of his other federal case, which charged him with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the charges by ruling that Smith’s appointment was illegitimate because the post was powerful enough that it should have required congressional authorization or Senate confirmation, as with U.S. attorneys.\n\nSmith has asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn her decision. He cited federal laws authorizing the attorney general to appoint officials and numerous court decisions upholding special counsel appointments for decades.\n\nThe charges accuse Trump of unlawful retention of more than 100 national security documents for a year and a half after leaving the White House. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, has argued repeatedly that he could take records with him after leaving the White House and that he declassified them despite the lack of documentation for his assertion.\n\nGeorgia charges loom even if federal charges are dismissed\n\nTrump’s Georgia trial on election racketeering charges could be postponed under the Constitution's supremacy clause if he wins back the White House.\n\nIf Trump loses the election, the Georgia Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments Dec. 5 about whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case.\n\nTrump has argued Willis should be removed and the charges dropped because her romantic relationship with another prosecutor, Nathan Wade, spurred her to pursue the case.\n\nThe charges accuse Trump of conspiracy for urging state lawmakers to replace the state’s presidential electors with Republicans despite Democrat Joe Biden winning the state. Trump also is charged with soliciting a public official to violate his oath of office for asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” him enough votes to win.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/florida/2017/07/31/florida-woman-blames-selfies-trump-her-divorce-palm-beach-countys-top-prosecutor/526572001/", "title": "Florida woman blames selfies with Trump for her divorce from Palm ...", "text": "Avi Selk\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nThe news release begins with a statement as terse and vague as you would expect from a high-profile couple confirming their divorce, after reporters got wind of it.\n\nLynn and Dave Aronberg — a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader and the top prosecutor in Palm Beach County, Florida, respectively — have \"decided to respectfully and amicably part ways and end our marriage,\" they announced in a joint statement last week.\n\n\"We kindly ask for your support in preserving our privacy as we start to navigate this new chapter of our lives.\"\n\nSo far, so standard.\n\nAnd then, mystifyingly, the next seven paragraphs of the news release are spent obliterating privacy and expectations alike.\n\nThe release, which was issued by Lynn Aronberg's PR representative, quotes almost verbatim from a gossip website about the \"brand new BMW\" and tens of thousands of dollars that she apparently extracted from her husband in a settlement.\n\nIt claims the state attorney's reluctance to have children contributed to the breakup.\n\nAnd it concludes with the line that would propel the couple's divorce case from Palm Beach County gossip pages to international news:\n\n\"A staunch Republican and supporter of President Donald Trump, Lynn also said she felt increasingly isolated in the marriage.\"\n\nOr as the PR firm headlined it: \"the Trump Divorce.\"\n\nWith the same anonymous sources and exclamation points it would use to chronicle the demise of their marriage, the website Gossip Extra broke news of the couple's engagement minutes after it took place in late 2014:\n\n\"EXCLUSIVE,\" reads the headline, \"State Attorney Dave Aronberg Asks ex-Miami Dolphins Cheerleader to Marry Him ... Atop Eiffel Tower ... She Says Yes!\"\n\nThey had met years earlier, Lynn Aronberg told The Washington Post, when he was a state senator in the 2000s. She described herself as a lifelong Republican and him as \"a short Democrat\" who nevertheless appealed to her.\n\nThey married on a beach in 2015. The gossip site covered that, too.\n\nThough she put aside cheerleading years ago to build a career in publicity, Aronberg, 37, said her husband's liberal supporters came to regard her as \"the hayseed wife\" — nearly 10 years his junior, with intolerable politics.\n\n\"It wasn't an issue at first, but that was before the Hillary-Trump saga,\" she said. \"And as that built, the tension in our relationship built.\"\n\nDespite his affiliation in the Florida statehouse, Aronberg is not exactly a party-line Democrat.\n\nHe was elected to the state attorney's office in 2012 with the help of Republican donors, according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nAnd the prosecutor has been spotted multiple times at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, according to the newspaper — despite backing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race; investigating assault accusations against Trump's campaign manager that year; and recent reports that he may be considering a bid for U.S. Congress under the Democratic banner.\n\nWhile Lynn Aronberg has been a Trump fan since his days on \"The Apprentice\" — she owns a three-legged dog named Ivanka — she said her husband had known the mogul for years.\n\nHe raised political funds at Mar-a-Lago, she said, and took her to the resort nearly every weekend — even as Trump's brand became increasingly toxic to her husband's liberal base.\n\n\"I'm walking through the red carpet, and he's sneaking through the bushes,\" she said, recalling selfies she snapped with the future president and his wife, Melania Trump, while her husband would \"run and hide from the photographers.\"\n\n\"He'd ask me to not to take pictures. He wouldn't want me to post them,\" she said.\n\n\"I did not listen to him.\"\n\nHer Facebook wall and photo galleries attest to that. Grinning with Melania Trump in multiple photos. Posing with the future president in a gold-trimmed ballroom on New Year's Eve, three weeks before he moved into the White House.\n\n\"He's really nice,\" Lynn Aronberg said of Donald Trump. \"He's like: 'Dave: How did you get her to marry you?'\"\n\nBut staying married to him became a strain as the presidential race wore on, she told The Post. At the couple's home in West Palm Beach, she said, her selfie habit drew irritated phone calls from her husband's supporters.\n\n\"You know, the unions,\" she said. \"Or sometimes he wouldn't even tell me who was calling him, to say not to post pictures of Trump or Melania.\"\n\nShe would refuse the requests, she said.\n\nEventually she'd do so in public.\n\n\"So what if I like Ivanka Trump or a conservative issue on social media?\" Lynn Aronberg told Gossip Extra in February, the same month she filed for divorce. \"So what if I invite Melania to be in my book group?\"\n\n\"Dave Aronberg's Divorce Getting Downright Ugly!\" the website reported in June, quoting an unnamed friend of the family.\n\nAnd then last week, \"a source familiar with the negotiations\" gave Gossip Extra details of a settlement that Aronberg reportedly signed with her husband: \"$100,000 worth of goodies in exchange for her signature on the dotted line.\"\n\nAnd the website expanded on their private woes:\n\n\"They have no children, which was a problem for Lynn,\" it reported. And then all the stuff about Trump.\n\nThese articles were no more popular with her husband's supporters than her selfies, Lynn Aronberg told The Post: \"They'd get mad and try to say I'm leaking it.\"\n\nShe denied doing so. She also declined to discuss her divorce settlement with The Post — and said she didn't know how the same details that Gossip Extra reported ended up in a news release on Thursday, released by her PR representative, beneath the couple's brief statement confirming \"the end of our marriage.\"\n\nNot that Lynn Aronberg minded the leaks, exactly.\n\n\"I trust them,\" she said of the PR firm, TransMedia. \"I don't care if they're repeating something Gossip Extra already said.\"\n\nLynn Aronberg runs a separate PR company under her own name but said she used to work for TransMedia, which currently lists her as an executive vice president, though she denied being an employee.\n\n\"She's what we call a partner in our firm,\" said Thomas Madden, TransMedia's chief executive.\n\nHe said the company had gathered the Aronberg's settlement details — along information about Trump's role in the divorce — from \"other sources.\"\n\n\"There's nothing inaccurate,\" he said. \"She did not violate any privacy agreements.\"\n\nDave Aronberg, who has been approached about running for U.S. Congress, couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nA spokesman for the prosecutor, Christian Ulvert, confirmed that Aronberg had reached a settlement in his divorce but declined to discuss it or the private details that appeared in his wife's news release.\n\n\"My client's ready to just close this chapter,\" Ulvert said.\n\nAs for Lynn Aronberg, she told The Post that she remains friends with her soon-to-be-ex husband — though he's not thrilled about the leaks, wherever they're coming from.\n\nShe has dinner plans with Donald Trump Jr. coming up, she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/01/18/how-tall-barron-trump-compare-to-donald-trump-joe-biden-tom-brady-ron-desantis-brad-pitt-guy-fieri/72269041007/", "title": "Barron Trump height: Former President Trump's son 6 feet 7 inches tall", "text": "The Florida funeral for Amalija Knavs, mother to Melania Trump and grandmother to Barron Trump, began Thursday morning with the former first lady, her father Viktor Knavs, Barron, former President Donald Trump in attendance.\n\nPalm Beach County residents were warned to avoid the area around the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, located a few miles north of Trump's Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nDonald, Melania and Barron Trump were joined at the church by friends and family, including Donald Trump’s daughters Ivanka and Tiffany, and their spouses, Jared Kushner and Michael Boulos.

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation fou", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/health/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-health-hnk-spc-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Millions have the same 'bendy body' disease as my daughter. Why ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2023/09/29/banned-books-read-these-books-now-and-why-in-defense-of-books/71008499007/", "title": "Banned books: Why you should read these 51 books right now", "text": "USA TODAY staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs journalists, it's our job to seek out the truth even when it's uncomfortable. We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\nBanned books explained:Book bans are on the rise.

Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/us/new-york-subway-crime-adams-miller/index.html", "title": "New York subway crime: What is perception, what is real, and how ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe New York subway system is one of the world’s largest, oldest and most complicated with 472 stations and 665 miles of track. But crime and fear has become a real issue for the system.\n\nRiders who were driven away by the pandemic are returning to the system, but perhaps more slowly because of headlines about stabbings, robberies and people being shoved in front of trains by strangers.\n\nUnderstanding transit crime is different from street crime. It’s not a single neighborhood you can flood with cops, or a particular ring of criminals who can be targeted and rounded up. New York’s transit system defies regular community policing tactics because it is not a community but is the sprawling and constantly moving system which binds all of New York’s communities together.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams recently pushed back on fears the subways have become more dangerous by saying the problem is more one of “perception” than a statistical increase in crime.\n\nIs crime up this year in the transit system significantly?\n\nYes, it is, if you compare the numbers to last year, crime in the transit system is up by more than 40%. The thing driving the numbers is larceny, which usually means someone’s phone or wallet was stolen from their bag or off a seat, sometimes it’s when people doze off. So nonviolent crime is up more than violent crime, but it is the violent crimes we are seeing in the news stories which are a shock to the senses of many riders.\n\nSo what about violent crime?\n\nWhat police are seeing are small numbers, but they have significant impact on the system and the psyche of its riders. There have been three murders so far this month; too many in too short a time to not ask a serious question about safety. Those three murders make it nine so far for 2022. During the same period last year, the number of murders was six. Robberies are also up by about 34%, Felony Assault is up by about 17%. If you compare those to last year when there were still a million fewer riders.\n\nIt sounds like crime is out of control then, doesn’t it?\n\nSo, this is where it gets complicated, but it’s actually worth understanding. It does seem like crime is up dramatically unless you zoom out. If you take the “seven majors” which are the standard for measuring crime, murder, rape, robbery, felonious assault, burglary, grand larceny what you see is all these crimes were slightly higher in 2019 before the pandemic. Right now, crime is actually lower than it was in 2018 or 2019 by 4%.\n\nWhat other factors do you have to consider to figure this out?\n\nRidership. Think of the transit system as its own city. In 2019, the New York subways would have had a population of about 5.5 million people (riders). If a “place” with a population greater than Los Angeles only had six serious crimes a day, it would be fantastic. Having 10 or 12 murders for the year would make it by far the safest big city in the nation. But let’s get back to transit. We have less crime than we had pre-pandemic, but we also have lower ridership. But even with ridership rising to an average of 3.8 million in recent weeks, the chances of being a crime victim remain very low, about one in 600,000.\n\nSo why are so many riders frightened?\n\nA couple of reasons. First, if they read the tabloids they would have to be. These are examples of the headlines for October: “Spike in Transit Crime,” “Governor’s Race Spotlight Finds Transit Safety Issue,” “Terrified New Yorkers Turn to Vespas and Citi Bikes,” “As Subway Horrors Continue, Adams Must Push Hochul to Act” and then, of course, there are the stories of the crime of the day. But understanding riders’ fear goes beyond the violent crime that gets more attention because it’s happening on the subways. Those stories are in people’s consciousness sure, but then they go into the subway and in the course of a day or a week, they see the homeless guy sprawled out on the bench, they see the mentally ill person screaming or acting out, the kids smoking weed, they see the man urinating on the corner of the platform of worse, in the train. All of this, though not violent crime, gives riders a sense of disorder and fear. They just feel like things don’t seem to be quite under control down there and even if they’ve never been a victim of a serious crime in the system, seeing all that, it makes them edgy.\n\nSo, where is the enforcement?\n\nInteresting question. The NYPD makes literally thousands of arrests in the transit system each year and issues thousands more summonses. This year, so far, police have made 6,793 arrests in the transit system. Last year at this time it was 4,622. Arrests are up 47%, but that’s for crimes. When you look at the other violations – the “quality of life” conditions – the ones that make people feel unsafe in the system, those summonses are up over 200%. It would be hard to argue in a general sense police are not engaged in enforcement.\n\nIf arrests and summonses have increased by that much over the last two years, why has crime increased in the same two years?\n\nEven before bail reform and criminal justice reform laws changed how cops could enforce laws in the subways, district attorneys stopped prosecuting many of these violations and crimes. Perhaps the most significant among those crimes was turnstile jumping. Transit cops have an old saying: “He who controls the gate, controls the system.” What they mean is most of the people behind serious disorder in the system don’t pay to get in. Ticketing, and in some cases, arresting people for jumping the turnstile used to be a key controller of reducing overall crime in the system. It used to be by the third time a person was caught jumping the turnstile, instead of just another ticket, they could be arrested. The district attorneys are not writing those charges up. Smoking weed on the trains or platforms (or even cigarettes) is still a violation. The public urination and the other things are all just a ticket now and the violators often just toss them. Even for misdemeanor criminal offenses there’s a reluctance by prosecutors to charge them and by judges to do anything other than to dismiss them. Many criminals and violators have come pretty confident there will be little or no consequence beyond a moment’s inconvenience.\n\nSo if the cops are spinning their wheels, why do they bother?\n\nFrankly, they ask themselves that a lot but their chief, Jason Wilcox, and their supervisors are pushing them to engage. They are encouraging the officers to write the summons, even if the result is uncertain. Only by engaging after a violation can an officer get their ID and find out if the person you are talking to has a warrant for a serious violent crime on the system or the street. Sometimes, just the act of engaging someone who is committing a violation leads to them stopping it. An arrest is where an officer may find they are carrying a knife or a gun. Sometimes it just tells the person the cops will engage where they see a violation. The riding public and the violator both need to see on a daily basis the cops are still in the game down there, even if the laws are weaker and the district attorneys decline to charge. Otherwise, the perception is, the police are just giving up.", "authors": ["John Miller"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/04/doomsday-preppers-and-election-2024-fears/71695426007/", "title": "Could 2024 election cause society to collapse? Some preppers ...", "text": "Brekke Wagoner looks out the windows of her home in North Carolina and sees disaster coming.\n\nNot immediately, but someday, as hurricanes and other storms supercharged by climate change barrel up the Eastern Seaboard, drenching neighborhoods, knocking out power and destroying roads.\n\nBut it's not the storms she worries about, not exactly.\n\nInstead, she worries that an incompetent federal government run by someone like current Republican front-runner and former President Donald Trump will botch the humanitarian response to a predictable disaster. She's one of a growing number of people on both sides of the political divide who are preparing for the possibility of a disastrous collapse of society after the 2024 election.\n\nWagoner, 39, represents a relatively small but growing segment of Americans who consider themselves \"preppers\" ‒ people prepared to survive without government assistance during disasters. Those disasters could encompass anything from a major storm to widespread looting sparked by election anger.\n\nMore Americans preparing for disaster ahead of election\n\nIn the past 12 months, 39% of millennials and 40% of Gen Zers reported having spent money on prepping, according to Finder.com, which has collected similar data since at least 2017. Overall, almost 30% of Americans surveyed reported taking some steps toward emergency preparedness last year, up from about 25% in 2017, according to the annual Finder survey.\n\n\"On the left, you have people afraid (Trump) is going to declare himself dictator of the United States and people on the left are going to end up as targets in some sort of authoritarian system,\" said prepping expert and author Brad Garrett. \"On the right, it's general malaise and a fear of society unraveling. They point to these smash-and-grab robberies, riots and protests.\"\n\nOne expert consulted by USA TODAY said a failure or perceived failure of government is almost always the trigger for people to begin prepping. He said the number of younger, more liberal people prepping indicates a loss of trust in government.\n\n\"That's the impetus for all the preppers I've ever dealt with: They saw something and felt the government could not or would not help,” said Chad Huddleston of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, a professor and anthropologist who has studied the prepping community extensively.\n\nHuddleston said it’s important to distinguish between the large numbers of people who consider being prepared for emergencies their civic and family responsibility and those who are, sometimes eagerly, awaiting societal collapse. But he said the number of people deliberately preparing for a crisis tied to a Trump-Biden election is growing.\n\n“On one side, people think Trump may bring a New World Order and ‘they’ will come and get us, so we need to be ready,\" he said. \"And then on the other hand you have the communities who think things will get just get worse so we have to help ourselves.\"\n\nCount Wagoner among those people. She sees climate change as a worsening existential threat the government isn't prepared for, especially if a Republican is in charge.\n\n\"The intensification of our natural storm seasons is the No. 1 thing that's going to happen to you,\" she said. \"An electromagnetic pulse that takes out the electrical grid could happen. A nuclear war might happen. A civil war might happen. But a storm will happen.\"\n\nPrepping is becoming increasingly diverse\n\nThough the movement has long been associated with libertarian-fueled apocalyptic scenarios like a zombie infestation or the collapse of modern society, as highlighted by the 2020 television show \"Doomsday Preppers,\" Wagoner is among younger, more liberal people who say the Trump administration flubbed its responses during the 2017 hurricane season, particularly in Puerto Rico, and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOverall, prepping appears to reflect the deep uncertainty many Americans feel: A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll found that 67% of Americans think the country is facing either bigger problems than usual or is in the most troubled state they've ever seen. The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 17-20 by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nExperts say younger preppers like Wagoner reflect broad concerns for the nation's future as we choose our next president. Some are stockpiling weapons and medical supplies in armored bunkers. Others are urging their neighbors to set aside enough food to survive for weeks or months without outside help.\n\n\"If you can be prepared, you won't be a drain on the resources needed to help the people who didn’t prepare,” said Wagoner, who has a 90-day supply of food set aside for her six-person family. Wagoner, who works for a nonprofit, runs a YouTube channel where she offers prepping advice to young people, urban residents and people who have small homes.\n\n\"In the face of an apocalypse, I want to come out and calmly help people,” she said. “I want to be able to create a society that instead of wanting to shoot every stranger, understands our interdependence and creates a better society.”\n\nMany disaster response experts say the ideas espoused by Wagoner is the most reasonable and responsible approach for Americans to take, building off the assumption that neighbors, churches and nonprofits like the Red Cross or Salvation Army will always play a front-line role in helping recover from a disaster, filling in the gaps until the federal government gets organized.\n\nGuns and bunkers: Some preppers are focused on their own survival\n\nIf Wagoner represents one end of the spectrum ‒ focused on community, interdependence and cooperation ‒ retired U.S. Air Force Col. Drew Miller represents the other. He's prepared for a full societal collapse caused by war, a nuclear explosion or rampaging mobs angry at election results.\n\nMiller's \"Fortitude Ranch\" has built seven compounds around the country, including Nevada, Wisconsin and outside Washington, D.C., where members can retreat for up to a year, armed and isolated from whatever may come. In addition to stockpiles of food, propane and whiskey, the compounds are outfitted with solar panels, wells and two-way radios. And lots and lots of guns.\n\nTheir plan during a collapse: Members will immediately flee to the closest compound, poach wildlife for meat, surround their compound with log walls and shoot any \"marauders\" who approach too close. USA TODAY toured one of the compounds in southern Colorado, where Spartan accommodations await members who pay a minimum of $1,200 a year for what Miller calls a different kind of life insurance.\n\n“We’ll have decent chow here come a collapse,” he said. “We guarantee a year of food, but not of toilet paper.”\n\nFortitude Ranch in Colorado has about 100 members, Miller said. He acknowledges the cost of joining would be a financial burden for many Americans, but he pulled out a $300 pistol to argue that being prepared doesn't have to cost a fortune. He said the ultra-rich have their own compounds but will depend on paid staff to protect them, while he believes individual families in cities will become targets for armed gangs, especially if people get hungry and desperate.\n\nHis advice for city dwellers stockpiling supplies in their homes: \"The first rule of prepping is to not tell people you're a prepper.\"\n\nInside Fortitude Ranch's Colorado compound, which includes an armored guard post, sniper positions and underground bunkers, members aim to remain isolated for as long as needed. Members have added their own beds, furniture and ammunition stockpiles to the group supplies cached around the property.\n\nAmong the weapons: a .50-caliber rifle to disable oncoming vehicles, hunting rifles to kill deer, and plenty of pistols. Members also have cupboards filled with first-aid kits and have recruited doctors and people with military medical training to help keep their fellow preppers healthy.\n\nThe group's plan is to ride out any collapse and then be positioned to take advantage of business opportunities opened up by widespread urban deaths. That's what happened when the Black Death killed tens of millions of Europeans and Asians in the 1300s: It concentrated wealth and resources among survivors.\n\nMiller said the compounds are primarily set up to be defensive, and while they'd be open to bartering with their neighbors during a collapse, they wouldn't help non-members who came begging for food or assistance. Otherwise, he said, no one would pay to join Fortitude Ranch until times got tough.\n\nMiller worries about a wide variety of problems, from a pandemic that kills a large majority of Americans to a nuclear detonation that wipes out the nation's electrical grid and our modern electronic devices. He said many of his clients started thinking seriously about survival during the protests and riots that came after George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020. The overwhelming majority of protests were peaceful, although some caused significant property damage in multiple cities and drew threats from Trump that he would send the military to stop them.\n\n\"There could easily be a civil war during a Biden-Trump election,\" he said, referencing the violent 2020 clashes in Portland between armed federal agents dispatched by Trump against Black Lives Matter protesters, some of whom shot fireworks at officers.\n\nMiller's group deliberately avoids getting into the political debate, although he acknowledges many members have military training. And scattered around the compound are multiple copies of his 2011 novel \"Rohan Nation,\" a libertarian-focused tale of survivalists written as a call to break \"nation's addiction to socialist entitlements and return to Constitutional, strictly limited government, focused on security.\"\n\nMiller said your politics don't matter in a cataclysm ‒ only your willingness to work with the small number of survivors in the compound to get through the first worst months of a crisis so you can launch a business to take advantage of vacant real estate and free-market needs.\n\n“I want middle-class Americans to survive, and we make it affordable to do that,\" Miller said. “I think eventually things will recover ‒ and I want to be alive for that.”\n\n'Unfortunate arms race' for conservative, liberal preppers ahead of election\n\nGarrett, the author and academic, spent three years visiting eight counties and interviewing hundreds of preppers for his 2020 book \"Bunker,\" which explores the philosophies driving the prepper movement. He said Miller's Fortitude Ranch reflects a typical libertarian-focused prepper mindset in which the government is inherently incompetent and that everyone is more or less on their own.\n\nBut he said some liberals, especially younger ones, were shocked into action by the pandemic and the federal government's response to the George Floyd protests ‒ they had never personally experienced such government failure or hostility before and suddenly feel vulnerable. He said the upcoming presidential election is only sharpening those concerns on both sides of the nation's divide.\n\n\"We do have this authoritarian streak running through the right, and prepping plays into that. They are prepared for violence, no question,\" he said. \"But you're also seeing an increase in militancy on the left. I'm seeing a lot of liberal preppers buying guns, saying that they waited too long. It's an unfortunate arms race that I do think we're going to see escalating as we head into the election, particularly if it's Trump versus Biden.\"\n\nGarrett said many of the younger preppers, while worried about a fascist federal government under a second Trump administration, are also concerned about the growing impact of climate change. He said there's a shift back toward being prepared for disasters in a way people routinely were 100 years ago, especially in rural areas.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of people who are not worried about the apocalypse but if the power goes out for three days,\" he said. \"You're seeing more prepping but less extreme prepping.\"\n\nPrepping can help others\n\nBack in North Carolina, Wagoner would consider herself among those who take responsible, reasonable steps to prepare. She and her husband got rid of some of their books and camping gear to make room for their food stockpile. And they eschew having guns, even though they'd be prepared to use them in self-defense, she said. For Wagoner, being prepared comes with an explicit addendum: so she can help others.\n\nOn her YouTube channel, Wagoner said she tries to help people understand that being prepared doesn't need to be expensive, and that gradually building up a stockpile of nonperishable foods like pasta and rice is an easy way to be self-sufficient in a crisis.\n\nShe explicitly rejects the philosophy of what Garrett calls \"dread merchants\" ‒ people capitalizing on fear to sell packs of freeze-dried meals, \"bugout bags,\" battery banks or guns ‒ and encourages her audience to think about how prepping will help their community.\n\n\"When I talk about preparedness, I start with 'What's most likely'?\" she said. \"You have to ask, what are you prepping for? Are you prepping to survive for a Max Mad world? Because if that's what prepare for, that's what you'll ultimately create. And I'm prepping for community survival. My perspective is that we are better together.\"\n\nShe added: \"Jesus would slap the s--- out of anyone who had food and refused to help their neighbors who were hungry.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/vote-in-wisconsin-election-results-and-updates-polling-places-voting-sites/6130134002/", "title": "Voting in Wisconsin: Updates from polling places and election results", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin staff members are out in force this week to keep you informed on this historic election.\n\nFollow our regular updates, from scene-setting at the polls on Tuesday to results and reaction as races are called.\n\nResults:Statewide results, county breakdowns and more\n\nMore:Why Wisconsin election results weren't final on Tuesday\n\nFull coverage:Wisconsin election section\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n10:05 a.m.: Reaction starting to pour in after Wisconsin votes blue\n\nSeveral celebrities posted on social media Wednesday, commenting on Wisconsin's vote totals revealing a win for Joe Biden in the presidential election.\n\nThat included Kenosha native Mark Ruffalo, whose presence in the preceding months including collaborating on a pro-voting commercial in the state and speaking to community members following unrest in his hometown.\n\nOn the CBS \"Late Show,\" host Stephen Colbert pointed out that the state is now full of \"Blue Cheeseheads.\"\n\n\"So they smell weird, but they taste great crumbled on a salad made with poached pear and candied walnuts.\"\n\nDaniel Bice of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel pointed out winners and losers of the election, including a winner in Assembly Speaker Robin Vos.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n4:11 p.m.: Despite Rudy Guliani's false claim, ballots did not just materialize\n\nSpeaking at a press conference that aired on Fox News, Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Guliani, falsely said that about 120,000 ballots just mysteriously showed up in Wisconsin about 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. — part of “a concerted effort of the crooks that run the Democrat Party.”\n\nTrump's team has announced it will pursue legal action to stop vote-tallying in Pennsylvania because of lack of transparency and has already expressed desire for a recount in Wisconsin, a state declared for Joe Biden earlier Wednesday.\n\nClaims similar to Guliani's have made the rounds citing irregularities in the Wisconsin election, unfounded claims that are debunked by Politifact.\n\n3:53 p.m.: Voter confusion in Glendale solved with an assist from ... Georgia's Stacy Abrams\n\nGlendale resident Larry Sandler submitted his absentee ballot last week at Glendale City Hall but later discovered his ballot wasn’t marked as received online, he said in a Facebook post.\n\nSandler, a former reporter with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said he was informed of his voting status after receiving a robocall from Stacy Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate. The call included the comment that according to records, Sandler hadn't yet voted.\n\n“I called Glendale City Hall, and fortunately they were able to find my ballot and promise me it would be counted,” he said.\n\nGlendale City Clerk Megan Humitz was out of office on Election Day after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. City Administrator Rachel Safstrom said she was unable to speak on Sandler’s situation, but it is possible that the check-in step on WisVote could be missed.\n\n“This step missed does not mean the ballot would not be processed at the polls,” Safstrom said in an email. “It just means they could not see it was processed online.”\n\nSafstrom said if a person drops off an absentee ballot at the polls on Election Day, it wouldn’t go to the clerk, but would be processed at the polls, and part of the final reconciliation logged in by the clerk’s office.\n\n“If any resident contacted us with concern we would locate the ballot,” Safstrom said. “Residents can always review their voting record on MyVote. Final reconciliation for this election will be completed in the upcoming weeks.”\n\nSafstrom said there were several residents who cited ballot issues, only to find out they believed the website’s status meant that the resident received the ballot, but not the municipality.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n3:40: Rock band R.E.M. salutes Wisconsin with songs from classic Madison show\n\nShortly after The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election Wednesday, R.E.M offered a \"nod\" to the state — and shared old songs recorded in Madison.\n\nThe left-leaning band — which officially broke up in 2011, but still maintains social media channels — shared a YouTube link on Twitter to recordings of a couple of songs from a 1982 set at Madison club Merlyn's, of \"Catapult\" and \"Radio Free Radio.\"\n\n\"A nod to Wisconsin from the mists of time … ,\" read the accompanying tweet.\n\nWisconsin being called for Biden brought the Democratic challenger closer to achieving the needed 270 electoral college votes to clinch the presidency. Biden received about 20,000 more votes in Wisconsin than President Donald Trump, but the Trump campaign said it would call for a recount.\n\n— Piet Levy\n\n3:35 p.m.: Despite ballot glitch, Outagamie County avoids delays\n\nThousands of misprinted ballots led to many additional hours of work for poll workers in Outagamie County on Election Day but didn't lead to any significant delays in counting votes.\n\nThe municipalities with the most misprinted ballots had enough poll workers to handle the workload, Outagamie County Clerk Lori O'Bright told The Post-Crescent on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"I am very pleased with how hard everyone worked,\" O'Bright said. \"It was amazing, so I appreciate all the hard work of our municipalities and their poll workers.\"\n\nThe last results in Outagamie County were reported about 2 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe misprint was visible in a black square — known as a timing mark — near the edge of the ballots. It was small, but still large enough that machines used to scan ballots weren't able to accurately read them.\n\nTo make sure those votes were still counted, poll workers had to duplicate the ballots by transferring votes to a new ballot that could be read by machine. The process required two workers and typically takes about four minutes per ballot.\n\n— Chris Mueller\n\n2:12 p.m.: Two intriguing District Attorney races\n\nTo no real surprise, the Waushara County District Attorney who abandoned her job just two months after appointment by Gov. Tony Evers, lost her bid to keep the job via election.\n\nAnd In Iron County, incumbent DA Matthew Tingstad defeated a challenger who got in the race this summer after questions arose about whether Tingstad ever moved to Wisconsin from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan after his election in 2016.\n\nHis opponent, Doug Muskett, was another Upper Michigan lawyer, who said he made a point of moving across the Montreal River to Hurley even before the election, though he could legally run as a Michigan resident, just like Tingstad had.\n\nMuskett got well more than the needed 200 write-in votes during an August primary to get on Tuesday's ballot as a Democrat.\n\nBut in the election, Tingstad, running as a Republican in a county went heavily for President Donald Trump, beat Muskett by less than 1,000 votes, 2,398 to 1,506.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n2:01 p.m.: Milwaukee leaders praise Election Commission effort\n\nMilwaukee leaders on Wednesday applauded the work of the city’s Election Commission to prepare and execute Tuesday’s election, which required processing almost 170,000 absentee ballots and took place as the state’s coronavirus cases have been rising at an alarming pace.\n\nIn April, as the pandemic was ramping up, the city made national headlines for the challenges its voters faced in casting their ballots. At that point, the city was hemorrhaging poll workers and opened only five polling locations on Election Day.\n\nThat wasn’t the case Tuesday, when the city opened 173 neighborhood-based polling sites. It also had 15 absentee ballot drop boxes and more than a dozen early in-person voting locations.\n\nResults from the city’s nearly 170,000 absentee ballots were taken from Central Count in downtown to the Milwaukee County Courthouse about 3 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n“I want to say a huge thank you to Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg, her staff, all election workers and volunteers,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett tweeted late Wednesday morning. “I’m grateful to everyone who worked around the clock yesterday and into the morning to get our ballots processed as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said Woodall-Vogg and her staff worked hard in the months leading up to Tuesday to organize a safe election in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nMilwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson said in a statement that the city “put forth an historic infrastructure this election to ensure that all residents could vote safely and securely during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nJohnson, who worked a shift at Central Count, credited Woodall-Vogg with putting together an efficient, smooth operation to accurately count absentee ballots.\n\n“I applaud Ms. Woodall-Vogg, Election Commission staff, and all of the poll workers and volunteers who worked into the night to sustain our democratic process of free and fair elections,” he said. “As a city we are very proud and grateful for your service.”\n\nUnder Wisconsin law, the city could only begin counting absentee ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Central Count workers worked in shifts to process all of the absentee ballots.\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley on Wednesday afternoon also thanked those who worked and volunteered in Tuesday’s election – and the months leading up to it.\n\nAnd he thanked county residents for voting.\n\n“More people participating in the process and exercising their right to vote is a testament to the level of engagement across Milwaukee County and across the political spectrum, and to all those who helped make sure the COVID-19 pandemic did not get in the way of democracy,” he said in a statement. “These are the true heroes of the election process and we are forever grateful for their tireless work.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n1:33 p.m.: Associated Press officially calls Wisconsin for Biden\n\nThe Associated Press declared Democrat Joe Biden the winner in Wisconsin on Wednesday, after the state once again went down to the wire in the presidential election.\n\nUnofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes, and the Trump campaign in a statement already vowed it would request a recount.\n\nBiden's lead is very close to Trump's winning margin in 2016 over Hillary Clinton.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in the early morning hours when the City of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead.\n\n— Read full story from Craig Gilbert and Patrick Marley\n\n1:24 p.m.: Results from lone outstanding Wisconsin precinct slowed by missing clerk\n\nJust one Wisconsin precinct hasn’t reported voting totals, and county election officials in the area say they don’t know when they’ll know the results.\n\nRichland County Clerk Victor Vlasak said the Willow township clerk went home sick from the polls on Tuesday, and he hasn’t been able to reach her or anyone in the township.\n\nVlasak said the clerk typically would provide voting totals by phone on Election Day. That didn’t happen and he said he can't find her or anyone there to answer questions or bring in ballots from the single polling location in the township.\n\n\"I don’t know what we’re going to do … we need those numbers,\" he said.\n\nVlasak, who has been clerk since 1988, said this is the first time he hasn't received a call from all polling locations with voting totals. He said everyone is due to bring election materials to his office by 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nHe said he’s concerned about going to the clerk’s home because she is sick.\n\n— Molly Beck\n\n11:53 a.m.: Scott Walker points out unlikelihood of recount impacting result\n\nNo stranger to close elections, former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker pointed out that a recount in Wisconsin would have a tall order in overcoming a 20,000-vote spread.\n\n\"After recount in 2011 race for WI Supreme Court, there was a swing of 300 votes,\" Walker tweeted. \"After recount in 2016 Presidential race in WI, @realDonaldTrump numbers went up by 131. As I said, 20,000 is a high hurdle.\"\n\nWalker lost his re-election bid in 2018 by 29,000 votes, an outcome outside the margin of 1% that allowed for a recount. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin in 2016 by 22,748 votes, a tally that gained ground after a recount requested by the campaign of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.\n\nRELATED:Trump campaign vows to seek recount as Wisconsin election officials say Joe Biden has 20,000-vote margin\n\nBiden appears to have won Wisconsin by a margin of 20,517 votes, with all precincts reported. It is within the 1% margin to allow for a recount if requested, which the Trump campaign has said it will pursue.\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\n11:33 a.m.: Officials say all votes are counted, and Biden has 20,000-vote lead\n\nAfter all the upheaval of the past year and the drama and turmoil of President Donald Trump's first term, Wisconsin once again went down to the wire in the 2020 election, with Democrat Joe Biden holding a lead of around 20,000 votes, according to unofficial returns.\n\nThat is very close to Trump's winning margin in 2016.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in early morning hours when the city of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead.\n\nTrump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\nMeagan Wolfe, the director of the state Elections Commission, told NBC News on Wednesday that all ballots have been counted, though the results have not yet been made final.\n\nRead the full story from Craig Gilbert.\n\n10:35 a.m.: Both Biden, Trump campaigns taking notice of Wisconsin's thin margin\n\nThe campaigns of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden are taking notice that Wisconsin could be headed for a recount because of its thin margin.\n\nTrump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters Wednesday that Wisconsin was in “recount territory,” just hours after Trump said he wanted all vote-counting to stop even though many legally cast ballots around the country had not yet been tallied.\n\nIn its own call with reporters, Biden aides said the former vice president was confident he would keep his lead in Wisconsin even if there is a recount. They said they believed Biden would secure the last Electoral College votes he needs as the outstanding states finalize their results in coming days.\n\nTrump could seek a recount in Wisconsin if he loses the state by less than 1 percentage point. If his loss is between a quarter of a point and 1 point he would have to pay for the recount, which would likely cost a few million dollars.\n\nBiden campaign attorney Bob Bauer called Trump’s demands to stop counting ballots extraordinary and unacceptable. He noted Republican lawmakers in states like Wisconsin didn’t allow absentee ballots to be counted before Election Day, which contributed to delays in tabulating the ballots.\n\n“They were looking to logjam that process,” Bauer said.\n\n– Patrick Marley\n\n7:40 a.m.: Are we headed for a Wisconsin recount?\n\nThe presidential race in Wisconsin looks like it will be decided by the thinnest of margins, likely putting it in recount territory.\n\nUnofficial returns in Wisconsin showed Democrat Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by about 20,000 votes as of early Wednesday. That's a tiny share of the 3.2 million votes that were cast.\n\nIf the race stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can force a recount. If the margin is larger than that, there's no chance for one.\n\nBefore any decision could be made on a recount, the official results need to be finalized over the coming weeks.\n\nA recount in 2016 resulted in few changes to the final tally in Wisconsin. That year, Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes out of about 3 million cast.\n\nRead the full story from Patrick Marley.\n\n4 a.m. Wisconsin again goes down to the wire\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden overtook Trump in early morning hours when the city of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nTrump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\nWith Biden up by around 8,000 votes, there were still votes to be reported from the city of Kenosha and Green Bay, Democratic-leaning communities.\n\nWhile Trump did worse in much of metropolitan Milwaukee and Madison than he did four years ago, he did a little better in much of northern and central Wisconsin. The urban-rural political divide widened.\n\nRead the full story from Craig Gilbert\n\n3:10 a.m. Milwaukee's 169,341 absentee ballots have been counted, results will be be reported\n\nMilwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg headed to Milwaukee County with a police escort and the results of the 169,341 absentee ballots that had been returned to the city.\n\nShe delivered the results, stored on electronic drives, to Milwaukee County Elections Director Julietta Henry.\n\nThe county will update its website with the results of the votes. Henry estimated they would be updated withiin 30 minutes — sometime before 4 a.m.\n\n—Alison Dirr\n\n1:13 a.m.: Ballot processing continues, counting expected to take a few more hours\n\nMilwaukee’s Central Count was pretty quiet around 1 a.m. as the processing continued after many of the election workers had left for the day. The whir of ballot machines had largely died down.\n\nIt’s still expected to take a few hours before the city’s 169,341 returned absentee ballots are fully processed and uploaded to the Milwaukee County website.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n12:15 p.m.: AWOL Waushara County DA ousted\n\nWaushara County will have a new district attorney after Republican Matthew Leusink beat Democrat Laura Waite.\n\nGov. Tony Evers appointed Waite to the position in April. However, just two months after her appointment, Waite stopped showing up for work and a judge appointed a special administrative prosecutor in her absence.\n\n— Natalie Brophy\n\n11:26 p.m.: Absentee ballot count expected to be finished by 3 a.m.\n\nMilwaukee County Clerk George Christenson just reported that counting of all the absentee ballots should be finished by 3 a.m.\n\nHe said Milwaukee Central Count has processed 140,000 absentee ballots with about 30,000 left to be counted, moving up the finish time by an hour or two.\n\nChristenson also said three of the eight municipalities counting their own absentee ballots have finished - Shorewood, Greendale and South Milwaukee. He expects West Allis to be done in one to 1 1/2 hours.\n\n— Meg Jones\n\n11:22 p.m.: Steil wins re-election in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District\n\nRepublican Congressman Bryan Steil declared victory over Democrat Roger Polack at a watch party at Route 20 bar and restaurant in Racine County.\n\n“Tonight we sent a message, loud and clear, that the violence that we saw in Kenosha must never happen again,“ Steil said. “Everyone has a right to feel safe. Everyone.”\n\nSteil said he will continue to “move our country forward.“\n\nHe also reminded the crowd that a lot of races haven’t been called yet in Wisconsin including the presidential race but he’s “feeling good” about Republicans chances.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n10:52 p.m.: Election observers from Europe surprised by young voters\n\nTwo election observers at Milwaukee’s central count Tuesday night had crossed the Atlantic Ocean to be there.\n\nFarah Karimi from The Netherlands and Gergely Arato of Hungary, both national-level elected officials in their respective countries, had come with the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, which the U.S. is also a member of.\n\n“It was very good to see how many good people are working for the success of the election,” Arato said, noting he encountered poll workers who care about the work they’re doing.\n\nHe was surprised by the number of young people who turned out to vote in every polling place they visited.\n\nIt was clear, they said, that the people they talked to wanted to be part of deciding who would lead the country.\n\nThe pair estimated they had visited 11 or 12 polling locations in Milwaukee and Washington counties on Tuesday before stopping by the city’s central count operation.\n\nIn Wisconsin, election observers do not need to be Wisconsin residents. They also don't have to be U.S. citizens or live in the U.S.\n\nKarimi and Arato were interested in Wisconsin not solely because the state allows international observers but also because of its status as a key swing state in the 2020 election.\n\nThe pair arrived in Milwaukee on Monday and will leave Wednesday, though they said they had been in Washington D.C. since Friday learning about election law, campaign finance and more.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n10:48 p.m.: Volunteers help out at polls in Port Washington\n\nPort Washington City Clerk Susan Westerbeke said a lot of volunteers stepped forward to work across the city’s three polling sites.\n\nShe said they brought on extra poll workers to train volunteers in advance of Election Day.\n\nWesterbeke said plenty of voters registered today, but the amount was similar to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWith the volume of absentee ballots received, Westerbeke said they’re hoping to have everything counted by 11 p.m. or midnight.\n\nShe said about 80% of absentee ballots have been processed by 8 p.m.\n\n“We didn’t have any issues with electioneering at all, or voter intimidation,” she said.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n10:35 p.m.: People in West Allis cast votes nearly two hours past closing time\n\nLong lines in West Allis meant some voters cast their ballots around 9:45 p.m., according to WISN-TV reporter Ben Jordan.\n\nAnd at least one woman was turned away as she tried to get into the line just after 8 p.m., according to WISN.\n\n“We are aware of long voting lines at several West Allis polling locations,” West Allis Mayor Dan Devine said in a tweet.\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\n10:11 p.m.: Some jurisdictions ran low on ballots, Elections Commission official says\n\nIn five counties in Wisconsin, local clerks had to request more ballots because they were running low, according to Tim Murtaugh, President Donald Trump’s campaign communications director.\n\nMurtaugh made the comments on PBS Tuesday evening.\n\nMeagan Wolfe at the state Elections Commission said there were some reports this evening of some small jurisdictions running low on ballots, but they contacted their counties and got more.\n\n\"The counties were able to get them the ballots they needed to get through the night,\" Wolfe said.\n\nShe did not say which jurisdictions asked for more ballots.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Patrick Marley\n\n9:41 p.m.: Milwaukee County Clerk reaffirms that complete results won’t be expected until early morning\n\nMilwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said 432 out of 478 polling places have reported which is typical for this time on election night.\n\n\"Things are progressing as we were expecting.\" That does not include absentee totals. \"They're still counting absentees,\" said Christenson.\n\nHe reiterated what Julietta Henry said an hour ago, that complete vote totals will not be done until \"well into the morning hours.\"\n\n— Meg Jones\n\n9:32 p.m.: Ballot workers advised not to discuss results\n\nJust before polls closed at 8 p.m., Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg cautioned workers processing ballots at the city’s central count location not to discuss the results of the election, audibly gasp or have other reactions as results start to come in.\n\nThe results from Milwaukee’s absentee ballots are expected around 4 a.m., officials said Tuesday evening.\n\nAround 7:30 p.m., it was announced that workers for the city had counted 102,310 absentee ballots out of an estimated 169,000 returned.\n\nStill outstanding were some absentee ballots from the city’s 15 drop boxes, but Mayor Tom Barrett said at a press conference that he did not expect a significant influx since the drop boxes had been emptied throughout the day.\n\nThe results from the city’s 173 polling places were sent via modem to Milwaukee County about 8 p.m. The first results released by the county will solely be from polling places.\n\n“I think it’s amazing how many people, during a pandemic, continue to believe in this country, believe in this community and want to be involved in our democratic process,” Barrett said, thanking voters who turned out Tuesday.\n\nThe absentee ballot figure will be released by the county once all the ballots have been counted, hopefully by 4 a.m.\n\nWoodall-Vogg said once the absentee count is finished, she will have a police escort to take encrypted flash drives to the county. The county will then manually load the results into the reporting software and report it all at once on the county website.\n\nWoodall-Vogg said about 4,000 poll workers in the field and at central count Tuesday “made a very smooth Election Day possible.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n8:37 p.m.: Expect to wait for final results, director says\n\nJulietta Henry, Milwaukee County Board of Elections director, announced at the county courthouse that the final results from the presidential election will not be done earlier than 5 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWorkers at the so-called “central count” location in Milwaukee began counting absentee ballots at 7 a.m. Tuesday with three shifts counting until they finish. The ballots include those mailed, put in dropboxes and cast during early in-person voting.\n\nUnder state law, the totals from absentee ballots won't be released until the very last one passes through a tabulating machine. Votes from individual polling places will be released when they're sent to the county.\n\nThe mechanical tabulators can process 1,200 to 2,000 ballots per hour. Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg expects the machines to be the busiest between 10 p.m. and whenever the final ballots are counted in the wee hours of Wednesday.\n\n— Sophie Carson, Meg Jones\n\n8:17 p.m.: Polls closed in Wauwatosa\n\nWauwatosa officials came to Hart Park at 7:45 p.m. to collect the final absentee ballots that were dropped off there, as the ballots had to be at central count at city hall by 8 p.m.\n\nThere were 2 ballots inside, as the last pick-up of ballots was around 6 p.m. It’s about a 7 minute drive to city hall from the park. The city also closed the drop box it has at city hall at 7:45 p.m.\n\nThe city has counted around 20,000 of the absentee 24,000 ballots so far, per city officials. There are around 34,000 registered voters in the city.\n\nIn September, the city said they’d need around 50 more poll workers to help count absentee ballots. Twenty Wauwatosa high school students helped with the central county operation today as well.\n\nVoter turnout in the city for the 2016 election was at 89%.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n8:15 p.m.: Voters confused about polling site location\n\nDozens of people showed up at Zablocki Library on Election Day, thinking they could vote there, when their polling place was elsewhere.\n\nZablocki Library was a polling place on Election Day, but only voters living in two certain wards could vote there. Before Tuesday, the library was used as an early voting site, open to any eligible voters in the city.\n\n“I think there has been some confusion because when they had early voting, if they were in different wards, they could still come here,” said Chief Inspector Linda Leaf. “But for today, … they have to go to their regular polling site.”\n\nThe polling place had a couple of poll workers at a time stationed outside the library Tuesday, asking voters for their address and checking if they were at the right polling place.\n\nMike McBride, a poll worker at Zablocki, estimated he had to direct about 40 voters to other polling places.\n\nA total of 250 voters had cast a ballot on Election Day at Zablocki Library as of 6:15 p.m., Leaf said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n8:09 p.m.: Few late voters spotted at Sholes Campus School / Donald W. Reagan high school\n\nTwenty minutes before polls close, there are very few voters coming to Sholes Campus School / Donald W. Reagan high school.\n\nElections inspector Jack Gaboury said they had lines with about 40 people or about half an hour wait early morning but then things slowed down. Gaboury estimated that half the voters cast their ballots by mail or during early voting.\n\nThere wasn’t an after 5 p.m. voting rush. They’ve had plenty of poll workers, including two who speak Spanish and about five observers total.\n\nJesus Gonzalez, 18, voted there just a few minutes before the polls closing time. He voted for Biden. He says he wants as president someone who can take care of the epidemic and keep the country together, “not separated by racism.”\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n8:06 p.m.: Cudahy official reports high voter turnout\n\nAfter voting at South Milwaukee’s city hall at about 6:20 p.m., Brandon Kowalski said both presidential candidates said some “messed up” things but he went with the current president for a second term. “I like Trump better,” he said.\n\nKowalski also voted for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nSimilarly, South Milwaukee resident Rebecca Pappalardo said she voted for Trump because of his “achievements” and “promises kept.” She also voted for him in 2016.\n\nLeisa Jean, also from South Milwaukee, wasn’t able to vote in 2016 because she was out of the country. Jean called the 2020 presidential race “significant, dramatic and emotional.” The voting experience in South Milwaukee was overall pleasant and well coordinated, she said. However, Jean did take issue with how close people had to get at the registration table. Jean didn’t want to say outright who she voted for, but said in some countries “socialism isn’t a bad word.” However, she said that system may not work in a country like the United States.\n\nIn neighboring Cudahy, resident Ed Owczarek also stuck with his previous party vote in 2016 and voted for Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Owczarek said the biggest issues this election are the pandemic and economy.\n\nCudahy’s Director of Office Services Kelly Sobieski said turnout has been strong and while she doesn’t have the exact numbers yet, “it’s a safe bet” that Cudahy’s voter turnout is around 90%. She said the city does traditionally have a high turnout for presidential elections, however, so she doesn’t think this is a record setting year.\n\nSobieski received high praise from first-time poll worker Karen Martin. After seeing numerous ads asking for help, Martin took time off work and decided to volunteer. She said she was very impressed with Sobieski who helped her to learn the ropes.\n\n“Her planning was stellar,” Martin said.\n\nOne thing that stood out to Martin was how in-depth the process was which she said you can’t know until you’re working behind the scenes. The “terror of missing one pink slip” is real, she said while taking a quick puff of a cigarette on a break. She called the whole experience “incredible and very emotional.”\n\n“If my two hands and 10 hours of time can help get it done and get it done well, I’ll do it,” she said.\n\nDespite the stress, Martin said she would volunteer to work the polls again “without a doubt.”\n\n— Erik Hanley\n\n7:56 p.m.: A few late Madison voters make it to polls\n\nAt Steamfitters Local 601 in Madison, only a few voters made their way into the polling place in the final hour before polls closed. Chief inspector Hayden Stone said about 2,700 people voted at the location in person, and poll workers processed an additional 3,300 absentee ballots. It was a busy day, but the line was gone by 7 p.m., surprising for a polling place hosting 9 wards. Stone said the day went smoothly, no issues with electioneering or bad attitudes.\n\n“The general attitude was way more lighthearted than anticipated,” he said. “The number of excited people was higher than usual.”\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n7:55 p.m.: Roughly 300 people go through polling site’s doors\n\nCatherine McCoy, the chief election inspector at the Milwaukee Housing Authority, said they had roughly 300 people come through their doors. “Turnout has been better than expected,” she said. The location serves two wards.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n7:39 p.m.: Postal Service disregards court order to do ballot sweeps in Wisconsin, other swing states\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service disregarded a federal judge's order Tuesday to sweep mail processing facilities serving 15 states, including Wisconsin.\n\nThe agency said late Tuesday it would instead stick to its own inspection schedule.\n\n\"Defendants have been working to comply with this Court's Order, which requires a 'sweep' of postal facilities within several specified districts, while recognizing the limitations caused by time and the Postal Service's pre-existing Postal Inspection processes,\" the U.S.P.S. response read. \"As of the time of this filing, that process remains ongoing.\"\n\nThe agency has disclosed that more than 300,000 ballots nationwide could not be traced.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza, Cary Spivak\n\n7:21 p.m.: Lines fade away in Shorewood as Election Night continues\n\nLines were long to start the day at both Shorewood polling locations, but nonexistent by 6:30 p.m at the Shorewood Village Center.\n\nVillage Clerk Sara Bruckman said absentee ballots were over half processed by 2:30 p.m.\n\nA woman from the district attorney’s office was called to the voting site early afternoon to inform a man holding a Biden sign that he was too close to the building, said Beth Hengst, a greeter at the village center.\n\nHegnst said the man cooperated, and asked for a map to see the nearest distance he could hold the sign at.\n\nHengst started her shift at 2 p.m. and noted that most voters have been college students who weren’t registered to vote.\n\nMonica Glowacz, a 24-year-old nursing student, voted for the first time. She preferred not to share her vote, but said she voted for a different party than her family.\n\n“Before, I was more influenced by my family, but now I grew up so I definitely have my own opinions,” said Glowacz.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n7:14 p.m.: Kerry Washington’s tweet puts Milwaukee in spotlight\n\nActress, producer, and director Kerry Washington tweeted “All eyes are on Milwaukee right now!!!!!!! You have the power. Sooooo much power. Polls close at 8pm!!! Let's gooooooooooo!” and tagged the Wisconsin Democrats’ Twitter account shortly before 7 p.m.\n\nShe included a video with her tweet, which had been watched more than 37,000 times by 7:10 p.m.\n\nWashington has 5.4 million Twitter followers.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\n7 p.m.: Inspector praises voter turnout at North Division High School\n\nChief Election Inspector Karen Thomas at the North Division High School polling location said about 70 voters have come through and they have had seven election observers throughout the day. “I think the turnaround was good all the way around,” she said.\n\nNorth Division High School, too, saw some fresh faces at the polls this year.\n\nGabriella Ingram turned 18 in September and said she was coming out to vote because, “I want Joe Biden in office ... because I want Trump out.”\n\nJames Ingram, her older brother, is voting in his second election.In 2016, he voted for Clinton and is sticking with the Democratic candidate this time too. “I’m a schoolteacher and I’m worried about a lot of people during this election,” he said.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n6:55 p.m.: Barnes and Crowley make final push to get people to polls\n\nLt. Governor Mandela Barnes and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley made plea a little after 6 p.m. for voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots.\n\nCrowley urged voters to head to their poll stations, saying that as long as they are in line before 8 o’clock they can still cast their ballots.\n\n“Please, make sure to let your voice be heard,” he said.\n\nBarnes repeated the plea: “If you have not gone to vote yet, please do so.”\n\nBarnes said he doesn’t have any estimated ranges for the turnout in Milwaukee or Wisconsin, but that he is confident in Wisconsin voters.\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n6:32 p.m.: National Guard members deployed to help at polls\n\nAbout 220 National Guard members were deployed to Wisconsin’s polls to fill in as poll workers, and another 200 are available as backups if more are needed tonight, according to the state Elections Commission.\n\nAt a virtual news conference this evening, commission director Meagan Wolfe said no major poll worker shortages or other problems at the polls have been reported so far today.\n\nResults are expected to come in late because of the nearly 2 million absentee ballots that need to be counted. Milwaukee’s results aren’t expected until 3 a.m. at the earliest.\n\n“If unofficial results aren’t available until tomorrow morning, it doesn’t mean anything went wrong,” Wolfe said. “Our election inspectors, they’re going to continue to value accuracy over speed.”\n\nOf nearly 2 million absentee ballots submitted in Wisconsin, about 970 had some kind of deficiency that could prevent them from being counted, according to the state’s top elections official.\n\nThat’s just a small percentage of the overall absentee ballots in the state.\n\nWhen voters submit absentee ballots, they must be enclosed in an envelope that includes their signature, the signature of a witness and the address of the witness. Without all three, the ballot won’t be counted.\n\nClerks often alert voters well before Election Day if there are problems on their ballot envelopes so they can fix them.\n\nWolfe said some of the approximately 970 absentee ballots with problems may be fixed before polls close at 8 p.m.\n\n— Patrick Marley\n\n6:29 p.m.: Election inspector highlights strong voter turnout\n\nFor Chief Election Inspector Georgia Collins, November at Washington Park Library marks her 33rd year working in elections. This year, she said, turnout has been high.\n\n“The turnout is beautiful, it was better than Obama’s (election),” she said. “And they got these kids out here and that’s what I want.”\n\nShe said most of the day has gone smoothly, and she has no worries about voting, although she hopes there are no more disruptions outside the building.\n\nA speeding car, followed by several police vehicles, crashed on West Lisbon Avenue around 6 p.m. Collins said the crash drew all the attention of voters inside and outside the building.\n\n“I’m just worried about the street activities,” she said, pointing in the direction of the wrecked car. “I don’t want no fights, no fires.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n6:18 p.m.: Green Bay total approaches 2016 level\n\nVoters in the city of Green Bay had cast nearly 40,000 ballots as of 4 p.m. Tuesday, Mayor Eric Genrich said; the total of 39,298 is roughly 70% of the number of registered voters in the city.\n\nAll ballots cast, including early and Election Day voting, will be counted before poll workers end their workday, the mayor said. He expected that the count will continue at least until early Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We're making good progress,\" he said. \"But we still have a ways to go.\"\n\nThe vote total of absentee ballots and those cast Tuesday by 4 p.m. equated to about 84% of the total cast in the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton election in 2016.\n\nOne of multiple tallying machines being used to count ballots experienced a jam early in the day. Genrich said a technician from the company that manufactures the machines was able to repair the problem.\n\n— Doug Schneider\n\n6:15 p.m.: Kosciuszko Community Center sees steady stream of voters\n\nChief inspector Terry Longo said that at most they have had a line with three to four people at Kosciuszko Community Center.\n\nHe said they have been busy though, with over 300 people voting today.\n\nLongo said they have had 13 observers, and plenty of poll workers, some of whom speak Spanish.\n\nOne pers, Precious Jimenez, voted for her first time. She says it made her feel good and important.\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n6:05 p.m.: She brought her sealed ballot and dog\n\nDiana Lopez showed up at Milwaukee German Immersion School ready to drop off her ballot in a sealed envelope.\n\nShe was told by poll workers that those could only be returned in drop boxes, but if Lopez wanted she could vote in-person and they would destroy her sealed ballot.\n\nNo big deal, she just needed to go home a few blocks away to get her photo ID.\n\n“That’s why it wasn’t a problem,” Lopez said. “I’m sure if somebody else had to do that, they probably would not have.”\n\nSo Lopez left with her young daughter and tiny dog, after some petting by a poll worker, then returned five minutes later.\n\nAfter waiting in line about 20 minutes, Lopez voted in the school’s gymnasium, dog in tow.\n\n“She’s a corgipoo,” Lopez said. “She’s only seven months old.”\n\nShe came out still with her sealed ballot.\n\n“They said I could destroy it at home,” Lopez said.\n\n— Ben Steele\n\n5:49 p.m.: Lines calm down, voting goes smoothly at Kenosha Bible Church\n\nThe line at Kenosha Bible Church stretched down the block before the polls opened. But, eventually, that morning crowd calmed down, and the day went smoothly for poll workers and voters.\n\nKhris Bellaire recently moved and had to reregister.\n\n“I’ve probably been here 10, maybe 15 minutes but only because I had to register,” Bellaire said.\n\nGoing into Election Day, Bellaire said he “wasn’t really swayed on both sides,” but ended up voting for Donald Trump.\n\n“Just because of the things he’s done and the things he said he was going to do versus Biden who hasn’t really done anything in the whole 47 years he’s been in office,” Bellaire said adding his vote was both for Trump and against Biden. “I was giving both the benefit of the doubt… I just can’t wait for it to be over now.“\n\nStacy Delaney said the voting process was easy but this election has been emotional for her.\n\n“I supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries, I was a little disappointed with Joe Biden,“ Delaney said. “but not disappointed enough to not vote for him. I don’t think I can take four more years of Donald Trump.“\n\nDavid Mendlik said the voting was “smooth and painless.”\n\n“You got to go through all the weeds, find what you think is true and what you think is right and vote with your gut,” Mendlik said on how he viewed this election.\n\nMendlik didn’t want to say who he supported in the presidential election “because of all the fallout that’s predicted by the Democrats.“\n\n“Every time they’ve talked they said if Trump wins there’s going to be chaos and protests and riots,“ Mendlik said. ”In this day and age we have to take that kind of stuff serious.“\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n5:49 p.m.: Souls to the Polls finds success in other states\n\nThe Souls to the Polls operation offering free rides to Milwaukee voters has gone national.\n\nCoordinator Norma Balentine said her volunteers have booked Uber and Lyft rides for voters in New Haven, Connecticut, and St. Louis – in addition to the dozens booked in Milwaukee – after callers in other states found their number online.\n\nSouls volunteers fielded several calls for rides, in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Minnesota and elsewhere. They initially turned callers away, but then decided, “why not?” said Balentine.\n\nThe volunteers staffing the Souls to the Polls’ Zoom-based call center also come from all over – places like Illinois, California and even Alaska.\n\nJeff Powers was taking calls at his home in Palmer, Alaska, a solidly Republican area about 40 miles outside of Anchorage. A geologist and environmental consultant, Powers had planned to travel to Milwaukee and offer free rides to voters. But he was persuaded to help online instead because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Voters in Wisconsin have more power,” he said. “I wanted to apply my resources in an area where I could make a difference.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n5:20 p.m.: Voters want their ballots to count\n\nThere’s a new image emerging in this year’s election: the persistent voter.\n\nOrganizers and volunteers with the faith-based coalition Common Ground said they worked with several voters Tuesday who were determined to cast their ballots, despite barriers that in the past might have caused them to give up.\n\n“The overall trend I’ve seen today is people just being so persistent in voting,” said Jennifer O’Hear, executive director of Common Ground, which has more than 150 volunteers working to get out the vote on Tuesday, including poll protection teams at several sites aimed at ensuring everyone who turned out to vote got to do so.\n\n“I can’t believe how many people who got sent home to get more information and they came back,” she said. “Or people who were sent to two and three different polling sites.”\n\n“We were busy all day with people who needed help,” she said.\n\nIn one case, an attorney had to intervene after a poll worker at Hillside Family Resource Center told a voter she’d have to go home and find her absentee ballot, O’Hear said. In another, at Starms Discovery Learning Center, volunteers worked with the Department of Motor Vehicles to get an emailed copy of a voter’s ID, which had been lost with his wallet.\n\nZipporah Turnbull, who worked to troubleshoot problems for several voters at Starms, said one man was turned away because he’d moved and didn’t have proof of his new address. She urged him to go home and scour his house for paperwork. “He was really down when he left. But he came back,” she said. “I told him, ‘we’re going to do this together,’” she said. “He made my day.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n4:53 p.m.: Voces de la Frontera sends in translators\n\nWhen a church voting site in a Latino neighborhood in Waukesha opened without Spanish speaking poll workers, Voces de la Frontera sent two election observers in to help with translating, said Voces spokeswoman Jacquelyn Kovarik. The observers remained at the Evangelical & Reformed United Church of Christ throughout the day.\n\n— John Fauber\n\n4:47 p.m.: 'I just want to see change come about'\n\nEbony Shelton voted in 2016 for Clinton and said that she felt the precautions were safe enough that she could vote in person this during this presidential election.\n\n“I just felt that it was very important and there’s a lot at stake,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she believes that Biden “has our best interest at heart” and also said, “I hope he can continue with some of the things that Obama had going.”\n\nTrump, she said, 'didn't align with my personal values.'\n\n“Anytime you take a stab at someone for what they believe, that does it for me.\"\n\nMarie Hyde said voting on Election Day was a tradition for her.\n\n“I (voted) to make a difference. If one vote would do it, I want it to be mine,” she said.\n\nShe voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and said she was voting for Biden because she likes what he says. She also described his choice of Kamala Harris, the first woman of Black and Indian ancestry to run on a major ticket, was “beautiful.”\n\nOn Trump, she said, “He ain't s***,” later adding, “I just want to see a change come about.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n4:44 p.m.: Oconomowoc negotiates unusual election\n\nIn the city of Oconomowoc, Clerk Diane Coenen said this election is the first time she has had observers at all four of her polling locations who spent the entire day there.\n\n“Typically if I get one observer, they don’t necessarily stay the entire day,” Coenen said. “Right now, they’re there for the entire day.”\n\nCoenen also said the city had some voters with COVID-19 who voted curbside. While poll workers have PPE available, one told Coenen they were uncomfortable with it.\n\n“Even though they have garb and face masks on, now they’ve touched the ballot, you put the ballot in the machine and now that ballot with potential germs is in with other ballots. At the end of the night you’re handling those ballots. It’s a little concerning for them. They feel that is not something they should have to do, especially when the voter in their vehicle is not wearing a mask.”\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n4:41 p.m.: City official: 'What's really important to me is that America stop being so angrily divided'\n\nLafayette Crump, Milwaukee’s Commissioner of City Development, was at the South Division High School poll site this afternoon.\n\n“What’s really important to me is that America stop being so angrily divided” he said. “I am also worried about some of the language that’s stoked the idea that patiently counting votes means something nefarious is going on.\"\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\n4:41 p.m.: Community confusion around Mitchell Street Library location\n\nMore than 50 people showed up at the Mitchell Street Library on election day thinking they could vote there, apparently not knowing that it was only an early voting site that had stopped accepting votes on Saturday, according to Jacquelyn Kovarik, a spokeswoman for Voces de la Frontera.\n\nVoces stationed couple of its workers at the library who helped voters find the correct place to vote.\n\n\"There clearly was confusion in the community,\" she said.\n\n— John Fauber\n\n4:39 p.m.: Trump yard signs doused with gasoline in Racine, homeowner says\n\nAccording to the Racine Journal Times, a Racine resident's yard signs supporting President Donald Trump were doused in gasoline early Tuesday morning.\n\nFootage of the incident, captured on a doorbell camera, shows a man pouring what the Journal Times reported was gasoline on several Trump signs staked into the home’s front yard on Ohio Street.\n\nThe man also poured gasoline down the side of the house, knocked over a flag pole and broke a light in the yard, according to the Journal Times.\n\nThe man did not set the signs or house on fire, running away instead, homeowner Tom Marquis told the newspaper.\n\nMarquis’s friend and neighbor, Marco Diaz, noticed the damage Tuesday morning and alerted Marquis. Diaz’s yard is full of signs supporting Joe Biden for president, and on Halloween, the two dressed up as their presidential picks to hand out candy to trick-or-treaters.\n\n—Sophie Carson\n\n4:33 p.m.: Milwaukee musical duo Sista Strings brings joy to the polls in Bay View, part of national venture\n\nJoy to the Polls, a group of non-partisan election observers, have positioned music groups across the nation near polling places to make voting more joyful.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the organization used local band Sista Strings to bring joy to voters at Fernwood Montessori School in Bay View.\n\nThe Joy to the Polls has deployed various nationally recognizable musicians, including rapper Busta Rhymes and singer Patti Smith, to polling locations in New York, Florida and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nJoy to the Polls was also playing music for early voting, which spurred a viral dance party at a polling place in Philadelphia.\n\n— Jordyn Noennig\n\n4:30 p.m.: Adult site offers free memberships to Wisconsin voters\n\nGiving new meaning to the term “swing state,” a national adult hook-up site is offering free Gold memberships to new subscribers who vote Tuesday in 13 key states, including Wisconsin.\n\nAdultFriendFinder is offering its “Swinging in the Swing States” promotion to voters in hotly contested states. To redeem their free memberships, voters can submit photos of themselves with their “I Voted” sticker or a photo of themselves waiting in line at a polling location to swingvotes@ffn.com.\n\nThe company says it already has more than 1 million Wisconsin subscribers.\n\n“Swinging has always been a team activity,” FriendFinder Networks spokesman Gunner Taylor said in a news release. “And we’re hoping to inspire our community to tap into that team mentality to encourage high voter turnout for this year’s election, particularly in the crucial swing states.”\n\nWisconsin law prohibits giving people anything of value in exchange for them voting or not voting.\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n4:24 p.m.: Confusion at museum polling places in Kenosha\n\nThe Kenosha Public Museum and Civil War Museum are less than 50 yards apart but they are also polling places, which has caused some confusion with voters in the city.\n\n“It was the worst voting experience I ever had,” Bryant Banks said. Banks added he checked online to make sure he was registered to vote before going to the polls on Tuesday but when he arrived at the Civil War Museum he was told he wasn’t registered. He had to go to the public museum to register.\n\nHe registered and went back to the Civil War Museum to vote. There was some confusion as to which museum he was supposed to cast his vote but eventually it was settled.\n\n“What’s the point of having people check online if they’re registered to vote if when they got here they can’t vote and have to re-register,” Banks said.\n\n“It seems like it’s set up to have people not vote.” Banks said he saw multiple people walk back and forth between the two buildings. “It’s just chaotic,” Banks said. “It just seems not well put together. And I don’t know if that’s on purpose or not on purpose. It just needs to be done better. “\n\nJocelyn Aguirre’s normal polling place was moved to the Civil War Museum but she went into the public museum by mistake.\n\n“It was a different location than what I’m used to which was a little confusing at first,“ Aguirre said. “I didn’t realize there are two separate museums. I just saw the word ‘museum’ and figured ‘OK this must be it.’”\n\nHowever, some people were able to vote at one of the museums without a problem.\n\n“It’s the first time I’ve been in the museum it looks great,” said John Pellamolla who voted at the Civil War Museum.\n\nEarlier in the day many people were arriving at the Kenosha Municipal Building thinking it was a polling place.\n\n“We do our best to redirect them to where they need to go,” said City Clerk Matt Kauter. The municipal building is being used to count absentee ballots.\n\nKrauter said the city received nearly 30,000 early and absentee ballots before Election Day and anticipated the workers will count about 47,000 ballots in a city with roughly 53,000 registered voters.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n4:18 p.m.: Two cast first votes for Trump\n\nBoth Elizabeth Rosado, 34, and Par Cung, 42, voted in their first presidential election Tuesday at the Lyons Park polling site.\n\nThey both cast their vote for Donald Trump.\n\nRosado said in Spanish she voted for Trump for religious reasons and because she is against abortion. Cung pointed to high taxes and said she trusted Trump to keep the country great.\n\n“I like to work. I’m very hardworking,” said Cung, who is originally from Burma. “I work so much but I pay too much in taxes.”\n\nSara Flores, 30, voted for Joe Biden, who she hopes will unify the country and better address the pandemic.\n\n“For me the biggest thing is the school system,” she said, adding it isn’t working for some students and parents during the pandemic.\n\nA mother of four, Flores said she feels torn between her roles as a mom, a wife and a school employee.\n\nHer kids are struggling, she said, especially her 6-year-old who has special needs. She worries that if he doesn’t get the supports he needs now, at a young age, he will suffer more down the line.\n\n“They’re not getting what they need,” she said.\n\nShe’s stuck asking herself should she stay at her job or quit.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n4:15 p.m.: People vote early at Rufus King High School\n\nAt the Rufus King High School polling site, Chief Elections Inspector Vicki Robinson, said people showed up as early as 6:30 a.m.\n\n\"It was social-distanced, no one was complaining, everyone was mellow,\" she said.\n\nThe site had seen 334 voters so far and six election observers. She said a lot of people have come with mail to show their address and they've also signed up a lot of new voters.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n4:11 p.m.: Hoan Bridge light show will match election results\n\nOn Election Night, let there be light.\n\nWhether its blue or red will depend on the results.\n\nLight the Hoan, a community-driven effort that resulted in LED light displays unveiled on the Hoan Bridge in Milwaukee last month, is coordinating a light show to match the election results as they're called Tuesday night: blue for states that go Democrat, red for Republican — and some red, white and blue to represent the good ole' USA.\n\nThe lights will be going from dusk until 2 a.m., but folks who can't get out to the bridge tonight can watch a 15-minute light show live on the Light the Hoan Facebook page at 9 p.m.\n\n— Piet Levy\n\n4:06 p.m.: Delafield running smoothly\n\nCity of Delafield Clerk Steve Braatz said the day has been “oddly quiet.”\n\n“We haven’t had major issues, complaints and things that usually arise with a presidential election,” Braatz said.\n\nThough right when the polls opened this morning, Braatz said there were 200 people in line.\n\n“They got them through in about 45 minutes.”\n\nBraatz expected all ballots to be counted shortly after polls close.\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n4:06 p.m.: Waukesha keeps collecting ballots\n\nAs of 4 p.m., the Schuetze Center in Waukesha had collected close to 1,850 ballots, including absentees, or 87 percent of previously registered voters.\n\nThough hardly what anyone would call a crowd, by 4:30 p.m. the Schuetze Center in Waukesha began seeing lines, at least for the city’s traditionally busy 5th ward. The lines still only stretched a half-dozen deep, moving people through the voting process in about five minutes.\n\nAt 5 p.m., Waukesha’s Schuetze Center began forming longer lines, resulting in 15-minute waits for some voters. The line outside the activity room door was partly the result of new voter registrants. Chief inspector John Kelling said the polling place topped the 90 percent mark of ballots cast among existing registered voters, with three hours left.\n\n6:05 p.m: Why they're voting in person\n\nFor voters at the Schuetze Recreation Center in Waukesha, the decision to trek to the polls instead of voting absentee was a combination of doing what they’re familiar with or not trusting the advanced voting options.\n\nLinda Schroeder felt more comfortable voting Tuesday “because I’m old and I don’t understand the absentee ballots,” she said, laughing. She declined to say who she ultimately voted for, adding only “the person I wanted.”\n\nMarcia Arzamendi had too little confidence in the absentee option.\n\n“I just want to make sure my vote is counted,” Arzamendi said, openly questioning the legitimacy of the push for absentee voting this year.\n\nShe voted Republican, including Donald Trump, who she said needs more time in office.\n\n“I still think he has a lot of ideas that he hasn’t had time to finish,” she said. “So another four years will be good for him. That’s what I think.”\n\nJavin Bradley also was unsure about the reliability of absentee votes and preferred to physically insert his ballot into the counting machine.\n\n“I felt it was important to come out in person, just to do my duty,” Bradley said. “I was unsure if I did it the absentee way if it would get lost in the mail. I did it in person. I saw it go into the machine.”\n\n— James Riccioli\n\n4:01 p.m.: Greendale voters go, go, go\n\nVoters may be waiting in long lines in neighboring West Allis and Greenfield, but that's not the case in Greendale.\n\nAs of mid-afternoon, there've been no lines to speak of, said Greendale Village Clerk Melanie Pietruszka, other than the lines forming before the polls opened.\n\n\"We are not seeing too many lines at all,\" she said. \"I would say at the most it's been like five people in line.\"\n\nAbout 64% of Greendale voters cast their ballots either via absentee or early voting, Pietruszka said.\n\nShe said she did receive one complaint from a voter about campaign signs being too close to the polling location at the Greendale Safety Center, but it was checked out and deemed legal.\n\n\"They're actually outside of that 100 feet from the entrance, so they are good,\" she said. \"It's just that a voter wasn't comfortable with how close they were.\"\\\n\n— Bob Dohr\n\n3:59 p.m.: Nuns visit poll sites in Milwaukee\n\nWearing bright yellow “Election Defender” sweaters and traveling in cars painted with the slogan, “Every Vote is Sacred,” more than 30 Catholic nuns are touring poll sites in Milwaukee and Detroit.\n\nTheir efforts are a part of a nonpartisan campaign to ensure that every polling location is safe and accessible for everyone.\n\n“I think that because this year our country is more divided than ever, there is potential for anger, violence and intimidation,” said Sister Janet Weyker with Racine Dominican Sisters, in Racine.\n\nAs of mid-afternoon, however, it’s been peaceful in Milwaukee. The sisters met briefly with voters at Humboldt Park where they were welcomed by other Election Defender volunteers.\n\nMany of the sisters are elderly, and coming from communities that have been following strict COVID-19 measures, they’ve been cut off from their social justice work.\n\n“It’s been a challenging time for us,” said Mary Kay Dobrovolny, a Sister of Mercy from Detroit. “Sisters can’t show up in the world the way that we’re used to. This caravan has given us a way to tell voters we’re here for them.”\n\nThe organization Nuns & Nones organized the partnership between Election Defenders and the sisters and has accompanied them on the caravans.\n\n“Sisters continue to teach me what it means to take action from a place of deep love,” says Nuns & Nones Co-director Brittany Koteles, who joined the caravan in Wisconsin. “I hope we can continue to inspire one another into more creative, courageous action.”\n\nOn Monday, Nuns & Nones and NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice organized more than 500 sisters and allies to sign letters to Secretaries of States in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, stressing the importance of counting all votes and urging their efforts to create a fair election.\n\n“Every single vote is sacred and must be cast and counted in this election,” said Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. “The Nuns on the Bus spoke with hundreds of people across this country who have felt unheard for too long. The votes of the unemployed, those worried about losing their healthcare, or people grieving the loss of a loved one from COVID19 must be counted.”\n\nThe sisters say they’re worried about the potential for post-election civil unrest.\n\n“Obviously, half the population is going to be upset. There are going to be a lot of people who are hurting, I think, on both sides,” Weyker said.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\n3:53 p.m.: People gather on Locust Street holding signs supporting Black Lives Matter\n\nAbout 15 Cambridge Woods neighbors who live near Riverside High School, a polling site, gathered along Locust Street this afternoon as they have every weekday since early June.\n\nThey waved signs supporting Black Lives Matter, ending racism and “voting 4 equality,” as cars honked in support.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\n3:46 p.m.: Smooth sailing in Elm Grove\n\nThe clerk for the Village of Elm Grove said poll workers will likely finish counting their absentee ballots at around 7 p.m. Tuesday night. “We’ll be done on time,\" village clerk Michelle Luedtke said. \"I'll be pleased to get those results transferred to the county, hopefully right at 8:00.”\n\nLuedtke said they'd received around 3,600 absentee ballots before Election Day, or %72 of the 5,029 registered voters in the village. Around 32 poll workers were working the polls on Tuesday. Five Wisconsin National Guard members were also working the polls, many counting absentee ballots.\n\nLuedtke said the United States Postal Service was also dropping off absentee ballots one by one at village hall when they received them in the mail Tuesday, and would be doing so throughout the day. \"We already had our major mail run, so everything else is just going to be a slow trickle,\" she said.\n\nThere were longer lines in the morning when polls opened up at 7 a.m., but no lines were seen at village hall at 1 p.m. Tuesday. All voters in Elm Grove vote at Village Hall. Half of the wards vote upstairs, while the other half votes downstairs. Luedtke says a poll worker is cleaning every voting machine after it's used. She's also been helping out with the cleaning. \"I've cleaned so much my hands are starting to crack,\" she said.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n3:43 p.m.: Testing and voting lines in Madison\n\nIn Madison, the line for the COVID-19 testing site at Alliant Energy Center was about 2.5 hours long at 3 pm, according to a sign near the entrance. By comparison, voters at the Steamfitters Local 601 on the far east side were waiting around 5 to 10 minutes in line to cast their votes at 3:30 pm. The Steamfitters location is serving the most wards in the city at 9.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n3:28p.m.: Spotting misprints in Appleton\n\nAt a table inside St. Matthew Lutheran Church in Appleton, two poll workers went through stacks of absentee ballots early Tuesday afternoon, recreating any affected by a misprint so they could be counted.\n\n“Our job is to make sure every one of these is correct and to make sure that we get them all in the computer before the night is over,” said Louise Miller, a poll worker at the church.\n\nThe misprint on as many as 13,000 Outagamie County ballots is visible in a black square — known as a timing mark — near the edge of the form. The misprint is small, but still large enough that machines used to scan ballots can't accurately read them.\n\nTo make sure those votes are still counted, poll workers have to duplicate unreadable ballots by transferring votes to a new ballot that can be read by the machine. The process requires two workers and typically takes about four minutes per ballot, according to Outagamie County Clerk Lori O'Bright, who first announced the misprint in mid-October.\n\nOutagamie County had hoped the Wisconsin Supreme Court would allow poll workers to simply fill in the imperfection, a quicker solution to the problem, but the court refused to take the case.\n\n\"Our message to the voting public is this: Your vote will be counted,\" O'Bright said in mid-October after the issue with the ballots was discovered.\n\nAt St. Matthew, Miller was confident the added task wouldn't be a problem for poll workers, including a National Guard member at the site helping process the ballots.\n\n\"If we stay calm, stay focused, we're going to get it done,\" she said.\n\n— Mark Treinen\n\n3:15 p.m.: A busy morning in Pewaukee\n\nBarb Consigny, an election inspector for the city of Pewaukee, said they were “extremely busy this morning.” As of 3 p.m., 612 people voted today at city hall.\n\n“I think (that number) is down quite a bit because in the past we didn’t have that many people encouraged to vote early,” Consigny said.\n\nConsigny said the only issue they had was people who were sent absentee ballots in the mail and didn’t fill them out.\n\n“I had to verify with the city clerk that they haven’t sent (the ballots) in,” Consigny said. “Then they gave me permission to allow them to vote here.”\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n3:15 p.m.: Mother of twins: This election 'means everything'\n\nZamaris Rodriguez brought her father, Pedro Rodriguez, to vote to Longfellow School after she herself voted at another location. She says this election “means everything.”\n\nShe thinks Trump hasn’t done enough to control the epidemic. Kids aren’t in school and people aren’t working, she said. She is a single mom and works 11 p.m. until 7 a.m. as a front desk clerk at a motel so that she can help her twins, 11, with remote learning.\n\n“I want them to be somebody,\" she said.\n\nShe voted for Biden. She thinks that Trump should have done more. When he got sick, she said, a helicopter took him to the hospital.\n\n“We don’t have any of those privileges,” she said. “We don’t have any of those resources.”\n\nRodriguez expects the president who gets elected to treat low-income residents the same way that the wealthy. She thinks Trump has been picking on Hispanics and doesn’t like how he refers to the coronavirus as the China virus. She thinks he is now also picking on Chinese people.\"\n\n— Maria Jesus Perez Sanchez\n\n3:10 p.m.: DJs from 'Amp the Vote' add to atmosphere at Milwaukee polls\n\nThe voting line at Marshall High School in mid-afternoon was sparse, but that didn’t stop the party vibe.\n\nIn the parking lot, DJ Andre Wallace was setting up his turntables.\n\nWallace was there as part of “Amp The Vote,” an initiative spearheaded by Milwaukee Action Intersection.\n\nThe MIA is a support group borne out of the social-justice protests over the summer.\n\n“Many of us were like ‘We need to take care of each other,’“ said Vanessa Parker, a 35-year-old member of MIA. “We started out having meals together and out of that came ‘We can’t march every day.’ That’s not sustainable. Some of had jobs.”\n\nSo they kicked around ideas for events and decided on “Amp The Vote” after seeing how music helped voters in long lines during last April’s election.\n\n“We wanted to make voting fun,” Parker said.\n\nDJs were found using social media. Wallace stumbled on the gig on a DJ Facebook group.\n\n“Amp The Vote” was also at the Center Street Library, Riverside High School and South Division High School polling locations.\n\n“No matter what you’re walking to the poll with or any thoughts you have,” said Kelsey Boyle, a 28-year-old member of MIA. “As you walk by and hear just the party music and good tunes, those negative thoughts don’t stick around and you leave feeling a little lighter.”\n\nWallace was playing at Marshall from 2 to 5 p.m. He just wanted to keep the positive vibes going.\n\n“Got some funk, R&B,” he said. “Like kick-back hip-hop.”\n\nWallace was plugged in and ready to go. He kicked things off with some Busta Rhymes, then Mary J. Blige and Mark Morrison’s eternal people-pleaser “Return of the Mack.”\n\n— Ben Steele\n\n2:50 p.m.: Watch 3 p.m. press conference from Central Count in Milwaukee\n\nAs the ballot counting continues, Milwaukee officials will host a 3 p.m. press conference from Central Count in Milwaukee. Watch the stream below.\n\nSpeaking of Central Count, want to know what it looks like inside the 70,000-square foot space, formerly insurance offices?\n\n2:45 p.m.: Poll worker said her worries of voter intimidation proved unfounded\n\nCarol Jones, the chief election inspector at the New Beginnings Are Possible site, said, “It has been really busy. So far, so good.”\n\nShe said that about 302 voters have come and gone and she has more than enough poll workers and six election observers for both parties.\n\nAbbie Childs, a 22-year-old poll worker said she was initially concerned about voter intimidation, but has not had to report any incidents so far. “I was worried, especially with this being a Democratic stronghold and an urban environment, I thought we might run into some voter intimidation, but fortunately, that's not the case.”\n\nChilds said the most common questions come with address verification documents, but other than that, things have been smooth, and at times, triumphant.\n\n“I thought it was my civic duty, not only to vote but help others vote as well. And that came true today when I was able to help this elderly lady across the gym to vote. She was so determined because she had lost her absentee ballot and she really wanted to vote. (That was) definitely the highlight of my day,” she said, smiling.\n\nVanessa Carney, who voted at the New Beginnings Are Possible site, said she came out on Election Day because, “I wanted to make sure my ballot actually got in.”\n\nGregory Julien, 52, said he came out to vote because he doesn’t trust the mail in ballots, but he does trust the machines.\n\nHe said he voted for Biden because Biden was Obama’s vice President and, “If Obama trusts him, I’ll trust him.\"\n\nHe also said that he doesn’t like how Trump handled coronavirus. “With the pandemic, he didn’t warn the United States and because of that, it took a lot of people’s lives.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n2:40 p.m.: Souls to the Polls caravans through Milwaukee, urging residents to vote\n\nVolunteers with the get-out-the-vote initiative Souls to the Polls caravanned through Milwaukee’s north-side neighborhoods Tuesday urging residents to cast their ballots for president.\n\nAbout two dozen people began assembling at Midtown Shopping Center this afternoon before heading west on West Capitol Drive toward the Westlawn and Northlawn housing projects. Though Souls to the Polls bills itself as nonpartisan, the turnout appeared to be largely, if not entirely, Biden supporters.\n\n\"People need to know that they need to vote. This is a critical, critical, critical election,” said Rev. Mose Fuller of St. Timothy Community Baptist Church in Milwaukee and first vice president of Souls to the Polls.\n\n“A lot of people, including myself, we don’t like the way our country has been moving in the last four years. … The very future of our country is at stake.\"\n\nTim Cordon, a social justice coordinator with the First Unitarian Society of Madison, stood outside the lead bus, waving a rainbow flag in one hand and a large inflated balloon of the Earth in the other.\n\n“The people are rising,” Cordon said. “They’re voting in record numbers to make sure we build a world that’s more just, more peaceful, more sustainable and run democratically, not by the rich, power-mongering, greedy corporate elite. …. It’s so exciting to be a part of this moment in history.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n2:20 p.m.: These communities already topped 2016 votes with absentee ballots, but polls were still packed Tuesday\n\nVoters in the town of Hull and the Village Plover packed into their respective municipal halls even as both locales saw record-breaking absentee ballots cast.\n\nThe socially-distant voting line at the town of Hull, for instance, stretched out of the township’s municipal hall and well on to Wojcik Memorial Drive for the first two and a half hours, Hull Chief Inspector Heidi O’Brien said.\n\nO’Brien called the volume of absentee ballots and the number of in-person voters stunning, saying she hasn’t seen anything like it in her 12 years working election day. She estimates voter turnout could hit 70% in the town. More than 2,000 people cast ballots absentee this year, far outpacing past presidential years that were about half that number, O’Brien said. Some 5,400 people live in Hull, according to the U.S. Census 2018 estimates.\n\nIn Plover, more than 6,500 people cast votes before Nov. 3, surpassing the 2016 vote total in a village of about 13,000, according to U.S. Census 2018 estimates. At noon, Village Clerk Karen Swanson said the village was processing about 135 voters an hour.\n\nIn Stevens Point, the nearly 8,000 people who voted early meant the city started Election Day with 33% voter turnout. Officials at many of the city’s 11 voting districts said about half of their registered voters cast ballots early.\n\n— Alan Hovorka\n\n2:15 p.m.: 'Hamilton' inspired one first-time voter to cast a ballot\n\nAt about 2 p.m., there were no lines at Longfellow School in Milwaukee, where chief inspector Paul Grippe said that 118 people had voted. Grippe said that he has seen about a dozen observers coming in and out, many more that at any other election. There’s been no scarcity of poll workers. They have seen a lot of new faces applying to be a poll worker.\n\nCarlos Ginard, part of the group Election Protection on behalf of Workers United, was sitting outside with two other members. He said he has been to three poll locations today and hasn’t seen lines or major issues at any of them. Two representatives from Voces de la Frontera were also outside and reported no issues.\n\nFirst-time voter Nicole Lopez, 19, said she watched Hamilton and ever since she has wanted to vote. She says that because of COVID-19, she requested an absentee ballot two to three weeks ago, but never received it, so she came in person today. Lopez says she voted for Biden and doesn’t like Trump: “It’s just a lot of hate that I don’t think should be spread”. She expects the new U.S. president will help immigrants.\n\n— Maria Jesus Perez Sanchez\n\n2:09 p.m.: One voter outlines reasons he's voting for Jo Jorgensen\n\nEddie Lemke, 33, was disappointed by President Donald Trump’s record on gun rights and the war in Iraq.\n\nHe voted Tuesday afternoon for Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian candidate for president, at Doerfler Elementary School in Milwaukee, where the line was short.\n\nThe major issues driving him to vote this election were gun rights, anti-authoritarianism and taxes, he said.\n\nIn 2016, he also voted for third-party candidate Gary Johnson, a Libertarian. He doesn’t trust either major party candidate to address the issues he cares about.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a lot of the same stuff either way,” he said of the major parties.\n\nLemke disapproved of Trump’s calling for red flag laws, in the aftermath of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio last year. He said there has been more war under Trump and disliked that he hadn’t withdrawn more troops from Iraq.\n\nLemke said most people want the election to be over with and said the animosity during the campaign has been unhealthy.\n\n“You’re not voting for something, you’re voting against something,” he said of the candidates’ messages.\n\nAdalberto Cruz, 53, left the polling place at Doerfler shortly after Lemke.\n\nCruz voted for Democrat Joe Biden and wanted Trump out of office.\n\n“The president’s a clown,” he said. “He doesn’t respect people.”\n\nOriginally from Puerto Rico, Cruz criticized Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in 2017.\n\nHe also said the island is taking the coronavirus much more seriously than the mainland.\n\nHe disagreed with Trump’s handling of the virus.\n\n“People are dying and he wants to open a lot of things,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n2:00 p.m.: Updates from Waukesha County\n\nMark Fish said he voted for Donald Trump because of Trump’s support of law enforcement and the Veterans Administration (VA). Fish said his wife works for the VA and said he didn’t believe in defunding the police.\n\n\n\nThis year is the second election that Fish has voted Republican. He had voted for Democratic Party candidates in previous elections before 2016, which is when he first voted for Trump.\n\n\n\n“I felt that the Democratic Party ran a dirty campaign, a very dirty campaign,” Fish said about his decision in 2016 to vote Republican.\n\n\n\nFish said the one thing he wishes Trump would do differently is stay off social media and “quit poking the bear.”\n\n\n\n“All he’s doing is poking the media and making you guys think he’s doing something that he’s truly not,” Fish said.\n\n\n\nKelsey Kottwitz said she voted for Joe Biden because she doesn’t care for Trump as a person.\n\n\n\n“I can’t really support him because of my morals and what I believe in. I’m a teacher as well, so that also affects who I vote for,” Kottwitz said.\n\n\n\nAs a teacher, Kottwitz said that she thought Biden is supportive of teachers and wants to protect them. She said it’s scary for many teachers like her during the COVID-19 pandemic and said she’s lucky to work at a school that’s small enough where social distancing can take place. Kottwitz’ school operates in a hybrid model of learning.\n\n\n\n“That’s why I feel comfortable going in and working on the days that I have to, but many teachers don’t feel that way because their classes are much bigger. I think their feelings are warranted,” Kottwitz said.\n\n\n\nThis year is the second election that Fish has voted Republican.

Inside Schuetze Recreation Center in the city of Waukesha, more than 1,700 voters among the polling site’s 2,100 registered voters had already cast ballots as of 2 p.m., according to poll inspector John Kelling. That, of course, included the roughly 1,000 that voted absentee before Election Day began. “It’s been great,” Kelling said, noting it was busy in the early morning, with brief lines and no problems. “Not as busy as we would have expected, but that was because of all of the absentees.”\n\nIn New Berlin between 10:30 a.m. and 12:10 p.m, the lines at the New Berlin Public Library were short, with voters reporting waits of less than five minutes. Lisa Abbott and her daughter Kaitlyn went together to vote. This year was Kaitlyn’s first time voting, according to Lisa. Lisa said she voted in-person because she never received her absentee ballot in the mail when she tried to vote absentee in the spring. Both Lisa and Kaitlyn said they voted for Donald Trump, and Lisa said she thought Trump would help rebuild the economy. “I don’t trust (Joe) Biden. I think he’s a puppet. I think he’s going to be out in a few months and Kamala’s (Kamala Harris) is going to be president if that’s the way it goes,” Lisa Abbott said.\n\n— Jim Riccioli and Alec Johnson\n\n1:53 p.m.: Germantown officials remind voters to 'keep one cow apart' in line\n\nThe Village of Germantown officials made multiple signs with the words, \"Maintain Social Distancing\" and, in a move that is wholly Wisconsin, \"Keep One Cow Apart\" as a reminder to voters while they waited to cast their ballots.\n\n— Cathy Kozlowicz\n\n1:34 p.m.: First-time voters aplenty\n\nAt the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School in the Harambee neighborhood, the highlight of the morning for chief inspector Bela Roongta was the surprising number of people registering to vote for the first time.\n\nRoongta couldn’t say exactly how many new registrants the polling site hosted after six and a half hours on Tuesday. But she said she was considering adding another table at the site to help speed the process along.\n\n“That’s been really gratifying,” she said. \"That’s been the longest line. It’s fun to see people register.”\n\nShe echoed what officials at other sites had reported early Tuesday: They had a decently busy morning when the polls opened and have enjoyed a quiet, steady stream of voters since then. Staffing has been “great” and there hadn’t been any delays.\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m., about 170 people voted at the school, officials said.\n\n“It was a great experience seeing everyone work together and voting,” said Marquis Shipp, 28, after casting his ballot.\n\nOver at Marshall High School, John and Alexis Cash were first-time voters and the process couldn’t have gone smoother for the couple.\n\nThere were no lines in the early afternoon, and the registration and voting process took just over 30 minutes for the two 23-year-olds\n\n“It went good,” John said. “We had to type in our new address and stuff. People were very welcoming and helped you out.”\n\nThey had not planned on voting, but were swayed after talking with friends. John had the day off from work, making it easier to get to the polls as a family.\n\n“I feel like every vote matters,” Alexis said. “And it’s important to come out and vote.”\n\nThere was also an immediate benefit. While John and Alexis answered questions, the couple’s young son giggled incessantly and played with John’s “I Voted” sticker.\n\n— Elliot Hughes and Ben Steele\n\n1:27 p.m.: Few reports of problems at the polls in Wisconsin\n\nElection Day is proceeding smoothly with few reports of excessive lines or voter intimidation, Wisconsin’s chief election official Meagan Wolfe said at a midday press briefing Tuesday.\n\nWolfe said lines appear to be shorter overall than in past elections, likely due to the large number of people who already voted via absentee ballots. Nor have any polling sites reported a shortage of poll workers, she said.\n\nElections officials have not heard any specific threats against polling sites or large-scale disinformation campaigns, the Wisconsin Elections Commission said. The Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department and the Wisconsin Attorney General’s office all reported no issues.\n\nAbout 200 National Guard service members have been deployed as poll workers and are wearing civilian clothes, Wolfe said.\n\n“None of them are in uniform and none are serving in any law enforcement or crowd control capacity,” she said.\n\nThe ACLU of Wisconsin and other nonprofits watching for voter issues also reported few hiccups.\n\nCommon Ground executive director Jennifer O’Hear said the nonprofit talked to one voter who lost her absentee ballot but was told she could not vote in-person unless she produced the ballot. O’Hear said the group managed to get a lawyer on the phone with the poll worker to allow the woman to vote.\n\n“Fortunately we caught that early this morning, because it could have happened to a number of people,” O’Hear said.\n\nOverall, O’Hear said she was impressed by the persistence of voters this year.\n\n“We’ve seen a number of voters who’ve come and had to go back home and get documentation and they’ve done it,” O’Hear said. “I’m really impressed with people’s persistence.”\n\n— Daphne Chen, Cary Spivak\n\n1:20 p.m.: These statues in Greenfield are dressed for the occasion\n\nThe two lion statues outside of The Starr Group in Greenfield are dressed up in donkey and elephant costumes for Election Day.\n\n\"Any event that we feel is important, we try to dress them up,\" said Mary Starr, who co-owns the insurance agency at 5005 W. Loomis Road with her husband, Tim Starr.\n\nThe lions have been decorated for just about any and every occasion since the early ‘80s. The agency’s longtime client, Darlene Mattmiller, has made all of the lions' costumes and dressed them up, with help from her son, Dave Mattmiller.\n\nRead the full story from Hannah Kirby.\n\n1:15 p.m.: One voter said early-morning long lines in South Milwaukee not too much hassle\n\nSouth Milwaukee resident Robyn Polak found herself in a long line a little before 8 a.m. at Divine Mercy Parish, 800 Marquette Ave., Nov. 3. She was voter 121 on election day.\n\n“The lines actually moved fast, only three main votes on the ballot, others were for local positions,” Polak said. “I was in and out within 25 minutes. I think the wait was worth it, met some great people, too.”\n\n— Erik Hanley\n\n1:10 p.m.: One inspector relieved to see 'nightmares' of Election Day unfounded\n\nAt the Green Tree Preparatory School poll, chief inspector Terre Welbes, 72, didn’t know what to expect on Election Day.\n\n“I was dreaming it. I had nightmares,” she said.\n\nBut when the day came, Welbes had no conflicts or instances of voter intimidation. She was glad to see the election coming to an end.\n\n“I’ll sleep really well tonight,” said the retired teacher.\n\n— Mark Johnson\n\n1:08 p.m.: Voter said she wanted to make sure her vote 'wasn't lost'\n\nRuthie Sparks, a 57-year-old Milwaukee resident, said she chose to come to the polls on Election Day because she wanted to make sure her “vote wasn’t lost.”\n\n“I wanted to see how many people would come,” she said, adding that most were still at work. When asked who she voted for, she said, “It wasn’t Trump. I don’t like Trump; he ain’t right. He’s the reason all this mess is going on.”\n\nIf Trump wins, Sparks said she thinks things will “be even worse than (they are) now.” More people, she said, need to come out here and vote.\n\nJoy Hudson, the chief elections Inspector for the Thurston Woods Elementary School voting location says that everything has gone well so far.\n\n\"Nobody has wanted us to answer any questions,\" she said. \"They just went to get in and vote.\"\n\nRoughly 190 people have come through the doors and Hudson said even though there has been a morning rush and a steady trickle of voters since then, she thinks a lot of people voted early.\n\nBrandi Byas, a 25-year-old voter at the Thurston Woods location, said she voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe said she was a little bit worried about mail-in voting, which is why she came in person for this election.\n\n\"I don't know about that mail; I had a package addressed to me that got delivered to the wrong house, I don't trust them,\" she said laughing.\n\nShe also said that she voted for Biden, adding that it would take a paragraph to explain why she's not voting for Trump. \"I don't believe in his views,\" she said. \"Let's leave it at that.\"\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n1:04 p.m.: ACLU doesn't believe long lines are indication of polling-place problems\n\nWhen longer lines have been seen at Wisconsin polling places Tuesday, it's been the result of significant voter turnout and social distancing measures — not because there are problems with election administration, said Molly Collins, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin.\n\n\"Things seem to be running pretty smoothly,\" Collins said mid-day Tuesday.\n\nThe ACLU of Wisconsin has election observers throughout the state and is responding to Wisconsin calls made to the national nonpartisan Election Protection hotline 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).\n\nACLU election observers also have noted an increased police presence at polling locations in some cities around the state, but not in Milwaukee.\n\n\"I'm concerned about police presence in polling places and potentially disenfranchising folks who may be uncomfortable around police,\" Collins said.\n\n— Ashley Luthern\n\n12:56 p.m.: Craig Gilbert breaks down the Wisconsin race\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel Craig Gilbert, the Washington bureau chief, breaks down what he's looking for as results begin to pour in from Wisconsin's election.\n\n12:41 p.m.: Green Bay police chief allays concerns over online ballot-counting rumor\n\nIn Green Bay, city officials reported a minor delay in voting at one site because a ballot machine was slow to start, one incident of someone illegally electioneering and concerns about an online rumor related to the city’s ballot counting.\n\nOne machine at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay poll location was not ready on time at 7 a.m., Mayor Eric Genrich said during a midday press conference.\n\n“But there was no malfunctioning or any problems with the equipment. It was just kind of a matter of the machine being a little slow to wake up,” Genrich said.\n\nGreen Bay Chief of Police Andrew Smith warned against misinformation circulating online that ballot counting was suddenly and mysteriously moved from City Hall to the KI Convention Center. Smith clarified that it was planned several weeks ago. The “Central Count” location in Green Bay is among 39 set up statewide.\n\nSmith noted election observers from both parties are at Green Bay’s Central Count site, and he said there was a minor incident of someone campaigning too close to a polling site in the city.\n\n“One of our officers went by there, asked them to move 100 feet away and they cooperated and that was the end of that,” he said.\n\nThe chief said there were some pre-scheduled rallies and some people are going around the city in caravans trying to get out the vote.\n\n“I don’t consider any of that protests; I consider them rallies and that’s fine,” Smith said. “We welcome people to do things of that nature of course.”\n\nSmith said the police are monitoring what’s going on across the country, social media, and in Green Bay in regard to protests Tuesday night. Police usually find out protests in advance and help coordinate and facilitate those events, he said.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\n12:35 p.m.: Roughly 200 voters at Milwaukee Safety Academy before noon\n\nBelinda Bradley, chief elections inspector for the Milwaukee Safety Academy, said the location was crowded when doors first opened. “The lines were long, they were outside the door and into the parking lot.”\n\nThings eased up at 10, she said, and gave a rough estimate of about 200 voters that had come through.\n\nShe said there were quite a few new voters and voter registrations and most people were asking if they were in the right ward. The location serves as the polling place for both wards 18 and 19.\n\nThere weren’t enough poll workers in the beginning, Bradley said, but the commission quickly sent more. Observers, on the other hand, have dwindled from five in the beginning down to two.\n\nBradley said even though she knows things are slow right now, she’s expecting an after-work surge.\n\n“I know we’re going to get that rush at around 1, 3 and 5 (o’clock), because that’s when people start getting off work,” she said.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n12:00 p.m.: Yes, Wisconsin does in fact have same-day registration\n\nA tweet this morning from the ACLU that's been retweeted more than 30,000 times lists the states in which voters can register at the polls on Election Day.\n\nBut they left off Wisconsin, among a litany of other errors.\n\nTo be clear: Voters who aren’t registered can do that at the polls today and vote immediately in Wisconsin. Just don’t forget your photo ID and proof of residence.\n\nOther states left off the ACLU list that do allow same-day registration are Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Rhode Island and Utah, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and Ballotpedia. Rhode Island voters registering on Election Day can only vote in the presidential race.\n\nUpdate: The ACLU corrected the error and acknowledged earlier omissions, though the initial tweet had been re-tweeted 30,000 times by then.\n\n— Eric Litke\n\n11:53 p.m.: No lines at all in Brookfield\n\nNo lines, inside or outside, were seen at Brookfield East or Brookfield Central High Schools at 11 a.m. Tuesday morning.\n\nMany voters at both locations said it took them less than five minutes to vote.\n\nEmily, a 37-year-old Brookfield resident, said she voted for President Donald Trump Tuesday. She said she voted in-person because “this is the day we vote.”\n\nShe said she’s voting “to support freedom.”\n\n“I believe Trump wants to keep our country free, and Biden wants to shut our country down,” she said.\n\n“It has less to do with the person and more to do with the policies. I wouldn’t say he’s my favorite person in the world,” she added.\n\nJacob Rosenthal also said he also voted for Trump in 2016. He did the same this year.\n\n“I had a really big problem with Biden’s pro-choice issue,” he said.\n\nHe didn’t vote before election day because he’s worried about possible fraud.\n\n“I just had a really big problem with the whole mail-in ballot thing,” he said.\n\nAlexia Miles, a poll worker at Brookfield East High School said the “vast majority” of voters were wearing masks.\n\nThis is her first time working the polls.\n\n“One thing with the coronavirus, a lot of poll workers are elderly, and there might be a shortage, so I wanted to do what I could to help,” she said.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n11:30 a.m.: Glendale swiftly recovers after election official contracts COVID\n\nGlendale’s city clerk was diagnosed with the coronavirus last week, said Mayor Bryan Kennedy in an email, but the deputy clerk and other workers are still handling the election.\n\n“We had two workers that worked closely with her stay home in quarantine,” Kennedy said in an email. “They wore a mask any time they were out of their offices in city hall. Those two tested negative two times over the course of five days. They are back at work and assisting with the election from their offices at city hall.”\n\nKennedy said the deputy clerk is handling the election with help from the city administrator. The deputy clerk has called the city clerk for advice throughout the day, he said.\n\n“We have chief election inspectors at our three locations and poll workers dealing directly with the public,” said Kennedy.\n\nHe said just over 75% of registered voters have voted early.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n11:21 a,m,: Turnout slower than usual at Gordon Park, but plenty of food\n\nTurnout has been slower than usual today for a presidential election at the Gordon Park polling site, potentially due to early voting, said election official Yves Lapierre, who has been working elections for 16 years.\n\nBut there has been more free food than other years, he said.\n\nJames Sauer of Company Brewing had a table stacked high with ham and turkey sandwiches to give away as part of World Central Kitchen’s #chefstothepolls initiative.\n\nThere were also plenty of poll workers on hand, with 35 people signed up to help throughout the day, Lapierre said.\n\nAdditionally, a Republican from Wisconsin and two Democrats from Wisconsin and Illinois were signed in as observers. Lapierre said he has had out-of-state observers before and the number wasn’t unusual.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\n11:16 a.m.: West Allis has some of the area's longest lines\n\nIn West Allis, lines snaked around the outside of City Hall; at Central High School, they stretched far down the street. In both places, the wait times at mid-morning were averaging around an hour, according to voters and election officials.\n\nBoth polling places were serving voters from six wards, the most of the city's five locations.\n\n\"So far, so good. It's been pretty smooth,\" said West Allis Election Services Specialist Gina Gresch.\n\nGresch said the early part of her day was spent fielding questions about hospitalized voters.\n\n\"COVID voters, because they're quarantined, we have to treat them as hospitalized voters, and there's an extra process to that,\" she said.\n\nOther questions have dealt with where people can go to vote and what they need to vote, she said.\n\nIn terms of turnout, Gresch said absentee ballots alone accounted for nearly 54% of registered voters.\n\n— Bob Dohr\n\n11:00 a.m.: World Central Kitchen handing out food in Riverwest\n\nNobody was stuck in line to vote at the Fratney School in Riverwest late Tuesday morning, but volunteers with World Central Kitchen were there to hand out food anyway.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen is an organization created in 2010 primarily to distribute food to those impacted by natural disasters all over the globe.\n\nThe food stand was manned by Liz Hagedorn, the general manager for Club Charlie’s, which provided the parfaits and chicken salad sandwiches.\n\nShe said she and her crew were bouncing from polling site to polling site Tuesday “just to feed people while waiting to vote, do something good. It’s nonpartisan.”\n\nWater and transportation were provided by J.L. Bloom’s Landscapes.\n\n— Elliot Hughes\n\n10:57 a.m.: First-time voter cites pandemic as driving factor in her choice\n\nAt 10:30 a.m., 18-year-old Adriana Merkel cast her very first vote at the Milwaukee Sign Language School. The pandemic was a major factor.\n\n“Biden is more concerned. He’s wearing the mask. Trump thinks it’s a joke. Biden takes it seriously. I feel like everybody should vote, especially this election with Trump in office. We’ve got to get him out.”\n\nShe walked out of the poll with Jason Swiderski, a 40-year-old electrical worker.\n\n“I voted for Biden because he doesn’t lie and I think he’ll have a better control of the virus,\" Swiderski said.\n\n— Mark Johnson\n\n10:50 a.m.: Musicians bringing their craft to polling places\n\nCarrie and Brian Kulas stood outside of the polling place at Lincoln Park for District 8 in Manitowoc, playing the violin and the string bass, respectively, for two hours Tuesday morning. The pair usually plays for the Manitowoc Symphony Orchestra, but today they were playing for Play for the Vote, a national, nonpartisan organization that arranged for musical performances at polling places throughout the country.\n\n“It’s a pretty anxious time and you get tired of sitting around on your hands waiting for someone else to make something happen,” Brian Kulas said. “Music is all about togetherness. It’s really a universal language. It doesn’t matter what side you’re on, everybody loves music.”\n\n— Alisa Schafer\n\n10:48 a.m.: Disappointment with both candidates not deterring voters\n\nP", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/joe-biden-first-year-in-office/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden enters the second year of his presidency looking for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs he walked through the front gate of the White House complex last year for the first time as President, Joe Biden declared it felt like “going home.”\n\nIf the presidency seemed then like a natural fit for a 50-year creature of Washington, today its limits are leading to a reckoning over expectations and ambitions in a country as exhausted, angry and divided as ever.\n\nBiden enters the second year of his term with one of the lowest approval ratings of a modern-day president, depleted of the political capital and sense of confidence that followed him into office.\n\nA sense of normalcy returned to the White House following the whiplash of Donald Trump’s presidency, but a string of setbacks – at home and abroad – have eroded the air of competence that once surrounded a President and his team, who have spent most of their lives in government and campaigned for the job on a pledge of restoring order.\n\nOn most days since January 20, 2021, the President has arrived at the Oval Office early in the morning, peppered his team with detailed questions and tried not to think too much about the man who’d just vacated the building, leaving behind a pandemic, angry divisions and – inside a drawer of the Resolute Desk – a lengthy letter for Biden. The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family’s furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nThe 12 months Biden has been in office did come with major victories. He successfully guided passage of trillions in new funding to combat the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild American’s crumbling infrastructure through Congress. He has appointed more federal judges than his recent predecessors, overseen a boom in hiring, a drop in poverty and orchestrated a nationwide vaccination campaign.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A “malaise” has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve – while his own son watched on.\n\n“There are successes that he’s had, but people do not feel it and you can’t persuade people to feel better. You can’t jawbone that,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama’s White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to “end this uncivil war” remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden’s trademark personal style – wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office – hasn’t brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nRELATED: Battered White House searches for a Biden comeback scenario\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring “independence from the virus” on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid’s permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n“Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden’s election,” said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. “He was not elected to transform the country.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\n“They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,” one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden’s first year is ending with a focus on what he didn’t accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n“Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.”\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n“There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They’re in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We’re not doing good enough,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n“The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They’re worthless,” Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as “an incredibly difficult circumstance.”\n\n“You don’t get everything done in the first year,” Psaki said. “The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.”\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden – the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n“This virus has fooled us multiple times,” one senior health official told CNN. “Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it’s a big, big surprise.”\n\nRELATED: Biden vowed to fix testing. But he didn’t plan for Omicron.\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, “you should keep your head down and keep working.”\n\n“He’s not panicking. He’s not blaming anyone,” the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President’s approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBiden’s poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he’d once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker’s day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n“You know what it takes to go meet with the President?” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. “It’s just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You’ve got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.”\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year’s midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset – on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden – whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week – is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden’s speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation’s oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,” she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024. And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris – whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues – have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won’t.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden’s sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It’s a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn’t understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden’s achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n“I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,” said Susan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. “We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.”\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden’s first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected – despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off – even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would “pop up a little bit and then go back down,” he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend – one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he’d thought of ordering millions more tests earlier – even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden’s promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his “wit’s end.”\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn’t executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most – chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti – have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n“If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I’d have a new chief of staff,” one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn’t accustomed to – and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend’s house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander, arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called “The Bulletin.” He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President’s preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden’s quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere’s little question that the outcome of his second year – and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have – will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/12/31/arizona-long-term-care-facilities-and-covid-19-how-crisis-grew/3906755001/", "title": "Arizona protected nursing homes from liability, but did little to protect ...", "text": "Mark Miguel Jr. had lived at a Tucson nursing home since 2016, when a head injury left him unable to walk and impaired his speech.\n\nHis sisters, Priscilla and Drucilla, visited him regularly at Sapphire of Tucson Nursing and Rehabilitation, and in February shared a laugh when their 29-year-old brother asked for a cigarette.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/31"}]}

They've made action figures and fuzzy plush toys in my likeness, for goodness sakes. … So I guess that's more of a closet monster thing.\n\nAll the glamour and recognition is cool. But to tell you the truth, sometimes I get bored. Not this weekend, though! NASCAR weekends at the speedway are the best!\n\nI'm a party animal at heart, albeit somewhat of a wallflower. I typically don't say much, but I can hang. I'm the first one here every morning, in the FanZone just outside Turn 4 at Dover International Speedway, and the last to leave each night. … OK. Fine. I never leave. I'm here all the time. Have been since 2008. That makes me 6 years old.\n\nI weigh 20 tons and I'm 92 feet tall. But you can only see my top half, or 46 feet, since I'm bursting out of the ground. I heard something about that being five stories, but that has to be wrong. I have countless stories. My hobbies include race cars, wreckin' race cars and rockin' out at Firefly.\n\nOh, and people watching.\n\nThis concrete speedway behind me – they call it the Monster Mile (great name) – seats more than 100,000 fans. And my bright red eyes see everything: the Monster Energy (great name) stunt bike riders, the face painting, the moon bounce, the traffic on Route 1.\n\nAnd you.\n\nI see Kevin and Cindi Socie, who have been here five or six times.\n\nThey bring Coney dogs from their home near Syracuse, New York, and camp out with a group of about 10 friends, who travel from all over and bring regional foods of their own.\n\nI see Louis Teodoro, way in the back of that RV lot, by the fire pit, between those two campers, hanging out with his group of seven friends from Long Island, New York. There used to be eight of them.\n\n\"But we had to get rid of one!\" someone shouts. \"One couldn't help himself. He didn't know how to use a toilet.\"\n\nThese guys have been here every year for four years in a row. One of them, Jim Spano, scored an autograph from Dale Earnhardt Sr. about a week before \"The Intimidator\" passed away. He gave it to his friend, Tom McNevin, who named his son Dale. They're flying a No. 3 flag high above one of their campers.\n\nI see Melissa Tervay grilling lunch for her husband, James, and their two young sons, not far from that giant, mud-caked, cherry red Ford F350.\n\nIs that thing even street legal? Man, I'd love to crush it.\n\nThe Tervays came from Albany, New York, in a camper they just bought off a friend. Their boys, ages 10 and 7, went to their very first NASCAR race here last year. Then they went to Pocono. And now they're back! James has been bringing the same cooler to races for 20 years.\n\n\"It's got 1995 stickers on it,\" he boasts.\n\nJames seems unsure if \"Melissa\" has more than one \"l\" in her name.\n\n\"Seriously!?\" she fumes.\n\nHe winks.\n\n\"Just testing her.\"\n\nI see dogs riding in the bed of pickups. I see people riding bikes through the mud. And I see fans running around, using race flags as capes.\n\nI also see Richard Miller's sweet checkered flag pants.\n\nHe and his friend, Pete Spahle, have been to most Dover races since 1998, and always sit in the same seats. They came down from West Orange, New Jersey, on Thursday afternoon, and set up a tent in the midst of that nasty rainstorm.\n\n\"We love it,\" Spahle said. \"We had nothing else to do.\"\n\nI see that row of dancing solar powered toys through the windshield of an RV, and an ESPN film crew shooting video of it for possible use in the opening sequence of next week's broadcast.\n\nI see Glenn Barlow lounging in the shade nearby, after wolfing down the Mountain Man breakfast he cooked in that Dutch oven. Barlow and his wife, a retired school teacher, come here twice a year from their home in Rehoboth Beach and meet up with a large group of friends. There are five couples, this time.\n\nThe Barlows have spent a night in their camper in 45 different states, including Alaska, but they sure love Delaware. Last spring, they brought their oldest grandson, who is 8, to the race.\n\n\"He loved the Monster,\" Barlow said. \"And his birthday was like a week later, so I had to sneak over there and get him a replica of it. It was just great. He just loved that.\"\n\nSo much for being a stereotypical monster.\n\nI might not be too scary, but at least I command respect. At 11:45 Sunday morning, NASCAR legend Richard Petty and I will host a free Q&A.\n\nThe track even gives race winners a trophy shaped like me! Isn't that cool?\n\nMachiavelli had it backward. It's better to be loved than feared.\n\nContact Jason Wolf at jwolf@delawareonline.com.

The club started the parade 118 years ago.\n\nRichard Lippincott, the oldest serving past commodore expected to attend, will help lead the parade Saturday in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by convertibles carrying other commodores in what locals will say is the biggest town celebration of the year.\n\n“I never thought I would be in a position like that leading the parade,” said the 71-year-old Lippincott of Maryland, who is more used to sailing.\n\n“Our parade is very colorful and it has everything — youth and other marching groups, sporting teams, floats, antique cars, bicycles, bands and fire departments from all over.”\n\nEach year the parade committee chooses a grand marshal who has made a significant contribution to the borough.\n\n“Since the yacht club is celebrating its 150th anniversary season, there was no better choice to lead this year’s parade,” said Tracy Hansen Foedisch, chairperson of the Riverton Fourth of July Committee.\n\nThe first July 4th parade was called the Children’s Parade. It began at one end of Main Street and ended at the yacht club at the other end.\n\nRevelers dressed in Sunday best for the parade and the events that followed — political and patriotic speeches, yacht racing, band concerts, swimming events and fireworks.\n\nThe parade now starts at the yacht club and ends at Memorial Park, where there are old-fashioned games, a greased pole climbing contest, pony and camel rides and a costumed pet pageant.\n\n“It’s small-town America, a little town that has stayed frozen in time,” said Nick Mortgu, club chairman of 150th anniversary events and a past commodore. “Many return to Riverton for the parade and townspeople appreciate the time that goes into our July 4 events and flock to the parade route, where many homeowners along it invite guests to open houses.”\n\n“We get 150 people at our house for the parade,” he added.\n\nEach year children in the parade receive a U.S. flag, but this year they will receive the yacht club burgee, with red and white stripes and blue stars reminiscent of the American flag. All runners who sign up for the 5K run and the mile walk before the parade will receive a T-shirt.\n\nAll of the yacht club’s 23 living former commodores were invited to collectively serve as grand marshal with current Commodore Mary Keppel.\n\n“This yacht club is more than a collection of sailing enthusiasts who maintain a quaint looking building and very serviceable pier for their own purposes. It has a place in sailing history,” Mortgu said.\n\nLong a community fixture, the club also has contributed to the global sailing community, producing more than 100 national and international champions, including John MacCausland and generations of the Lippincott family. The club boasts an Olympic medalist, a TransAtlantic Race winner and two America’s Cup holders.\n\nThe yacht club is the oldest club of its type on the Delaware River, the oldest in New Jersey and one of the oldest in the U.S. in continuous service.\n\nPhiladelphia businessmen like the Biddles and Whartons founded the club after founding Riverton in 1851 as a summer retreat to escape the city. It housed a waiting room on the second floor to accommodate ferries that plied the river before bridges were built.\n\nThe club offers public sailing courses for children and adults in the summer and has an open invitation for the public to visit the pier and watch weekly races that attract participants from up and down the Atlantic seaboard.\n\n“It’s very extraordinary to be celebrating in a club with such a history, a history we don’t always think about. You also feel like a big part of the community and that’s a reward,” said 56-year-old Keppel, only the second female commodore in club history.\n\nShe said she would like to see more female leaders because the 200-member club has about the same number of men and women.\n\n“I think many of us are moms and we’re busy, but that may not be the total answer. By encouraging others, I hope there will be more,” she said.\n\nReach Carol Comegno at (856) 486-2473 or ccomegno@gannettnj.com\n\nTHE GRAND MARSHALS\n\nCommodores expected for the Riverton Fourth of July Parade:\n\nRichard Lippincott; David Styer; Nick Mortgul; Ray Szculczewski; Terry Rapp; Ron Bower; Glenn Smyth; Hank Croft; Allen Crew; Terry Fennell; Craig Greenwood; Barb Smyth; Keith Wenig; Bob Corney; John Mangan; Harry Mayer; and Mary Keppel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/14/pa-grand-jury-report-catholic-clergy-sexual-abuse-names-details-catholic-dioceses/948937002/", "title": "Pa. priest abuse: List of 301 names, with details, from grand jury", "text": "On Aug. 14, Pennsylvania released a statewide grand jury report on what the state attorney general's office called an \"honest and comprehensive accounting of widespread sexual abuse by more than 300 priests.\"\n\nThe report, more than 800 pages long, lists the name of 301 priests and provides details into specific accusations.

Records received from the Diocese indicate that, as early as 1984, the Diocese was aware of inappropriate sexual conduct by Galko.\n\nGalko admitted to the Diocesan Chancellor in 1984 to having sexual contact with a male parishioner who was eighteen at the time. Galko also admitted that, while at St. Ambrose in Schuylkill Haven, Schuylkill County, he inappropriately touched a male while they were in the rectory. Galko performed oral sex on the male and had the male perform oral sex on him. Galko further admitted to \"occasional occurrences\" over a span of many years.\n\nEdward George Ganster\n\nWhere he served:\n\n4/13/1971 - 8/19/1975: Assistant Pastor, Notre Dame, Bethlehem, PA\n\n4/13/1971 - 2/4/1972: Associate Professor, Bethlehem Catholic High School, PA\n\n7/9/1973 - 10/10/1978: Regional Director, C.Y. 0., Bethlehem District\n\n8/19/1975 - 9/9/1976: Assistant, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Bethlehem, PA\n\n9/9/1976 - 10/10/1978: St. Joseph, Easton, PA\n\n10/10/1978 - 6/15/1981: Assistant, St. Ignatius Loyola, Sinking Spring, PA\n\n10/10/1978 - 6/15/1981: American Catholic Overseas Aid Fund\n\n6/15/1981 - 5/4/1982: Pastor, St. Joseph, Frackville, PA\n\n9/18/1981 - 4/2919/1986: Catholic Daughters of the Americas Court St. James\n\n10/08/1981 - 2/1/1982: Sick Leave\n\n2/1/1982 - 5/4/1982: Returned as Pastor, St. Joseph, Frackville, PA\n\n5/4/1982 - 9/7/1982: Sick Leave\n\n9/7/1982 - 1/18/1983: Assistant, St. Ambrose, Schuylkill Haven, PA\n\n10/01/1982 - 7/25/1983: Catholic Student Advisor, Penn State University Campus Ministry\n\n1/18/1983 - 4/29/1986: Pastor, SS.

Gillespie. The victim reported that, while he was an altar boy at about the age of ten at St. Joseph's in Girardville, Gillespie began grooming him for future abuse.\n\nThe victim reported that he stayed the night at Gillespie's residence on several occasions. The victim reported that Gillespie would drink alcohol during the sleepovers. The victim recalled an occasion when Gillespie gave him cold medication and in addition had him drink alcohol. The victim described this night as a \"blackout\" and \"confusing.\" The victim recalls waking up naked in bed with Gillespie who had his arm around the victim. In three separate documents regarding the victim, all provided by the Diocese, the victim reported that Gillespie performed oral sex on him.\n\nEdward R. Graff\n\nWhere he served:\n\n06/1955 - 04/1957: Annunciation B.V.M., Shenandoah\n\n04/1957 - 05/1958: St. Anthony of Padua, Easton\n\n05/1958 - 09/1958: St. Elizabeth's, Pen Argyl\n\n09/1958 - 09/1959: Pius X High School, Roseto\n\n09/1959 - 06/1962: Residence, St. Anthony, Easton\n\n06/1962 - 09/1963: University of Notre Dame\n\n09/1963 - 03/1964: Our Lady Help of Christians, Allentown\n\n03/1964 - 07/1964: St. Elizabeth, Pen Argyl\n\n07/1964 - 02/1965: Pius X High School, Roseto\n\n02/1965 - 11/1966: Holy Rosary, Reading;\n\nCentral Catholic High School, Reading\n\n11/1966- 08/1968: Holy Name High School, Reading\n\n08/1968- 10/1969: St. Margaret, Reading\n\n10/1969- 04/1971: St Peter, Coplay\n\n04/1971- 04/1974: Annunciation B.V.M., Catasauqua\n\n04/1974 - 11/1979: Director, Thanksgiving Clothing Drive\n\n11/1979 - 07/1980: Sick Leave\n\n07/1980 - 06/1983: St. Margaret, Reading\n\n06/1983 - 02/1992: Holy Guardian Angels, Reading\n\n02/1992: Departed Diocese of Allentown\n\n1992 - 2002: Served in various capacities in Dioceses in New Mexico and Texas\n\nSummary: During his years in ministry, Graff raped scores of children. The grand jury investigated not only Graff's conduct but the knowledge of the relevant Dioceses. The case of Graff is an example of dioceses that minimized the criminal conduct of one of their priests, while secretly noting the significant danger the priest posed to the public.\n\nThe grand jury notes that the use of euphemisms was constant throughout the Dioceses of Pennsylvania, but particularly apparent in the case of Graff. Terms such as \"sick leave\" or \"health leave\" were often used to reference an absence from ministry related to child sexual abuse.\n\nRichard J.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville. Upon his release on November 31, 2005,\n\nYarrosh registered with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender. Upon his release from prison, Yarrosh was still a priest. On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police.

Father John Fischer testified that he walked in on Barletta and a young high school student in private chambers, and that the student was naked from the waist down, trying to pull up his underwear and pants as Barletta watched. Fischer recalled that Monsignor Hastings dismissed the report, and that fellow priests laughed it off.\n\nLater on, Bishop Trautman recorded details of a conversation that he had with Sister Donna Markham about Barletta. Trautman wrote that Barletta abused 5 children. Barletta was confronted with allegations of oral sex, naked messages, digital anal penetration and masturbation against a victim in 1994. When confronted, Barletta admitted his guilt to Trautman. The diocese paid for the victim’s counseling, but once the victim shared the story of abuse with a newspaper, Trautman advised that the victim should seek payment directly from Barletta.\n\nFrom 1975 though 1994 when he was dismissed from Erie Cathedral Prep, Barletta admitted abusing 25 children and young men.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D.

He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Obviously there will be some race rust, considering this is his first Cup start Nov. 8, 2020, and he has admitted as much.\n\nAll of that considered, throw down a tenner on Johnson anyway. No questions asked. For what it's worth, Johnson turned in the fastest lap at Friday's practice session at 194.225 mph.\n\nJustin Haley\n\nOdds: 40-to-1 (+4000)\n\nBuzz: Another former winner at Daytona, albeit in a rain-shortened summer race in 2019, Haley has carved out a niche at superspeedways. He's finished inside the top-15 in four of his previous five starts at Daytona and Talladega, and he tallied an Xfinity Series triumph at Daytona in 2021 for good measure.\n\nHaley made significant strides in his second year as a full-time Cup Series driver, logging three top-fives, leading 44 laps and recording an average finish of 18.4 — 10 spots better than his rookie campaign.\n\nTy Gibbs\n\nOdds: 50-to-1 (+5000)\n\nBuzz: Welcome to the show, rookie! Joe Gibbs' 20-year-old grandson won the Xfinity Series championship in 2022 and jumps into the big leagues to team with Denny Hamlin, Martin Truex Jr. and Christopher Bell.\n\nThis will be Gibbs' first taste of the Daytona 500, but he gained plenty of Cup Series experience in Kurt Busch's absence last year. He ran 15 races for 23XI Racing, including a top-10 showing at Michigan and a 13th-place effort at Daytona in the Coke Zero Sugar 400.\n\nHarrison Burton\n\nOdds: 50-to-1 (+5000)\n\nBuzz: Of this quintet, Burton — driving the iconic No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford — has performed best this week.\n\nBurton cracked the top-12 in single-car qualifying Wednesday, then placed ninth in Duel 1. He'll start 19th, the same spot in which he finished at Daytona last summer.\n\nTy Dillon\n\nOdds: 150-to-1 (+15000)\n\nBuzz: Digging a bit deeper down the list, the younger Dillon brother is tied for the fifth-longest odds in the field. He might just be the best bang-for-the-buck gamble.\n\nDillon has five career top-10s at superspeedways — including a stretch of three Daytona races in a row between 2018-19. He's also crashed out of the race five times; such is the nature of the beast.\n\nDale Earnhardt, driving for Dillon's grandfather Richard Childress, won this race 25 years ago. Austin Dillon, Ty's brother, snatched the Harley J. Earl Trophy five years ago.

Is it too early for bone-rattling cardio beats or a “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” singalong? Objectively, yes. But the tens of thousands of runners huddled in the parking lot of Disney’s Epcot Park have been awake for hours, fluffing their tutus and stretching their hamstrings in preparation for the 13.1-mile journey ahead. The Disney Princess Half Marathon isn’t just a race, after all. It’s an event, and it’s one of dozens of races organized by runDisney every year, attracting racers and Disney enthusiasts from all over the globe.\n\nDisney and running: It’s a powerful combination of obsessions. Among the sparkly throngs packed into the Princess Half Marathon starting corrals are runners who have been pounding the pavement at Disney parks for years, even decades, racking up rows of medals and forging a life-changing passion.\n\nThere’s a whole Disney lingo for these enthusiasts: Goofys. Dopeys. Princesses. Let’s call them the Disney “super runners.” And when it comes to your typical race crowd, they may be the happiest people you’ll ever meet.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the start of the 2022 Princess Half Marathon, a ripple of excitement goes through the crowd – or maybe it’s anxiety. When the starting fireworks go off, the morning will fly by in a blur of color and music and sweat. There are castles to run through, in between several very unmagical highway off-ramps. There are Disney characters to visit, personal bests to chase and finisher medals big enough to eat a meal off of. This is the intoxicating feeling that keeps Disney super runners coming back time after time.\n\nRunDisney races attract about 163,000 participants annually to Disney properties. Each “race” is really a themed weekend of races, ranging from untimed, family-friendly 5Ks to serious 26.2-mile marathons. The tradition began with a single Walt Disney World Marathon in 1994 and ballooned to a whole network of races and challenges across the world.\n\nMerry after completing the Goofy Challenge at the Walt Disney World Marathon weekend (which requires completing the half and full marathon). Courtesy Vicki Sue Merry\n\nVicki Sue Merry has done them all. Well, close enough. At 64 years old, the retired Navy veteran from Cantonment, Florida has run a total of 153 Disney races since 1999. She knows the exact number because she tracks them in an Excel spreadsheet and records them on a special shirt. On it, there are icons from every single event; some for the Castaway Cay 5K on Disney’s private island in the Bahamas, and more for triathlon events and West Coast races in Disneyland that have since been discontinued.\n\nWhen asked about the most unique Disney race she’s completed, Merry doesn’t disappoint.\n\n“They used to have an inline skating half marathon in Disney World, and I got to do it on my 50th birthday.”\n\nLike many serious Disney runners, Merry also runs other races – 663 and counting, to be exact.\n\nBut Disney races are special.\n\n“No matter how big they’ve gotten over the years, and the races have grown and grown, I still feel like Disney cares about individual runners,” she says.\n\nMerry at the 2007 Inline Skate Half Marathon, during which she managed not to fall. From Disney World Sports\n\nThe most popular runDisney race series have a “challenge” aspect that runners like Merry find a bit addictive: You run a few back-to-back races over a weekend, or complete certain races together, and you get special medals and extremely niche bragging rights.\n\nMerry, for instance, is a Perfect Dopey. Those words mean nothing to the general public, but in front of the right audience, they earn gasps of delight. To complete the Dopey Challenge, you have to run all four races during the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend in January. That’s a 5K, a 10K, a half marathon and a marathon over four days – 48.6 miles in total. Merry has done it eight years in a row.\n\nVicki Sue Merry's Disney running shirt in 2019, with every race event recorded on the back. Alexandra Willingham/CNN\n\nFor Mike Flaherty, this year’s Princess Half Marathon marks his 99th Disney race. The event holds a special place in his heart: It was here, in 2014, that his love affair with Disney running began.\n\n“I hadn’t run in ages, and I was getting lazy as I got older,” he says. His wife was preparing to run her second Princess Half Marathon, and convinced him to try out the 5K the same weekend.\n\nIt was love at first mile.\n\nFlaherty and his family after a race at Walt Disney World. Courtesy Mike Flaherty\n\n“I thought it was the coolest thing I’d done as an adult. There was so much energy and positivity from the crowd, so many great stories of people transitioning from not exercising to setting goals for themselves,” he says. “As soon as I got home, I wanted to sign up for more.”\n\nWithin a year, Flaherty went from barely exercising to completing his first half marathon. Then he added the Tower of Terror 10-miler, the inaugural half marathon in Disneyland Paris and the fabled 48.6-mile Dopey Challenge, which he calls the “Super Bowl of runDisney.”\n\nFor Flaherty, it isn’t just the fun medals and the potent Disney atmosphere that gets him excited about his next race. It’s the sense of personal accomplishment, of showing up year after year and completing what once felt like an impossible – nay, Dopey – feat.\n\nA small portion of Flaherty's runDisney medals.

For those running the four-race Dopey Challenge, that presented a conundrum. On one hand, they all got credit for doing the half marathon without running a single step.\n\nBut would it be a real Dopey without it?\n\n“I knew it wouldn’t feel like a real one if I didn’t run it,” Flaherty says.\n\nAnd so, he laced up his running shoes and headed out into the driving rain to complete the half marathon on his own. Except, he was far from alone. Hundreds of other Dopey hopefuls showed up with the same idea, flooding the planks of Disney’s Boardwalk and running circuits around the Disney resort properties as onlookers handed out bottles of water and cheered.\n\n“Runners are a community wherever we are, and we tend to help each other and support each other,” Flaherty says. “Then when you throw all of that onto one of the largest vacation properties on the United States and you add in an atmosphere of running, camaraderie and fun, it’s a winning formula.”\n\nThe climax of the Disney Princess Half Marathon comes alarmingly early in the race. Around miles four and five, racers file into the Magic Kingdom, running down the park’s Main Street to cheers of onlookers before taking a loop past beloved rides and finally through the fabled Cinderella’s Castle. It’s a huge highlight for any Disney fan, and the promise of this experience – whether it’s a jog through a castle or a leisurely loop through another park, pristine and empty in the morning hours – is what draws a lot of first-time runners.\n\nWhat keeps them is the heady feeling of accomplishment, no doubt piqued by all of the emotional beats Disney knows to hit. On these runs, large speakers blasting swells of Disney anthems and hundreds of cheering cast members and characters are your constant companions. Out of context, it’s a sensory overload. But as one mile turns into 10 and the sweat starts to burn your eyes, you’ll take any encouragement you can get.\n\nIn the moment, it’s not hard to see how one race experience becomes two, and two become dozens. Friendships are made, unbreakable running streaks are forged. Before you know it, the races just become a way of life – one that keeps going even after the finish line is crossed.\n\nPrincess Half Marathon racers head down Main Street at the Magic Kingdom, with Cinderella's Castle just beyond. Alexandra Willingham/CNN\n\nRunDisney groups abound on Facebook. Some have tens of thousands of members, while others are much smaller. In addition to the flurry of activity around race weekends, people in smaller groups post about non-Disney race accomplishments year-round while trading training tips and inside jokes about Disney experiences. Some groups hold meetups and parties on race weekends. While there are plenty of fun races and plenty of supportive running groups in the world, the Disney race experience seems to be one where the fun truly does increase with numbers.\n\nThat’s one part that David Dysart, 51, finds particularly enjoyable. In addition to the “Disney” of it all, he loves the supportive environment, where everyone is encouraged to achieve regardless of their abilities or running experience.\n\n“You see grandmas and people with physical differences; people of all ages and shapes and backgrounds,” he says. “And you can see that at other races, too. But it seems like, at Disney, there’s just more of that.”\n\nDavid Dysart showing off medals from a full race weekend. Courtesy David Dysart\n\nIt bears repeating that runDisney enthusiasts exist at a very potent intersection of interests. “Disney adults” get a bad rap, as do many distance running communities. The word “obsessive” comes up often. But the community of Disney super runners seems to break that stereotype, proving it’s possible to be well-adjusted, have a loving family, a fully-realized vocation (the Disney runners CNN talked to were veterans, insurance adjustors, computer science professionals, moms and more), and just happen to be very into Disney races.\n\nStill, people like Dysart are quick to point out it takes hundreds, if not thousands of dollars a year to keep up a Disney running habit – not to mention the training and travel.\n\nTruthfully, any serious running habit is expensive.\n\n“It’s such a love-hate thing,” Dysart says. “You do a 5K, a 10K, a half marathon, a marathon. There’s always more. More to achieve, more to train for.”\n\nDisney running tattoos mean something different to every runner. From left to right: Tattoos belong to Cyndi Borelli, Ruth Kohl and Michele Silverman.\n\nIf you want to show you’re really into Disney races, a runDisney tattoo is the way to go. It’s another neat intersection of the Disney community and the running community, both of which are known for their abundance of ink. Put them together, and you get art.\n\nCyndi Borelli of Reading, Pennsylvania got her Mickey tattoo to represent each length of race she’s run. The reason? Simple pride.She’s an annual passholder at Disney and has completed five Disney races, but plans on doing more – and adding a marathon portion to her tattoo someday.\n\nMichele Silverman of York, Pennsylvania has run about 20 Disney races, including a few in Disneyland Paris. She’s the kind of Disney runner who’s unapologetic about her motives: “I hate to run,” she says. (She’s likely underselling herself, as she’s also completed obstacle courses, 5Ks and other longer races.) “But I like the process. I like signing up, training, getting shiny, blingy medals for all the hard work. I like doing the impossible.”\n\nHer (multiple!) Disney race tattoos, like her gem-eyed Dopey piece, are a way to capture that magic forever.\n\nFor Ruth Kohl of Elkridge, Maryland, her Dopey Disney tattoo and runDisney experiences are bittersweet. To celebrate her 50th birthday in 2017, she signed up for the full slate of Disney Princess Races. The day before the half marathon, her husband unexpectedly passed away at home.\n\n“I swore I would never go back to Disney again until a coworker of his told me how proud my husband was of me and all my running,” she says. “The Dopey was the last race I talked with John about. He had every confidence that I could do it.”\n\nTo ask why Disney super runners spend so much time and money and sweat and tears on their hobby is to ask why anyone does anything at all. Why do people run? Why do people prioritize things that make them happy?\n\nBecause they can.\n\nAs the pink sun lights up a soft, warm Florida morning, the Disney Princess Half Marathon runners beat ever closer to the finish line, where cheering crowds and shiny medals await. But there are other things to be won, too: Personal achievement. Connection. Simple enjoyment. And the proof that, no matter how much life tries to steer them off course, they’re still standing at the end.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham", "Illustrations Leanza Abucayan"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/03/offbeat-derby-keepsakes-art-lost-space-nunchucks-news-around-states/39438803/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A legislative committee has voted to make it a hate crime to target someone because of their sexual orientation or their employment as a law enforcement officer. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday took up a bill to add police officers to the groups covered by Alabama’s hate crime law. Current law allows heightened penalties if crimes were motivated by the victim’s race, religion, national origin, ethnicity or disability. State Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, a Mobile Democrat, added an amendment to include crimes that target someone because of their sexual orientation. Some Democrats have unsuccessfully pushed for years to add sexual orientation to the law. Figures said the bill was a good vehicle for the needed change. The committee approved the amendment and bill, which now moves to the full Senate.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The oldest original lighthouse in the state is in dire need of repairs. The Juneau Empire reports the paint on the 114-year-old Eldred Rock Lighthouse atop a cliff in the middle of Lynn Canal is peeling. But Eldred Rock Lighthouse Preservation Association board member Justin Fantasia says the greater concern is the chunks of concrete falling from the building. Fantasia was part of a team that went out to the lighthouse Monday to take stock of what needs to be repaired. The Eldred Rock Lighthouse Preservation Association, with the help of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, is starting the process of taking over the lighthouse to better preserve it. The U.S. Coast Guard currently owns it, but ERLPA Executive Director Sue York says she’s hoping to work out a lease where ERLPA can take over the lighthouse.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state may lift the legal restrictions around owning nunchucks. The House voted Thursday to remove nunchucks from the list of deadly weapons that are illegal to own in most circumstances. The weapons used in martial arts are made from two sticks or rods connected by a rope or chain. Arizona allows people to carry nunchucks to prepare for competition. But supporters say those who practice martial arts shouldn’t have to worry they’ll face charges. They say it’s highly unlikely someone would use nunchucks to commit a crime. Critics say that nunchucks can cause serious harm and that lawmakers should be focused on reducing gun violence. The measure now goes to Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The first cultivator in the state to begin growing medical marijuana says it has finished harvesting its initial crop. BOLD Team spokesman Robert Lercher says the cultivator still expects to have the drug delivered to available dispensaries by May 12. The facility has previously estimated it would have about 200 pounds of product once the cannabis was dried and cured. The Department of Health said last month that it would automatically reissue its yearlong medical marijuana cards to the more than 10,500 qualifying patients who’d received them in the months before the plant could be sold. Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says two other cultivators are growing and expect to harvest by summer.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Officials say the state had its slowest recorded growth rate ever last year as the country prepares for the 2020 census. The state is spending millions preparing for the all-important head count that distributes federal tax dollars and influences congressional boundaries. But new estimates released Wednesday by state officials say California grew by 0.47% in 2018, the slowest rate on record dating back to 1900. The sluggish growth rate comes as California and other states worry a new question on the census forms asking for people’s citizenship status could make it harder to count the country’s Hispanic population. It’s a concern in California, which has the largest Hispanic population in the country. The state’s population has been creeping toward 40 million people.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Riders in the city will soon be able to buy tickets for public transportation using the Uber app, the latest step on the ride-hailing company’s mission to become a one-stop shop for transportation. Potential Uber riders will see a transit option alongside UberX and Black, along with the price and trip duration, and will be able to purchase a ticket for the bus or train instead of hailing an Uber. Uber announced Thursday that it will be rolling out the feature to Denver customers over the next few weeks. Uber and its U.S. rival Lyft have been working with cities to include information about public transportation options in their apps. But this is the first time either company has made it possible for customers to actually buy tickets for public transportation on the app.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: UConn students will no longer need to buy a ticket to attend most of the school’s home athletic events. The school announced Thursday that beginning in the fall, students will simply need to swipe their Student ID for admission to football, basketball, soccer and hockey games. The school says their student sections will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. UConn says there will be an exception for some high-demand basketball games, where free student tickets will be distributed in advance. Athletic Director David Benedict says students already contribute to the athletic department through fees and it was important to the department to eliminate any additional costs. The school says details of the policy will be announced in the summer.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: The garbage dumped on the state’s roadways, waterways, parks and other public areas has state officials talking trash. Gov. John Carney joined environmentalists and other elected officials Tuesday in Rehoboth to launch a statewide campaign encouraging Delawareans not to litter and to help clean up outdoor spaces. The campaign comes after a state Anti-Dumping and Anti-Littering Task Force issued a report last year with several recommendations to get residents to clean up their act. Those recommendations including enhancing penalties for unlawful dumping and substantial littering, considering legislation to make Delaware “plastic free,” and supporting public education and awareness campaigns.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The people of the district are pretty dirty, according to a Quality Logo Products study of 2,732 Americans’ hygiene habits across 25 locations. D.C. follows closely behind Seattle and Denver as America’s No. 3 grungiest city, WUSA-TV reports. Some Washington residents said they shower every four to five days – 6.8% of them, according to the study. More D.C. residents, 12.6%, said they brush their teeth every two to three days or less. And Washington residents apparently change their underwear the least often, with 18.4% of those surveyed saying they wear the same pair for four days or more. But according to the survey, people in the capital are the worst about washing their hands – 25.7% of those surveyed skip hand-washing “often” or “all the time.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Bay: A toddler stumbled upon a woolly mammoth tooth last weekend alongside a retention pond, uncovering evidence of the tusked beasts that roamed the Space Coast thousands of years ago. Monte Brigance, a retired offshore electrician from Livingston, Texas, was babysitting his grandson Colt Couch, who turns 3 on Wednesday, during the unexpected discovery. “He was throwing rocks into the pond. That’s his favorite thing to do: throw rocks in the pond that he picks up out of the bank. About half of this was sticking out of the soil, and he couldn’t pull it up,” Brigance said, holding the mammoth tooth. “Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils – and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find.” Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson says she’s officially running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, after fellow Democrat Stacey Abrams announced she wouldn’t run. Tomlinson announced her candidacy this week for the seat now held by incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue, who in his first term has emerged as a close ally of President Donald Trump. Tomlinson had previously signaled that she’d run only if Abrams, who grabbed national attention during her unsuccessful run for Georgia governor last year, was out. In her announcement, Tomlinson took aim at Republican leaders, saying she wants to see a government in Washington “without all the crazy and the mean.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An investment firm that helps educators buy homes in high-cost communities has brought its services to the state. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports business executive organization Hawaii Executive Conference announced Landed’s Hawaii expansion Tuesday at Hawaii Community Foundation’s downtown headquarters. The San Francisco-based company invests in home purchases with educators by providing up to half of a standard down payment on a home, with a limit of $120,000, in return for repayment of that contribution in the future along with a sum totaling 25% of any gain or loss in value. Landed’s co-founder Alex Lofton calls it a “shared investment in the home.” Lofton says Landed has helped almost 200 educators buy homes since 2015.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federally run sheep research facility long targeted by environmental groups concerned about potential harm to wildlife is facing another legal challenge. The U.S. Department of Justice in court documents filed Monday in response to a lawsuit says the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Sheep Experiment Station in eastern Idaho correctly followed environmental laws in authorizing sheep grazing. Western Watersheds Project and two other groups in a lawsuit filed in February are challenging a decision allowing sheep owned by the University of Idaho to graze in the Centennial Mountains of Idaho and Montana this year. The groups say the areas contain essential wildlife habitat that’s a corridor for grizzly bears between Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. The groups also say bighorn sheep and greater sage grouse use the area.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Four pups of a critically endangered species of wolf have been born at Lincoln Park Zoo. A news release from the zoo says the two male and two female red wolf pups were born April 13 – the first new litter of red wolf pups at the zoo in nearly a decade. Curator Dan Boehm says the arrival of the pups comes at a time when scientists estimate there are fewer than 30 red wolves left in their native habitat of North Carolina. The wolves – named for their red-tinged fur – have over the years been driven to the brink of extinction by hunting. The zoo is taking part with other zoos in a Red Wolf Species Survival plan to increase the animals’ population.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: City officials are hoping to attract a developer to turn a plot of land along Lake Michigan into a lakefront destination. The northwestern Indiana city is seeking bids from developers interested in building hotels, restaurants, tourist-oriented retail, pedestrian-friendly commerce or unique attractions like a science center on the 21-acre site. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the city aims to sell the property and its beachside parking to a private enterprise for at least $4.25 million. The site in Gary’s Miller neighborhood is near the Indiana Dunes National Park’s western gateway. Gary officials will accept redevelopment proposals and sealed bids through June 19.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Tuition increases of 3.9% have been recommended to the Iowa Board of Regents. The regents are expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday at their meeting in Urbandale. The increases would take effect next fall at the University of Iowa in Iowa City and Iowa State University in Ames. But no increase was recommended for the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. Officials say Northern Iowa has a different competitive landscape and student body makeup. The tuition increases are being sought because the Legislature has approved an education budget that includes $6 million less than university officials had sought.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Senate has approved a bill that would prevent judges from lowering sentences for child sex offenders if they think the victims were willing participants in the crime. The bill approved Wednesday comes after a Leavenworth County judge in February reduced the sentence for 67-year-old Raymond Soden because he thought the 13- and 14-year-old girls involved in the case were “aggressors.” The Kansas City Star reports current state law allows judges discretion in sentencing for “substantial or compelling” reasons. The new bill prohibits judges from reducing sentences if a victim is a participant or aggressor in a sexually violent crime or electronic solicitation when the victim is under 14 and the offender is 18 or older. The bill now goes to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A website is taking Derby keepsakes to a stinky new level with preserved equine excrement. Yes, it’s 100% real horse poop in a jar. And it costs $200. Lexington-based Kentucky for Kentucky is selling preserved horse turds from 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm. The 16-ounce mason jar contains a Derby dropping preserved and suspended in clear epoxy resin. “Introducing Derby Turds,” its website says. “The first in a Dixieland Preserves line of bizarro Southern resin encapsulations by Kentucky artist Coleman Larkin.” The website describes the product as “equal parts art and novelty, these gorgeous nuggets of digested Kentucky bluegrass and whatever else horses eat were daringly harvested by the artist himself.” A portion of the proceeds will go to Old Friends Farm in Georgetown, where Silver Charm lives.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: The Trump administration on Thursday moved to ease safety regulations adopted after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon blowout, the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement that the administration was acting to eliminate “unnecessary regulatory burdens while maintaining safety and environmental protection offshore.” The oil industry has been challenging the Obama-era rules, which govern the operation of offshore wells. Officials announced the final revisions at Port Fourchon, a hub of offshore drilling on the Gulf of Mexico. The audience included oil port workers in hard hats and reflective safety vests. Eleven people died in April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon exploded, ultimately releasing more than 3 million barrels of crude.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: For the second consecutive year, an asylum-seeker from the state has made it to the final round of a national spoken poetry competition. The road to the Poetry Out Loud National Finals on Wednesday night was less bumpy for 18-year-old Joao Victor than for his predecessor. Last year, Deering High School junior Allan Monga of Portland had to sue as a noncitizen to participate in the event hosted by the National Endowment for the Arts. The Sun Journal newspaper reports that Victor came to the U.S. three years ago from Angola and speaks seven languages. He’s also fluent in the language of poetry. Victor said he was inspired by Monga, who fled Zambia. Monga recited Lord Byron’s poem “She Walks in Beauty.” He made the finals but did not win.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A great horned owl and at least seven bald eagles have been found dead along the state’s Eastern Shore this year, reminding officials of the eagles found fatally poisoned in the area in 2016. The Baltimore Sun reports state and federal wildlife officials are investigating the deaths, saying the Delmarva Peninsula has a “systemic” illegal poisoning problem. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information that furthers the investigation. This year’s first known poisoning happened in March. Authorities believe the birds were killed with the pesticide carbofuran, which was essentially banned from the nation’s market partly due to it being lethal to birds. Authorities say the birds may have eaten bait laced with the pesticide, sometimes sold under the name Furadan.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legal marijuana has reached a milestone of sorts in the state as sales of recreational pot climb over the $100 million mark. According to the latest data from the state’s Cannabis Control Commission, retail pot shops have sold $104 million worth of product since the first stores opened last November. Nearly $7 million in total sales were reported last week, with customers spending an average of $41 per transaction. The increases reflect the steadily growing number of pot shops in the state, with 21 having now been awarded final licenses. The first recreational store in Worcester, the state’s second-largest city, opened Wednesday. But Massachusetts is still likely to miss its forecast of $63 million in marijuana taxes in the current fiscal year due to the initially slower-than-expected rollout of retail stores.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state’s schools would not have to reschedule up to four snow days that occurred during an arctic deep freeze under legislation sent Thursday to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her expected signature. The bill won final approval when Senate Democrats agreed to ensure it would take effect immediately. That was a reversal after they had effectively stalled the measure earlier in the week because majority Republicans stripped a House-passed provision that would have ensured some hourly school employees were paid for days canceled due to the weather – if their labor contract or employment agreement is silent on the issue. “It’s all for the kids and giving schools plenty of notice so they can do their proper planning,” said Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Clarklake Republican.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz says he supports legislation to ban the recreational hunting of wolves in the state if the federal government succeeds in removing them from the threatened list. An amendment to prohibit sport wolf hunting was added to a House environmental bill Tuesday. On Wednesday, the governor said that when he was in Congress he supported “delisting” wolves where populations had recovered, but not nationwide. And while he said he supports managing wolf populations, he doesn’t think sport hunting is appropriate. Minnesota held three wolf seasons before a judge restored federal protections 2014. Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, says the issue is personal for her because she’s from the Wolf clan, and there’s a rule against hunting your own clan.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will start allowing people with felony drug convictions to apply for federal food assistance. The new policy takes effect July 1 and could affect as many as 67,000 people. Lawmakers approved the change in a bill aimed at reducing recidivism and shrinking the prison population. A 1996 federal law put a lifetime ban on people convicted of state or federal drug felonies from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. However, state legislatures could opt out of the ban. Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia were the only states that had not opted out. Republican Sen. Sally Doty of Brookhaven pushed for the change, saying she saw “no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city is preparing to restore the building where the Negro National League was founded. The Kansas City Star reports the effort to upgrade the building near the 18th and Vine Jazz District comes just months before the 100th anniversary of the league’s founding. The Kansas City Council on Thursday fast-tracked an ordinance to take over the Buck O’Neil Research and Education Center. The building was known as the Paseo YMCA when independent baseball team owners met there in 1920 to establish what became the Negro Leagues. Under the ordinance, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum will donate the building to the city, which will spend $1 million from its one-cent sales tax for public improvements and more than $283,000 in state tax credits to restore the basement and ground level.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill that would allow emergency care providers to offer non-emergency medical assistance in an effort to reduce the number of 911 calls, especially in rural areas. Supporters say providers could fill gaps in the medical system by helping people manage their medicine or chronic illnesses, giving them a ride to their doctor’s office, or connecting them with other medical or mental health services. The bill, which Bullock signed Wednesday, allows the Board of Medical Examiners to create rules detailing the scope of the changes and a training program for paramedics and emergency medical technicians. Supporters say the measure could also help recruit volunteers who would be willing to do scheduled visits but don’t want to be on call for emergencies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Eight middle-school confirmation class members have decided against joining a Methodist church in protest of the denomination’s renewed ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy. The Omaha World-Herald reports the eight were scheduled to become part of the congregation Sunday at First United Methodist Church. But the seventh- and eighth-graders declined and issued a written statement instead. It says that if they were to join now, that would send the inaccurate message that they approve of the United Methodist Church’s “immoral” policies on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage. Last Friday the denomination’s judicial council upheld key portions of a plan adopted in February by the church’s legislative assembly and designed to strengthen the bans on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBTQ pastors.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Museum of Art’s $1.5 million space balloon is officially lost in space. Museum officials said Wednesday that the “Orbital Reflector” installation, more than three years in the making, cannot be located after a series of technical difficulties and complications from the government shutdown in January. Museum officials believe the piece, as planned, is orbiting Earth, but it will probably be a few years – rather than a few months – before it burns up in the atmosphere. In early December, the Reno-based museum celebrated as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched into space carrying a shoebox-sized package with the museum’s 100-foot-long, diamond-shaped balloon. Museum officials promoted it as the first-ever satellite sent into space strictly for art’s sake.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Supporters of a bill to repeal the death penalty are starting daily candlelight vigils outside of the Statehouse to express their hope that Gov. Chris Sununu will sign it or allow it to become law. Both the House and Senate have voted with veto-proof majorities to repeal the state’s capital punishment law. Sununu, a Republican, vetoed a death penalty repeal bill last June and is expected to do the same this year. The vigils, which started Thursday, are being led by the New Hampshire Council of Churches. The Rev. Jason Wells, the group’s executive director, says the people of New Hampshire have spoken clearly that the state can live without the death penalty.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The operators of a Jersey shore amusement park say a roller coaster there is safe after a pair of water-filled test dummies fell off during a recent test ride. The GaleForce coaster at Playland’s Castaway Cove was undergoing a routine safety check April 20 when the dummies plummeted into a hotel next door, damaging the building’s shingles and plywood. Park officials say the dummies had undetected leaks that made them lose their mass and shape, causing them to fall. They say that the same thing wouldn’t happen to humans and that nothing on the ride failed during the test, including the lap bar that secures riders. Officials say the coaster has run problem-free since the mishap and is tested daily for about two hours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSilver City: Officials with the Gila National Forest are investigating vandalism at prehistoric rock art sites within the boundaries of the forest. They pointed Wednesday to damage done at Chloride Creek on the Black Range Ranger District. The damage includes names that have been scrawled onto rocks that are laden with prehistoric petroglyphs and pictographs. Officials say the southern New Mexico forest is home to more than 200 recorded rock art sites that, once damaged, can never be repaired to their original condition. They’re asking visitors to be respectful. That includes not touching the rock art, as oils from a single handprint can chemically affect the rock’s surface. It’s also illegal to collect or disturb archaeological materials on public land without a permit.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: More than 2,000 volunteers are expected to help clean up the shores of the Hudson River this weekend. The eighth annual Riverkeeper Sweep will be held Saturday, with volunteers cleaning up shorelines and fostering native plants up and down the river. There are more than 120 projects scheduled, including a cleanup of Iona Island off of Rockland County and cleanup by kayak near Glens Falls. Teams of volunteers are organized by local schools, businesses and organizations. People interested in volunteering can search locations and register at Riverkeeper.org/sweep.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student slain while confronting a gunman in his University of North Carolina-Charlotte classroom was given a hero’s send-off Thursday as his body was returned to his hometown with a police escort. Police motorcycles and other vehicles with blue lights flashing quickly left a funeral home and started their 150-mile journey west from Riley Howell’s college home in Charlotte to his mountain hometown of Waynesville. Traffic stopped along busy four-lane Charlotte streets as the procession went by. Howell died in his classroom Tuesday after charging and tackling the gunman who opened fire with a legally obtained pistol, authorities said. Howell’s decision to fight for the lives of others fit his character, said friend David Belnap, who attended a candlelight vigil Wednesday with a homemade T-shirt with “Riley Howell is a hero” written on the back.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Deer hunting licenses in the state are taking a big jump this year. The Game and Fish Department is issuing 65,500 licenses for white-tailed deer and mule deer, up 19% from 2018. It’s the fourth consecutive year of an increase. Game and Fish this year is also fully lifting restrictions on mule deer doe hunting in the west that were implemented eight years ago following a string of harsh winters. State Wildlife Chief Jeb Williams says it’s “shaping up for a pretty decent fall.” Hunters have through June 5 to apply for a 2019 license. This year’s regular gun season opens at noon Nov. 8 and runs through Nov. 24. State Tourism Division data shows that deer hunting contributes tens of millions of dollars to the state economy.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A class at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College has helped out a fellow student by raising money to enable her to see color for the first time in her life. Savannah Allen’s dental hygiene program classmates say they were inspired to take action after learning that Allen’s participation in the program was in jeopardy due to her colorblindness. Being able to properly view a patient’s teeth and gums for indications of decay or disease is an important part of a hygienist’s job. As a first-year student, Allen’s inability to see colors didn’t pose a challenge until she began treating patients in the Dental Hygiene Clinic, according to the college. The students researched treatment options and started a GoFundMe page to raise the money for special glasses to help Allen see colors.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city might introduce a minimum age requirement for electric scooters following the death last month of a 5-year-old scooter passenger. The Tulsa World reports the city’s community development and policy chief, Nick Doctor, presented to city councilors on Wednesday the Mayor’s Office’s proposal that would require the minimum age to either 16 or 18. Doctor says the proposal is one of several that aim to increase electric scooter awareness and ensure they’re being safely used ahead of the summer, when ridership is expected to jump substantially. A 5-year-old child was fatally struck by a car after falling off a Lime rental scooter operated by his mother in the city last month.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lawmakers in the House have approved an extra $2 billion in funding for the state’s struggling school system. The chamber voted 37-21 Wednesday following hours of floor debate. Democrats championed the package, saying it’s a necessary investment in Oregon’s public schools, which struggle with the lowest graduation rates in the nation. The vote comes a week before teachers across the state are planning a day of action in protest of decades of disinvestment in the public education system. But Republicans took issue with the proposed business tax to fund the measure, saying it would be passed onto consumers through higher prices. The tax package now moves to the Senate, where it needs a two-thirds vote. Even if it passes through the legislative process, opponents may move to put it to the ballot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: With their bulging red eyes and deafening mating song, the 17-year cicadas are about to emerge. The insects have been waiting underground for nearly two decades, and millions are about to make their debut around western Pennsylvania, as well as parts of eastern Ohio and a small swath of West Virginia. Penn State Extension horticulture educator Sandy Feather tells the Tribune Review it takes several days of temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit for them to emerge. Temperatures around Pittsburgh are forecast to be in the high 60s and low 70s next week. Feather says they’ll be loud, but they don’t pose a threat to anything except very young trees. Adult cicadas don’t eat or bite and exist only to mate. They’ll all be dead by the end of June.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Republican activist has sued lottery officials over the state’s legalization and launch of sports betting without first seeking voter approval. Daniel Harrop said Thursday that sports betting should stop pending a statewide referendum. Former Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Brandon Bell and attorney Joe Larisa filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of Harrop, a member of the party’s central committee. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has said the legal advice he has seen states that voters approved sports betting when they approved casino gambling, and he’s confident Rhode Island would prevail in any challenge. Harrop says he’s not opposed to gambling, but the state must follow its constitution and ask voters whether gambling should expand.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMoncks Corner: A school district will invest in student accessibility with a portion of funds recovered from a former district official’s $1.3 million embezzlement scheme. The Post and Courier reports Berkeley County School District officials agreed this week to use $300,000 to make playgrounds more accessible and help students with mobility issues. Former district CFO Brantley Thomas stole district money over 16 years in a variety ways, including taking funds from grants for special education students. He was sentenced this year to just over five years in prison on federal embezzlement charges. He was later convicted of related state charges and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The school district is now getting more than $2.2 million in legal settlements and restitution. It will also be getting Thomas’ pension.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpringfield: About 150 inmates took the opportunity to prepare for life after prison at a job fair this week. Ernesto DiFabio was among the men who met with roughly 20 employers at Mike Durfee State Prison on Monday. DiFabio says he’s a graduate of the prison’s automotive vocational program, where he learned how to change oil and replace car parts. The 43-year-old earned an Occupational Safety and Health Administration certification while behind bars. DiFabio says he can’t wait to earn a paycheck. Prison official Monica Wepking says more than 90% of vocational program graduates find a job after being released. She says roughly 8% of program graduates return to prison, well below the general prison population’s recidivism rate of 30%.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The nearly 700-foot-long, 150-foot-high Gatlinburg SkyBridge, the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in North America, opens May 17. Gatlinburg SkyLift, which runs the year-round chairlift that runs from downtown Gatlinburg to the top of Crockett Mountain, plans to open the new attraction. The SkyBridge stretches 680 feet across a valley and features glass floor panels to let visitors look down. “Guests will be able to walk across at their own pace, taking in the views and enjoying the spectacular setting before walking back when they’re ready,” says a post on Gatlinburg SkyLift Park’s Facebook page. The Gatlinburg SkyLift is currently operating, but guests have been unable to get off and enjoy the landscape since devastating November 2016 wildfires.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A 14-year-old boy is raising money to wipe out lunch debt in district schools. The Austin American-Statesman reports Ben Hofer, an eighth grader at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School, decided to tackle the lunch debt for three Austin district campuses for a school service project, Project Citizen. The original goal for his semester-long “LunchCounts!” project was to raise $3,200 to pay off the lunch debts at Akins High, Parades Middle School and Blazier Elementary because the campuses had among the highest balances in the district. But Ben exceeded the amount and now is trying to reach $7,000 to help pay off the debts at more schools. “I can see how having money some days and not having money some days can be very stressful for the kids and their parents,” Ben said. “Lunch is essential for your day. And the school loses money because of it. It’s just bad all around.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: At least one lawmaker thinks people should have beer with their karaoke – even in this conservative state. A new liquor law has come under scrutiny by legislators and business owners after beer licenses were denied to a karaoke lounge and an ax-throwing venue. Democratic Rep. Angela Romero said Wednesday that she plans to introduce an amendment to include karaoke venues among the new sites approved for beer sales. She hasn’t decided whether ax-throwing venues should be added. “When I’m out for a night of fun with friends and go to karaoke, I’d hope I could have a beer,” Romero said. The law represents a tightening of already strict liquor laws in Utah, where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints instructs members to avoid drinking alcohol.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city is planting a variety of young trees to offset expected damage from an ash-tree killing pest. The emerald ash borer has already been detected in Colchester, Milton and South Hero, and foresters estimate 150 million ash trees around the state are at risk. Last weekend, City Arborist V.J. Comai, other professionals, and volunteers planted about 60 trees among dominant stands of ash. Comai estimates that it would cost about $1.1 million to remove and replace the city’s 1,249 ash trees. The beetle has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The city has officially renamed its courthouse after civil rights leader Oliver Hill. The Roanoke Times reports that more than 100 people attended a naming ceremony Wednesday at now-named Oliver W. Hill Justice Center. Hill spent much of his childhood in Roanoke and went on to have a lengthy career as a civil rights lawyer. In 1954, he was part of a series of lawsuits against racially segregated public schools that became the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, which changed American society by setting the foundation for integrated education. He died at age 100 in 2007.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state faces a federal court order to fix under-roadway pipes that block migrating fish by 2030, but a budget passed by lawmakers shortchanges the work. That puts the state at risk of missing the deadline and could delay salmon recovery even as the Pacific Northwest’s orcas are starving. The Legislature’s two-year transportation budget, approved last weekend, devotes $100 million to fixing the pipes. That’s only about one-third of what Gov. Jay Inslee requested, but lawmakers said they couldn’t come up with any more. Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, says underfunding culvert removal now will make it almost impossible to meet the court’s deadline.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: A “Bridge to Nowhere” will have a destination in a few years. Gov. Jim Justice held a groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for the start of work on a 3.8-mile addition to the King Coal Highway in southern West Virginia. The addition will make use of a bridge that was built a decade ago and dubbed the “Bridge to Nowhere” because the road stopped at the end of it. The governor’s office says the project will give motorists easier access to the Mercer County Airport. Justice says they’re “going to turn this into the ‘Bridge to Somewhere,’ and that somewhere is going to be your airport.” First, crews must cut through a mountain between the bridge and airport. The $57.5 million project is being funded through West Virginia Turnpike Authority bonds. It’s expected to be completed by November 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city plans to extend its streetcar route to the Wisconsin Center District convention hall just in time for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Mayor Tom Barrett on Wednesday unveiled plans to extend The Hop to Wisconsin Avenue by next summer. He also announced engineering plans for two additional legs that would stretch the streetcar route north past Fiserv Forum into Bronzeville and south into Walker’s Point. The extension plans would amount to a major expansion of the 2.1-mile streetcar loop, adding about 2.4 miles of additional route. The plans must first be approved by the Common Council.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The east gate to Yellowstone National Park is opening for the season. The Cody Enterprise reports the entrance will be open Friday morning, but motorists can expect delays because of construction and possibly deteriorating weather conditions. The road between Canyon Village and Lake Village also is scheduled to open Friday. Roads from the west gate to Madison Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs to Old Faithful, and Norris to Canyon Village, opened in mid-April. Yellowstone officials say visitors should check road conditions before venturing into the park.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/28/corn-curb-buttery-cow-six-triple-eight-news-around-states/50535587/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontogmery:Romay Davis, 102, the oldest living member of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the largest all-Black, all-female group to serve in World War II, was honored Tuesday at City Hall that followed President Joe Biden’s decision in March to sign a bill authorizing the Congressional Gold Medal for the unit, nicknamed the “Six Triple Eight.” More than 800 Black women formed the 6888th, which began sailing for England in February 1945. Once there, they were confronted not only by mountains of undelivered mail but by racism and sexism. They were denied entry into an American Red Cross club and hotels, according to the history, and a senior officer was threatened with being being replaced by a white first lieutenant when some unit members missed an inspection. Working under the motto of “No Mail, Low Morale,” the women served 24/7 in shifts and developed a new tracking system that processed about 65,000 items each shift, allowing them to clear a six-month backlog of mail in just three months. The medals themselves won’t be ready for months, but leaders decided to go ahead with events for Davis and five other surviving members of the 6888th given their advanced age.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: A male brown bear going through trash was killed by authorities in a city that experienced a record number of bear incidents last year. The weekend shooting of the bear by Sitka police was the first this year in the southeast Alaska city, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Last year, 14 bears were killed in and around Sitka, which the newspaper reported was a record for the community. Steve Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said four shots were fired, at least two of which hit the bear. Police received a call about a bear at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday. By the time Bethune arrived about 1 a.m. Sunday, officers had killed the animal, he said. Police later Sunday issued citations at three addresses for having bear attractants. Bethune estimated the bear was 8 to 12 years old and otherwise healthy.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Supreme Court denied a request from the Cyber Ninjas, a company that oversaw a partisan Arizona election review, to reject a daily $50,000 penalty for refusing to hand over records related to the state Senate’s ballot review. The court also denied Cyber Ninjas’ request to find the records are not public documents. It was the second time they had made that request to the high court, and the second time the court rejected it this year. The court’s brief order means the fines continue, as the Ninjas’ owner have been slow to comply with a court order that its records related to last year’s ballot review are public documents. The court also denied a request from The Arizona Republic for attorney fees in its appeal to the high court. The decision does not affect a pending request for fees in the ongoing fight in the lower court. The Republic is suing Cyber Ninjas and its owners, Doug and Meghan Logan, arguing records the company has that are related to the state Senate-ordered ballot review of the 2020 Maricopa County election results are public records. The lawsuit also extends to the Senate, but it was not a party to the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A fire at a northwestern Arkansas home killed six people, including four children, authorities said. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said Monday the fire happened early Sunday at a trailer home in Springdale, about 145 miles northwest of Little Rock. Emergency responders received a call at about 2 a.m. about a fire and that people were still inside the home, the sheriff’s office said. One child was able to escape. Detectives are investigating the cause of the blaze. The victims’ bodies have been sent to the state crime lab to determine cause of death. The sheriff’s office did not release names or ages of the victims. Television station KNWA reported the Springdale School District said the victims included students enrolled in the district.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Tap water used by more than 900,000 Californians is unsafe to drink and the state isn’t acting fast enough to help clean it up, state auditors said in a report. Thousands of water systems supply the state’s 39 million people, and about 5% of them have some type of contaminant, such as nitrates or arsenic, in them, according to the audit. That means people can’t safely drink the water or use it to cook or bathe. Most of the 370 failing systems are in economically disadvantaged communities, many in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural heartland. The State Water Resources Control Board has provided at least $1.7 billion in grants since 2016 for design and construction to improve water systems. That could include building new treatment plants, consolidating water systems or other actions designed to improve water quality. But it took the board 33 months on average in 2021 for water system operators to complete the application process and receive money, the audit found – nearly double the time it took in 2017. The audit found a lack of clear metrics and poor communication created confusion for water districts seeking help and slowed down the award process. Eileen Sobeck, executive director for the water board, told state auditors the board agrees the process could be clearer and faster. But she disagreed with the conclusion the board hasn’t acted with urgency to improve contaminated water systems, saying the board’s “highest priority is advancing the human right to water.” California made a right to safe drinking water state law in 2013. The water board has previously said it would need $4.5 billion to address all the needs through 2025.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two Republicans who suggested their losses in last month’s GOP primaries in Colorado might be the result of fraud filed their second round of requests for recounts Tuesday. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters and state Rep. Ron Hanks echoed former President Donald Trump’s claims about the 2020 election during their own races for their party’s nomination for Secretary of State and U.S. Senate, respectively. After they each lost by more than 40,000 votes, they requested a hand recount. The Colorado Secretary of State’s office said their regulations required any recounts to be done by machine and that it would cost $236,000. When the candidates didn’t pay, it proceeded with certification of their losses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Max Reiss, the face of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration for the past three years, said he is leaving next month to take a new position in the private sector. Reiss, 36, will become a senior vice president at M&T Bank, which recently completed the acquisition of Connecticut-based People’s United Financial, Inc. and will now have a presence in 12 states. Lamont praised his departing communications director, a former TV reporter who previously covered the Democratic administration for WVIT-TV, for his dedication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reiss managed much of the state’s public outreach efforts and became a familiar voice for residents who tuned in daily for Lamont’s pandemic news conferences. Reiss previously worked as a TV and radio reporter in Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere. His final day as Lamont’s chief spokesperson is Aug. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Town Council voted to give $24,750 to the Georgetown Historical Society, a nonprofit that allows a Confederate flag to be flown on its property. Councilwomen Angela Townsend made a motion to approve granting the funds, and the other council members all voted in favor of it. Mayor Bill West did not vote. Townsend’s motion stipulated “a committee would be formed to address the concerns,” but did not specify details. The Georgetown Historical Society’s Marvel Museum is home to numerous buildings, a collection of antique carriages and items related to Georgetown’s history. The grounds and buildings are often used for public and private events, as well. The Delaware Grays Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp #2068 reached an agreement with the society in 2007, allowing them to install and maintain the flag and a monument to Delawareans who fought for the Confederacy. It was only 15 years ago, but it was a decidedly different time, one in which then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner celebrated the installation by declaring a statewide “Confederate History and Heritage Week.” By 2017, the Lower Sussex NAACP was calling for the removal of the flag. In 2019, the state declined to provide funding to the Georgetown Historical Society because of the flag.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police said they found a woman for which they were searching after confirming their investigation into an armed kidnapping in Northwest D.C. on Wednesday morning. Lt. McHauly Murphy with the MPD's Second District originally announced police were looking for 30-year-old Selita Lee. Police said they believe she was kidnapped by her boyfriend, Marquez \"Mikko\" Antonio Parker, 44, for whom they are still searching. Parker is described by police as about 5-foot-8 and 140 pounds, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, light blue pants and white shoes. Police said he was carrying a black satchel and is armed with a black handgun. Anyone with information about this case should contact police by dialing 911, texting the department's tip line at 50411 or calling (202) 727-9099.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s population grew slightly over a previous forecast in the first quarter of this year, but slowing growth with deaths outpacing births is still in the Sunshine State’s future over the next decade, according to estimates released last week. The estimates released by the state Demographic Estimating Conference showed that Florida’s population growth appears to have peaked last year with a 1.6% rate. Florida’s population in 2022 will stand at more than 22 million residents, trailing only California and Texas in size. The April 1 estimate was 3,795 residents higher than a forecast in December, reflecting an increase in migration. Although Florida will continue to grow over the next decade and beyond, with its population reaching just short of 25 million residents by 2032, it’s pace of growth will slow to 0.8% in 10 years and 0.6% by 2039, according to the estimates.\n\nGeorgia\n\nReidsville: A judge has been arrested on charges he threatened a man who confronted the jurist about taking vegetables from his garden. Tattnall County Chief Magistrate Judge Eddie Anderson, 70, was charged Monday with felony counts of making a terrorist threat and violating his oath of office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. He was booked at the county jail and released on his own recognizance. The GBI said a man reported to the county sheriff he believed the judge had come onto his property and taken vegetables without permission. The man told authorities Anderson threatened him with violence when confronted during a phone call. Witnesses overheard the judge making the threat, the GBI said. Anderson did not immediately respond to an a phone message left at his office or an email seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man accused of using counterfeit bank checks totaling $1.2 million to bail three people out of a jail has been arrested and ordered held without bail, according to court records. Samuela Tuikolongahau Jr. was detained by federal authorities on Monday. A U.S. Secret Service affidavit filed in court alleged he presented the bank checks for $760,000, $400,000 and $50,000 in 2020 during the attempt to post bail for three people held at the Oahu Community Correctional Center. He left a Honolulu courthouse after being told the checks would need verification, the court document said. Officials determined the checks were counterfeit and the two men and woman he tried to get out of jail were not released. Court documents did not specify his relationship to the three jailed people. Tuikolongahau appeared in federal court Tuesday for a hearing, where a judge appointed defense attorney Walter Rodby to represent him. Tuikolongahau consented to be detained without bail as prosecutors requested, according to court records. Rodby did not immediately return email and phone messages seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 800 wildland firefighters and support staff are fighting a blaze in east-central Idaho that officials said is threatening homes, an important north-south corridor, energy infrastructure, recreation opportunities and the municipal watershed for the town of Salmon. The Moose Fire on Tuesday grew to nearly 60 square miles burning grass, timber understory and dead and down material in the Salmon-Challis National Forest. It’s only 10% contained. Firefighters are protecting structures in several areas, as well as the U.S. Highway 93 corridor, a major north-south route. Two helicopter pilots fighting the fire died last week when their CH-47D Series “Chinook” crashed in the Salmon River. Plans call for removing the helicopter from the river with a large crane. The cause of the fire that started July 17 is unknown. High temperatures and dry relative humidity are hampering efforts to control the blaze. Smoke has also been a problem.\n\nIllinois\n\nNorthbrook: A coyote on public display in suburban Chicago will get a larger den but not a transfer to a wild animal sanctuary in Colorado. A report for the Cook County Forest Preserve District said the coyote, named Rocky, is “happy and healthy” in his 266-square-foot home but will get more room. Critics, however, said his constant pacing is proof that he’s bored. “You put an animal in a cage they’re not happy,” said Jodie Wiederkehr, director of the Chicago Alliance for Animals. Rocky has been at the River Trail Nature Center in Northbrook since 2018, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He was found as a pup in Tennessee. An expanded habitat is in the works at the nature center. A petition to relocate the coyote to a wild animal sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado, has more than 6,000 signatures. “Because the coyote is an imprinted animal that has lived with humans practically since birth, there is no guarantee it will thrive if moved across the country and introduced to other coyotes,” Forest Preserve officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers on Tuesday narrowly advanced a plan to ban nearly all abortions in the state, despite opposition from abortion-rights supporters, who said the bill goes too far, and anti-abortion activists, who said it doesn’t go far enough. Indiana has one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling — a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. In Indiana, chants from anti-abortion activists, such as “Let their heart beat,” could be heard inside the Senate chamber as a committee wrapped up two days of testimony during which none of the more than 60 people speaking voiced support for the Republican-sponsored bill. The committee voted 7-5 in favor of the ban after also adding provisions under which doctors could face felony criminal charges and up to six years in prison for performing an illegal abortion. That’s the same potential penalty for performing abortions under Indiana’s current 20-week ban. More amendments to the bill could be debated by the full Senate on Thursday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The butter cow at the Iowa State Fair, which runs Aug. 11-21, will be showcased with a companion piece – a tribute to “The Music Man,” the Broadway musical written by Mason City native Meredith Willson in 1957. The musical based on the fictional town of River City, Iowa, celebrates its 60th year in film with a Broadway reboot that stars Hugh Jackman, who plays traveling salesman Harold Hill trying to sell a town of Iowans musical instruments and uniforms to start a band. Officials promised at least one of the 76 trombones from the musical’s centerpiece song to make an appearance. The 600-pound butter cow will have another companion piece, a relief that celebrates the 100th anniversary of Ye Old Mill. The 1,500-foot canal ride was first constructed in 1921. Couples like to float on the boats and many a couple shared a first kiss or proposed on the ride. In 1996, a strong wind blew down the mill, but a $100,000 gift from Boatmen’s Bank of Iowa helped the ride return for the State Fair that year. The butter cow became a regular fixture at the State Fair in 1911. The fair added a companion sculpture in 1996 that featured Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.” Through the years, sculptures of Harry Potter, Garth Brooks, the 25th anniversary of “Field of Dreams,” Superman and gymnast Shawn Johnson were featured.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Early voting is surging in Kansas ahead of next week’s statewide abortion vote. More than 2½ times as many people cast early ballots as of Tuesday compared to the same point in the 2018 midterm primary, the Kansas secretary of state’s office reported. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to amend the state Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. The Kansas vote is the first statewide referendum on abortion policy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June. The Republican-controlled Legislature put the anti-abortion measure on the ballot to overturn a 2019 state Supreme Court decision declaring access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state constitution. The measure would add language saying the state constitution does not grant a right to abortion, allowing lawmakers to regulate it as they see fit.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has awarded a license for a new facility with plans to offer quarter horse racing in the state. Revolutionary Racing will build in Ashland and feature an American quarter horse “sprint racing” track and a historical horse racing facility, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Tuesday. Historical racing machines allow people to bet on randomly generated horse races from the past. The games typically show video of condensed horse races. Revolutionary Racing obtained the last available racing license in Kentucky, according to state officials. The project invests $55 million and creates 200 jobs, Beshear said. The construction project is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Jury deliberations resumed Wednesday in the federal trial of New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams, who was elected to be the city’s top prosecutor in December 2020 despite having been indicted months earlier on tax charges. Williams and Nicole Burdett, who was an attorney in his law practice, were accused in an indictment of conspiring to cheat on Williams’ taxes during a five-year period ending in 2017. Prosecutors said Williams’ tax burden was illegally cut by $200,000. Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday morning, a week after the trial began. Prosecution witnesses included the tax preparer, Henry Timothy, who was cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to a single tax charge. The defense rested Tuesday morning as well, without calling witnesses. Williams has long contended the prosecution was politically motivated. Defense attorneys have portrayed Timothy as a fraud while attacking his credibility, and questioned why others whose taxes were prepared by Timothy weren’t criminally prosecuted.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills increased her fundraising advantage over Republican challenger Paul LePage in the latest reporting period, hauling in $605,000 during the 42-day period, according to documents filed Tuesday. The report that covers the period from June 1 to July 19 lifted Mills’ fundraising haul to $3.8 million, with $2.7 million in cash on hand, according to the campaign disclosure reports. LePage, a former two-term governor, raised about $312,000 for the same period, bringing his total to nearly $1.8 million, the reports said. The race is one of several gubernatorial contests that will be on the national radar during the 2022 midterm elections. LePage is seeking to become the first governor to serve three, four-year terms. LePage served consecutive terms, but Maine allows a former governor to serve again after sitting out an election.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:The Washington County Democratic Central Committee is expected to open its headquarters in downtown Hagerstown. An orientation was held Saturday by the county Democratic Central Committee, where volunteers received information on how to educate, support and encourage people to vote for Democratic candidates during the general election Nov. 8.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation to ban discrimination based on natural and protective hairstyles – such as Afros, cornrows or tightly coiled twists – in workplaces, school districts and school-related organizations in Massachusetts was signed into law Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Black women in particular have faced pressure in school and on the job to alter their hair to conform to policies that are biased against natural hairstyles, according to supporters of the law. The bill had been unanimously approved by the Democrat-controlled House and Senate. The new law defines natural and protective hairstyles as including “braids, locks, twists, Bantu knots and other formations,” and tasks the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination with enforcing the protections. Policies that limit or prohibit natural hairstyles in all school districts are now banned. The law also prohibits hair discrimination in employment, business, advertising and public spaces. Massachusetts is the 18th state to adopt a version of the the bill – known as the Crown Act – into law, legislators said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thousands who were wrongly accused of fraud when seeking unemployment benefits can seek financial relief from the state, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, breaking new ground when someone claims their constitutional rights have been violated by the government. “The state is prohibited from violating the rights the Constitution guarantees. If it does so, it is liable for the harm it causes,” Justice Megan Cavanagh wrote in a 4-3 opinion.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has voted to remove a decades-old requirement that members have a minimum of 25% Chippewa blood. Officials said 65% of voters on an advisory referendum said the blood quantum requirement should be removed from membership in the six-reservation tribe. The referendum is a guide for tribal leaders who will now decide whether to ask voters to amend the tribe’s constitution. The majority of voters said each reservation – Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, Bois Forte, Grand Portage, White Earth and Leech Lake – should be allowed to determine its own enrollment requirements, the Star Tribune reported. The blood quantum requirement has caused the tribe’s enrollment to shrink, with many children not considered members despite having a parent who is. About 15% of the tribe’s roughly 39,000 citizens are under age 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is moving forward with creating an office for violence prevention and trauma recovery that was announced in early May, said Safiya R. Omari, the city’s chief of staff. The National League of Cities and Wells Fargo Bank awarded the city a $700,000 grant in May to create the office. In addition, the city will hire an executive director and policy analyst with public safety experience, while seeking additional funds for the prevention office, Omari said. “Students from local colleges will have the opportunity to serve as interns to broaden the community-based interventions towards violence prevention,” Omari said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Federal investigators said a Springfield man robbed a bank last week after writing a demand note in pink highlighter on the back of his birth certificate and handing it to the teller. On July 20, at about 11:30 a.m., court documents showed a 29-year-old man wearing a cut-off gray T-shirt, blue gym shorts and one orange shoe, entered the Bank of America on West Kearney Street and handed a teller a note reading “Give me your money now. Don’t say anything. I have a partner outside.” The teller emptied the cash drawer and handed the man the money and the note, at which time the man left and fled the scene in a black pickup truck, according to court documents. The man was arrested later that day because of a tip. The man allegedly confessed to the crime and told investigators he robbed the bank to “prove a point” to his girlfriend after they got into an argument. He told investigators that he didn’t know which bank he was going to rob, but drove by the Bank of America and decided it would be that one. According to court documents, the man told law enforcement he wrote the note on the back of his birth certificate in pink highlighter and after fleeing the scene, he threw his birth certificate and ID out the car window. The man is charged with one count of bank robbery, a federal crime that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A 79-year-old Florida man died in a fall in Glacier National Park while he was trying to scramble up an off-trail slope with a group of friends, park officials said Tuesday. The incident happened Monday morning on Rising Wolf Mountain, several hundred feet above the Two Medicine Campground in the southeastern part of the park, spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The friends descended to the victim’s location, yelled to the campground for help and called 911. National Park Service staff responded. A search helicopter operated by Two Bear Air, which had been working to recover the bodies of two men who died in a climbing accident several days earlier, was temporarily diverted to help with the rescue. The helicopter transported the unconscious man to the Two Medicine Ranger Station, where an air ambulance was waiting. The air ambulance crew declared the man dead, authorities said. The man’s name and hometown were being withheld until family members could be notified. The bodies of the two 67-year-old Montana men who died in a fall on Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s interior were also recovered Monday, Kerzman said. Brian McKenzie Kennedy of Columbia Falls and Jack Dewayne Beard of Kalispell were expert climbers who had been summitting mountain peaks in Glacier park for decades, park officials said in releasing their names Tuesday. Both were members of the Glacier Mountaineering Society, the park said in a statement. The men set out for a climb on July 22 and were to return the next day. They were reported missing July 24 and their bodies were spotted from a search helicopter Monday morning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: President Joe Biden approved a request for a federal disaster declaration for a portion of Nebraska that suffered damage from severe storms and straight-line winds in May. The designation allows state, local and tribal governments and some private nonprofit organizations to access federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and for the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The declaration covers 20 counties from central to northeastern Nebraska. The counties included in the declaration are Antelope, Boone, Burt, Cedar, Cuming, Custer, Dixon, Garfield, Greeley, Holt, Knox, Logan, Pierce, Polk, Sherman, Thurston, Valley, Wayne, Wheeler, and York. A line of severe storms that moved through the eastern half of the state on May 12 generated straight-line winds of up to 100 mph in some places, the National Weather Services reported, downing power lines, poles and trees and damaging buildings.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Another body has surfaced at Lake Mead – this time in a swimming area where water levels have dropped as the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam recedes because of drought. The National Park Service did not say in a statement how long officials believe the corpse was submerged in the Boulder Beach area before it was found Monday by people who summoned park rangers. Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse said Tuesday it was partially encased in mud at the water line of the swimming area along the shore north of Hemenway Harbor marina. The gender of the dead person was not immediately apparent, Rouse said, and it was too early to tell a time, cause and manner of death. Investigators will review missing persons records as part of the effort, Rouse said. The corpse was the third found since May as the shoreline retreats at the shrinking reservoir between Nevada and Arizona east of Las Vegas. The lake surface has dropped more than 170 feet since the reservoir was full in 1983. It is now about 30% full. The coroner said her office was continuing work to identify a man whose body was found May 1 in a rusted barrel in the Hemenway Harbor area and a man whose bones were found May 7 in a newly surfaced sand bar near Callville Bay, more than 9 miles from the marina. On July 6, the body of a 22-year-old Boulder City woman was found in the water near where she disappeared while riding a personal watercraft. Rouse said it might take several weeks to determine her cause of death. The case of the body in the barrel was being investigated as a homicide after police said the man had been shot and his clothing dated to the mid-1970s to early 1980s.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: The state Executive Council – which approves nominations and state contracts – voted 4-1 to deny funding to the Equality Health Center, Lovering Health Center and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. The contracts, which were supported by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, would have funded cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception and other routine health care services for more than 16,000 low-income women. The outcome was the same when the council voted in September, December and January. Wednesday was the first vote since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. Republican councilors previously raised concerns that public money would pay for abortions and continued to vote no even after audit reports confirmed that funds were not commingled.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Hospitalized patients in New Jersey who have tested positive for the coronavirus have surpassed 1,000 again for the first time since February and most of the state is back to seeing high rates of transmission as a new mutation continues to spread quickly, data from the state Department of Health shows. But administrators at some of the state’s largest hospital networks said most patients have relatively mild symptoms and are being sent home with medication. The latest surge is being driven by the omicron BA.5 subvariant, which makes up about 82% of all positive cases in New Jersey and New York – up from 64% less than two weeks ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gun-safety advocates said police, prosecutors and judges are still learning how to harness a 2020 red-flag law that can be used to seize guns from people who pose a danger to others or themselves. Shiela Lewis offers training to police, prosecutors and school administrators on how to petition a judge for a red-flag order to temporarily seize guns for a one-year period that can be extended. She told a panel of state legislators Tuesday that an incomplete understanding of the current law is limiting its use as a precaution against gun violence. Just nine petitions have been filed to have guns removed since New Mexico’s red-flag law went into effect in May 2020. The state Department of Health said it plans to begin soliciting grants aimed at preventing gun violence, starting in August.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A jury was asked Tuesday to consider whether a neurologist used his thriving pain-management practice to sexually prey on six patients or if he is a victim of accusers with false stories. The case against Dr. Ricardo Cruciani relied on “survivor stories of six very different women,” assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said in closing arguments at Cruciani’s trial. “This is a trial about a doctor who raped, sodomized, hugged and manipulated his patients,” Lucey said. The prosecutor argued the evidence showed Cruciani groomed patients by overprescribing pain killers, sometimes to treat serious injuries from car wrecks and other accidents. The accusers testified the sexual abuse often occurred behind closed doors during appointments in 2013 at a Manhattan medical center, where the doctor would expose himself and demand sex. Defense attorney Fred Sosinsky countered by arguing the witnesses were unreliable, telling jurors, “You should have every reason to doubt these accusations.” He added that the witnesses “were willing to lie” and “dispute the indisputable.” Cruciani, 68, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including rape, sexual abuse and predatory sexual assault. The jury worked for about an hour late Tuesday without reaching a verdict. It was to resume deliberations Wednesday morning.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Mayor Vi Lyles won a third term Tuesday as the Democrat defeated Republican rival Stephanie de Sarachaga-Bilbao by a more than 2-to-1 margin, according to unofficial results. In Greensboro, the state’s third-largest city, Mayor Nancy Vaughan led challenger Justin Outling by more than 400 votes in the officially nonpartisan race. The News & Record of Greensboro reported that Outling, a city councilmember, declined to concede late Tuesday, saying he wanted to wait for other votes to be counted. There are an unknown number of provisional and mail-in absentee ballots outstanding. About 15% of the mayoral votes counted by Tuesday were for write-in candidates. Meanwhile, Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker lost handily to former deputy Willie Rowe in a runoff for the Democratic nomination. Rowe will now take on Republican Donnie Harrison – a former sheriff – in the November election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s only abortion clinic was preparing for what could be its final day of performing procedures, with a trigger ban set to take effect Thursday that will likely force patients to travel hundreds of miles to receive care pending the clinic’s relocation across the border to Minnesota. Barring a judge’s intervention, the Red River Women’s Clinic will provide abortion services Wednesday and then shut down. Owner Tammi Kromenaker is building a clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota, with the aid of nearly $1 million raised through GoFundMe. Kromenaker has not said when the new clinic will open and she did not respond to messages Tuesday. Planned Parenthood has said it can perform abortions at its own Moorhead facility to fill the gap if needed, but it is not known if that will happen. Once North Dakota’s ban takes effect, the nearest abortion clinics will be in Minneapolis and Duluth, a drive of about 4 hours from Fargo, and in Billings, Montana, which is nearly 4 hours from North Dakota’s western border.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio man who admitted threatening a witness after posting videos from the U.S. Capitol riots was sentenced Wednesday to two years of probation. Justin Stoll of Wilmington pleaded guilty in January in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati to transmitting a threat to injure. Authorities alleged Stoll breached the security barricades at the Capitol but did not enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021. According to court documents, Stoll attended the rally and went with other rioters past police barricades that had been torn down. He recorded videos showing this and posted them online. When one online viewer said they saved his video, Stoll warned if the viewer took action to “ever jeopardize me, from being with my family,” then the person would meet his or her “maker,” and that he would be the one to “arrange the meeting.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Crews are expected to break ground this fall for a new fairgrounds coliseum to replace “The Big House,” which opened in 1965 and helped the OKC Fairgrounds become known as “The Horse Show Capital of the World.” The new coliseum will be constructed for just over $102 million. Rising construction costs and inflation made the price tag much more than when a City Council memo in November 2020 estimated the cost at $73 million. Although a small portion of the Jim Norick arena will be demolished to make room for the coliseum, the arena will be fully operational during all phases of construction, fairgrounds spokesman Scott Munz said. The current fairgrounds arena has the largest economic impact of all publicly owned facilities in Oklahoma City, holding more than 250 event days a year, including international equine and livestock shows, concerts, sporting events and ice shows.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A man who reportedly ignited wildfires in a remote, forested corner of Oregon was apprehended by three local residents and tied to a tree until police arrived, a sheriff said Tuesday. Federal, state and county authorities responded to a radio call Monday from a U.S. Bureau of Land Management employee who reported a man was walking along a gravel road and setting fires in a forest about 25 miles northwest of Grants Pass. Ground crews, assisted by local residents, and three helicopters quickly got the two fires under control, Curry County Sheriff John Ward said. Meanwhile, three local residents located the suspect walking on the road near the fires and detained him. After being treated at a hospital for his injuries, Trennon Smith, 30, of Veneta, Oregon, was being held on Tuesday in the Curry County jail on charges of arson and reckless burning, Ward said. Court documents did not say if he has an attorney. Bond was set at $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A decision about whether the method of funding public education meets a state constitutional requirement was left in the hands of a state judge Tuesday when argument wrapped up in the long-running case. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not indicate when she will rule but said attorneys left her with a massive record to review. The case could result in substantial changes, as the plaintiffs are challenging whether the amounts and method of distribution of the annual education subsidies issued by the General Assembly comport with the state Constitution. The defendants, Republican leaders in the state House and Senate, argued funding has been growing and is adequate. State education funding was boosted in the budget that passed earlier this month and has increased by billions of dollars during Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s nearly eight years in office.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza said there would be no infringement of civil liberties with the deployment of the city’s license plate reading cameras despite concerns over a lack of public input. Although the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the cameras, designed by Atlanta company Flock Safety, and opposes the expansion of surveillance efforts, Elorza said “concerns about civil liberties being compromised will not materialize.” “I just urge everybody to have an open mind,” said City Council President John Igliozzi, who contended the cameras are essential to creating “a safe and secure environment to live in.” Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré said the cameras likely will be activated within the next 30 days. Paré said the policy governing the use of the cameras, which was distributed to reporters, was crafted over the course of 60 days. Flock is giving Providence 25 cameras at no cost for a one-year trial. The program did not receive any approval from the City Council, apparently because it did not need to be factored into the city’s budget.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette made history on Wednesday as the first gubernatorial ticket to file for reelection in South Carolina. This fall is only the second time voters will elect a governor and lieutenant governor together. Before 2018, lieutenant governors were elected separately. “We’ve had great success in the last four years,” McMaster told reporters after Evette signed her campaign paperwork. “She is fully conversant with the trials, tribulations and challenges of business. … I think that we offer a good, strong team that’s fully committed to the great people of South Carolina.” In 2018, as he sought his first full term, McMaster became the first governor to run on the same ticket as his pick for lieutenant governor. At the time, Evette was a political newcomer, a Greenville businesswoman McMaster said he picked in part because of her “fresh eyes” when it came to governing, as well as her relationships with the business community. Over the past four years, Evette has spent many months traveling the state, meeting with companies and businesses, as well as promoting relationships between South Carolina’s technical training schools, the strength of which both she and the governor have argued is key to the state’s growing manufacturing economy. In November, McMaster will face Democrat Joe Cunningham, a former one-term congressman. Cunningham has said he will announce his pick for a running mate next week. No Democrat has captured South Carolina’s top job in 20 years, and Republicans have held all statewide-elected offices for more than a decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A stalk of corn is growing in front of a home – in the concrete – at the 5700 block of W. Silver Valley Drive near Dunham Park on the city’s west side. It’s the second report of corn growing in unexpected places this week after a corn plant was found by a golfer at the Elmwood Gold Course on Monday in a sand bunker. Both plants were photographed and shared by separate people on the Sioux Falls Reddit page to the delight of others ready to relive what some consider the most positive story of 2020 in the city. In 2020, the 57th Street Corn became the talk of the town, inspiring T-shirts, memes and photos from fans across the region. The corn was later found pulled from the ground near the intersection at 57th Street and Minnesota Avenue. The Silver Valley Drive Corn is still a young plant, but Ldyia Smith, the owner of the house in front of the plant, said it’s in good hands. “I said that we could start serving street corn once it started growing,” Smith said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A Black repertory theater said it plans to open a tuition-free school for at-risk students and other groups in a historic church that will be renovated after falling into disrepair. Hattiloo Theatre said the new program is expected to begin in late 2023. Students will be accepted based on auditions, and two-thirds of admissions will be reserved for low-income and marginalized students, the theater said Tuesday. Hattiloo Theater School will hold free audition workshops in at-risk neighborhoods. Programs will include youth courses based on experience level and age, a diverse abilities course and a senior citizen course, the theater said. The school will be housed in the Third Presbyterian Church, built in 1860. A community redevelopment agency plans to fund renovations. The church served as a hospital for federal Civil War troops, and it has changed names and congregations over the years, the theater said.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The building housing one of the city’s oldest grocery stores will be remade into medical offices anchored by El Paso Children’s Hospital doctors’ offices and possibly a clinic. The Food City building at 5400 Alameda Ave. was sold June 30 by the grocery store owners to an El Paso developer for an undisclosed amount. The 50-year-old store is expected to close about Aug 10, a Food City official said. The building and the 5 acres it stands on are valued for tax purposes at $3.7 million by the El Paso Central Appraisal District. Food City officials notified the Texas Workforce Commission that it would lay off 90 people by Sept. 3. However, that number is now about 55 because some employees were placed at Food City’s two other El Paso stores, Carlos Loweree, Food City vice president, said Tuesday. El Paso Children’s Hospital officials in a statement said the hospital is leasing a portion of the Food City building because it needs more office space for doctors as it continues to employ more physician specialists.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Miniature bottles of alcohol could return to liquor stores in deeply religious Utah by the fall after the state agency that oversees alcohol approved a rule change Tuesday. Members of the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services Commission voted unanimously to allow spirits to be sold in sizes slightly larger than the average shot or glass of wine, Fox 13 reported. The commission plans to open the proposed rule change to public comment and, barring concerns, could institute it by the fall. A decadeslong prohibition on miniature alcohol bottles is one of many unique liquor laws in Utah, where a majority of the population are members of the alcohol-eschewing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Church officials have said the state’s laws are reasonable and effectively curtail excessive drinking and DUIs while still allowing people to drink responsibly. As Utah draws an increasing number of tourists and residents who aren’t members of the church, new tensions have arisen over the state’s liquor laws and concerns have grown over whether they entrench the state’s reputation as a religiously conservative place intolerant of those who drink alcohol. Alcohol regulators said the push bring back mini-bottles came from businesses in tourist-reliant parts of the state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Shelburne Street roundabout will soon be completely open to traffic after a year of construction, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Although the $10 million project won't officially be done until next spring, the roundabout will be fully functional in late summer or early, fall said project manager Mike LaCroix via email. Planners hope the roundabout will lead to a safer situation for motorists and pedestrians as the former maze of merging lanes contributed to many serious accidents. The roundabout will be located at the intersection of Shelburne Road, South Willard Street, Ledge Road and Locust Street in the south end. Workers are now installing streetlights, curbing, splitter islands and sidewalks, as well as paving the shared-use paths and roadway, applying temporary line striping and making landscaping enhancements. This work will continue for the next few months.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A Virginia company and its owner have agreed to pay $310,000 to resolve allegations they violated federal and state law by submitting false bills to Medicare and Medicaid, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Jacob Patterson, 66 of Danville was a pharmacist who owned and operated Piedmont Infusion Services. The company employed nurses and nursing assistants to provide patients with compounded ,prescriptions as well as needle and catheter method medications ordered by their physicians, the department’s news release said. Piedmont Infusion Services did not employ a physician or “physician extender” such as a physician’s assistant to provide patient care. From 2013 through the beginning of 2018, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid for high-level office visits that didn’t occur, a news release said. In addition, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services also fraudulently double-billed Medicare Part B for medications already billed to Medicare Part D. Prosecutors said a former employee of Piedmont Infusion Services came forward as a whistleblower and helped the government in its investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle chapter of the Audubon Society said it is dropping “Audubon” from its name because the man the organization is named after was a slave owner and opposed abolition. KNKX reported Seattle Audubon is one the largest chapters of the National Audubon Society, the nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats. Earlier this month, the board voted to change the chapter’s name because the man the organization is named after – illustrator, painter and bird lover John James Audubon, author of the seminal work “The Birds of America” – owned enslaved people. J. Drew Lanham, a former board member of the National Audubon Society and a wildlife ecology professor at Clemson University, called the move courageous. Lanham, who has written about Audubon and left the national chapter over concerns the nonprofit was not doing enough about racial equity, said organizations need to grapple with what to do about problematic monuments. Last year, the Audubon Naturalist Society, a Washington-based environmental organization, said it would remove “Audubon” from its name, but it is not affiliated with the National Audubon Society. Seattle Audubon said it plans to choose a new name by the end of the year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia corrections commissioner Betsy Jividen is resigning, Gov. Jim Justice said. Jividen’s resignation is effective Aug. 5. Justice said Tuesday he will begin the process of filling the vacancy. Jividen was appointed to lead the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 2018. She served as an acting and interim U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. Her work as an assistant federal prosecutor dates to 1980. The corrections division operates 15 prisons, work-release centers and related facilities. It has more than 2,000 employees.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels said during a debate he can be taken at his word that he won’t raise gas taxes. Primary challenger Rebecca Kleefisch accused him of not taking responsibility for previously being in leadership roles for groups that backed increasing gas taxes. Kleefisch, Michels and state Rep. Tim Ramthun debated on the radio three days after a television debate and less than two weeks before the Aug. 9 primary. The winner will advance to face Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in November. Michels, who is endorsed by Donald Trump and co-owns the state’s largest construction company, Michels Corp., said he “never once” said he wanted to raise the gas tax. He said the groups he was on that lobbied for raising the gas tax, including the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, came to a consensus on issues and he didn’t always agree. Kleefisch and former Gov. Scott Walker have attacked Michels over the gas tax issue.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A judge temporarily blocked the state’s abortion ban on the day it took effect, siding with a women’s health clinic and others who argued the ban would harm health care workers and their patients and violate the state constitution. Attorneys arguing in front of Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens in Jackson disagreed over whether the state Constitution provided a right to abortion. Owens was sympathetic, however, with arguments that the ban left pregnant women with dangerous complications and their doctors in a difficult position. “That is a possible irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. They are left with no guidance,” Owens said. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling – a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. Those suing in Wyoming include a nonprofit opening a Casper women’s and LGBTQ health clinic that would have offered abortions. A May arson attack has set back the clinic’s opening from mid-June until at least the end of this year, months past the start of Wyoming’s new abortion ban. The four Wyoming women and two nonprofits that sued Monday claim the new law violates several rights guaranteed by the state constitution, including a “fundamental right to be left alone by the government.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/17/peacock-problems-avocado-threat-weedy-sea-dragons-news-around-states/111330104/", "title": "Peacock problems, avocado threat: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A lawmaker fed up with her colleagues’ attempts to outlaw abortion has filed legislation to require all men over 50 to get vasectomies. Democratic Rep. Rolanda Hollis said Friday that she introduced the bill to send “the message that men should not be legislating what women do with their bodies.” Alabama lawmakers last year approved a ban on abortion unless the woman’s life was in danger. A federal judge blocked the law from taking effect while a legal challenge plays out in court. Hollis said doctors, not legislators, are the ones to be consulted about surgery, medications and making the “incredibly difficult decisions” related to personal reproductive rights. Her bill suggests the state require a man to get a vasectomy within one month of turning 50 or after the birth of his third child. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that forced sterilization is unconstitutional.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Volunteers slung bales of hay onto a table Thursday, where they were swiftly stuffed inside blue plastic bags, twirled and shut with twist ties before being dragged off to waiting pallets. Their efforts will help ensure the canine participants in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race have someplace warm and dry to bed down when their mushers stop along the 1,000-mile trail between Anchorage and Nome. The so-called straw drop is the first volunteer event of the Iditarod race, says Mark Nordman, the race director and marshal. More events follow this week, including people helping prepare shipments of food for both the dogs and the mushers to the checkpoints. The race over treacherous Alaska terrain – including two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and the ice-covered Bering Sea – starts March 7 in Anchorage with the fan-friendly ceremonial start. The actual race begins the next day in Willow, about 50 miles north. The winner is expected in the old Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast, about 10 or 11 days later.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: Officials plan to end scheduled closures of London Bridge for special events, saying they don’t want to block vehicle travel between an island and the rest of the western Arizona city along the Colorado River. City officials cited safety reasons and residents’ concerns about closures that typically have lasted two or three hours, Today’s News-Herald reports. Events that have required bridge closures include the annual Line Dance on the London Bridge; Camaros on the Bridge; and, infrequently, Corvettes on the Bridge. City Manager Jess Knudson says officials were grateful “for all the events that have been on the bridge in the past. But the city has decided to go a different direction now.” Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch purchased the stone bridge in the late 1960s and had it transported by ship and truck from London in pieces.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court panel in Washington upheld a lower court’s decision Friday that blocked the Trump administration’s work requirements for Medicaid recipients. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Arkansas’ work requirements for Medicaid recipients to be “arbitrary and capricious.” About 18,000 people in the state lost benefits because of the work requirements, but it wasn’t clear how many obtained coverage elsewhere. “In short, we agree with the district court that the alternative objectives of better health outcomes and beneficiary independence are not consistent with Medicaid,” the opinion said. “The text of the statute includes one primary purpose, which is providing health care coverage without any restriction geared to healthy outcomes, financial independence or transition to commercial coverage.” Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he’s hopeful the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A Southern California aquarium has successfully bred the rare weedy sea dragon, the lesser-known cousin of the sea horse that resembles seaweed when floating. San Diego’s Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in a news release that two weedy sea dragons hatched last week, making the aquarium one of the few in the world to successfully breed the unusual fish. The babies with leafy appendages are less than an inch long and have eaten their first meal of tiny shrimp. The aquarium is keeping the delicate creatures out of public view for now. The hatchlings come less than a year after the aquarium at the University of California, San Diego built what is believed to be one of the world’s largest habitats for the sea dragons, whose native populations off Australia are threatened by pollution, warming oceans and the illegal pet and alternative medicine trades.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Research shows gun sales in the state have dropped for the third consecutive year, and experts suspect a correlation to which political party is leading the country. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation conducted 335,370 backgrounds checks in 2019, a 1.4% decrease compared to the year before, the Denver Post reports. The state does not track the number of firearms sold, so background checks performed ahead of gun sales are used to calculate totals instead, department officials say. Department data has shown about 98% of background checks were approved, and denials were due to assault or drug records by potential gun buyers. Data suggests sales tend to increase under Democratic presidents and decrease under Republican leadership, experts say. “When Obama was elected, sure enough gun sales went up,” says Eileen McCarron, president of Colorado Ceasefire Legislative Action, a group that advocates against gun violence. “But they didn’t just spike – they went up and stayed up.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials have announced drug overdose deaths increased by nearly 20% last year. Exactly 1,200 people died of some sort of drug overdose in the state in 2019, an increase mostly attributed to the continued rise in fentanyl use, the Hartford Courant reports. “Fentanyl is still increasing,” Chief State Medical Examiner Robert Gill said. “If we had a magic wand and could make all the fentanyl disappear, there is no doubt that we would see a considerable decline in accidental drug intoxication deaths in Connecticut.” The number of overdose deaths had dropped for the first time in 2018 to 1,017, Gill said. Last year marked the first time the state reached the 1,200 death milestone. A spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said that state agencies must continue to work together and that perhaps federal funding is needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a state prison inmate who complained about running out of toilet paper. The judge ruled Thursday that the lawsuit by Isaac Pierce was frivolous. The ruling contains references to several other court decisions regarding toilet paper, or the lack of it, in prisons. Those rulings generally concluded that, while a temporary lack of toilet paper might be unpleasant, it does not violate an inmate’s rights or, in the words of one court, does not present a question of “constitutional magnitude.” The lawsuit was filed last year by Pierce and two cellmates, who were subsequently dismissed from the case. They alleged they were forced to use newspapers after they were denied more toilet paper for two and a half days in August 2019.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A couple’s new cannabis delivery service took some getting creative to keep it legal, WUSA-TV reports. District Derp co-owner Chris says because pot can be gifted but not sold in the district, he and his partner consulted a team of legal experts to make sure the business – which primarily sells their dog’s original artwork, combined with a cannabis gift – always operated above board. “When it came to navigating the law, our legal team just kind of advised us, do what you do best,” Chris said. “Make your art, sell your art, and provide the great cannabis experience that you can on the side.” Now, their business model is equal parts of sausage meat and patience. “Sudo is a very food-driven dog,” Chris says of the artist. Sudo is an Alaskan Klee Kai, a breed known for its smarts. District Derp co-owner Anais says it took about a month to unleash Sudo’s artistic skills.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A pack of peacocks that has wreaked havoc on a neighborhood will be relocated after city commissioners voted Thursday night to side with residents and agreed to have the birds taken away. It was a big win for many residents who have complained that the birds have taken control of a Coconut Grove neighborhood, mating into the night, pooping in large piles, and scratching cars as they travel in packs of 20 to 40 or more, the Miami Herald reports. Andrews Candela told commissioners before Thursday night’s vote that he once felt lucky to live in North Grove, but the massive infestation of peacocks has ruined the quality of life for him and his wife. “I don’t want to remain forgotten in a filthy, dirty peacock land as hostage to a group of birds,” Candela said. “I think that is more than unfair.” Commissioners unanimously agreed to amend the city’s charter to allow for trapping and removal of excess peacocks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Election officials have loaded and shipped the last truckloads of new voting machines making their statewide debut in the March presidential primaries, getting the equipment to local election offices Friday barely two weeks before advance voting begins. Distributing 30,000 machines among 159 Georgia counties ahead of the primaries posed a big challenge for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. A federal judge last August ordered Georgia to retire its outdated, paperless system before any votes were cast in 2020, citing security concerns. Raffensperger’s office had just awarded a $103 million contract for the new machines when the judge ruled, increasing pressure to meet an already tight rollout schedule. Georgia will hold its presidential primaries March 24. But advance, in-person voting begins March 2.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An invasive bug was discovered feeding on avocado leaves across the state and was most recently found on Maui plants in retail outlets, entomologists said. The avocado lace bug was first discovered in Pearl City, Oahu, in December and was subsequently identified on Hawaii Island and Maui, the state Department of Agriculture said. Department officials have not confirmed the presence of the bug on Kauai. The infested Maui plants located in retail outlets were destroyed or treated, department officials said. It is unclear how the bug was introduced in Hawaii. The lace bug feeds on the leaves of avocado plants, extracting nutrients and gradually destroying the plants, experts said. The bug does not feed on the fruit itself. The bug causes green to yellowish blotches on the leaves, and damaged leaves become dry and may curl, drop prematurely and cause reduction in fruit yields.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has been awarded a grant to study how elk herds move through a northern Idaho migration corridor also used by grizzly bears and wolverines. The grant, announced by the U.S. Department of the Interior on Friday, is part of $3.2 million in funding for big game rangeland studies in 11 western states. Idaho’s research will focus on the McArthur Lake area, which serves as a link between the Selkirk and Cabinet mountains used by grizzly bears, wolverine and elk. Scientists will put GPS collars on 40 elk to monitor their movements over two years and then combine that data with information from a grid of 119 trail cameras. The findings will be used to map seasonal ranges, movement routes and stopover areas, according to the Interior Department.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new sculpture honoring the 16th U.S. president is coming to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Museum officials announced plans last week for the “Beacon of Endurance” piece, designed by B.J. Krivanek. He described the sculpture in a statement as standing 24 feet, 10 inches tall. Renderings of the piece show an obelisk, with a base inscribed with quotes from Lincoln and a stainless-steel upper portion inscribed with words describing Lincoln. Members of an advisory panel will weigh in on which words to include, and the museum also plans to take ideas from the public through social media. Officials plan to place the sculpture outside the museum. Renderings show that the piece includes projections of key words onto the southeast corner of the building’s exterior at night.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A 60-day law license suspension is being recommended for the state’s attorney general after allegations that he grabbed the buttocks of a state legislator and inappropriately touched three other women during a party. The recommendation filed Friday with the state Supreme Court puts the Republican Curtis Hill’s ability to remain as state government’s top lawyer in jeopardy, as he must have a law license to hold the position. It wasn’t immediately clear how a temporary suspension would affect his status. Former state Supreme Court Justice Myra Selby proposed the punishment in a report to the court, which will make the final decision in the professional misconduct case. Selby said his law license should not be automatically reinstated following the suspension. In her 36-page report, Selby wrote that Hill committed battery, and she “finds and concludes by clear and convincing evidence” that he violated rules of professional conduct.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge on Friday heard arguments on whether to dismiss a lawsuit challenging an Iowa law passed last year that would block Planned Parenthood of the Heartland from receiving federal grant money for sex education courses. Judge Paul Scott is considering whether to throw out the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa for Planned Parenthood. It challenges the law passed as a violation of free speech, due process and equal protection rights. Last May, Judge Joseph Seidlin temporarily halted enforcement of the law until the court could decide whether it’s constitutional. He concluded that Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed in its equal protection claim and that it has demonstrated significant harm through loss of funding.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A significant drop in methamphetamine prices led to a nearly a 20% decline in burglary in the city last year, according to a police official. Thanks to the low price of meth, the theft of guns and other items from inside vehicles also was down from 2018 to 2019, Wichita Police Department Deputy Chief Jose Salcido told a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council meeting. Meth now sells for $2,400 per pound, which is the lowest price in 20 years, Salcido said. “The market is saturated. There’s no incentive for criminals to go steal to finance their habits like in the past,” Salcido said. The latest available state data shows that the street value of meth is at $3,500 to $5,000 per pound, according to a 2018 Kansas Bureau of Investigation report. An ounce costs between $250 and $500. In 2014, meth prices were about three times as much at $13,000 to $15,000 for a pound and $800 to $1,200 for an ounce. In 2019, the city reported 255 stolen guns from vehicles, a 17.5% drop from the year prior. Theft of items from inside a car fell by 19% from 2018 to 2019.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Medical marijuana is getting a serious look in the Legislature. In another sign of momentum for the push to legalize cannabis for treatment of some medical conditions, House Speaker David Osborne said the bill could come up for a House vote as soon as this week. The measure cleared the House Judiciary Committee on a 17-1 vote Wednesday. One of its lead sponsors, Republican Rep. Jason Nemes, has predicted it would pass the House by a wide margin. House Republicans will discuss the measure internally to gauge support and develop a plan for it when the GOP-led Legislature reconvenes Tuesday, Osborne told reporters. The speaker praised the bill’s supporters for crafting a version that has drawn a lot of support. Supporters point to strong grassroots support for the legal use of medical cannabis for people battling chronic pain and certain debilitating medical conditions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fire trucks traditionally bring up the rear of the city’s Mardi Gras parades – but not this year. As Carnival season kicks into high gear, the first of the major parades, with marching bands and floats carrying masked riders, rolled Friday evening. Parades are scheduled almost daily through Mardi Gras – or Fat Tuesday – which falls on Feb. 25 this year. Fire trucks traditionally roll behind each parade in the city, signalling a procession’s end. But Mayor LaToya Cantrell and fire chief Tim McConnell confirmed at a news conference on Mardi Gras safety issues that the practice is being abandoned. Fire crews will still do safety inspections on floats before parades but will then return to their stations. McConnell said the change will mean more trucks are available when needed anywhere in the city. He and Cantrell said the move was not prompted by an ongoing labor dispute involving firefighters.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: Dozens of residents told the state they’re opposed to the building of a large salmon farm in this coastal city. The proposal from Norwegian-owned Nordic Aquafarms would create a $500 million salmon farm that uses land-based facilities to grow the fish for human consumption. Many Maine residents told the Maine Board of Environmental Protection during a Tuesday night hearing that they think the project is a bad fit for the community, the Bangor Daily News reports. The environmental protection board is visiting Belfast to review environmental permit applications that are needed for the project. Residents at the hearing raised concerns including that the environmental impact of the project would be too much for the community. Others said it was simply too large for Belfast. Nordic has characterized the project as a sustainable way to create jobs and meet demand for healthy seafood.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: School construction funding would increase by $2.2 billion over five years under a measure approved by the House of Delegates on Friday. The House approved the measure, called the Built to Learn Act, on a bipartisan 128-6 vote, and it now goes to the Senate, whose leaders support it. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, also has expressed support. “I think it’s telling how important this bill is on both sides of the aisle,” said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat. The measure enables the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue up to $2.2 billion in revenue bonds. The money would be on top of about $400 million the state spends each year to build and repair schools. The debt on the bonds would be paid by $125 million annually over 30 years from casino revenue that goes to the state for education.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A traveling exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage is heading to the city. The exhibit presented by the American Bar Association will be on display at the John Joseph Moakley Law Library from Monday through Feb. 28. It’s titled “100 Years After the 19th Amendment: Their Legacy, and Our Future.” The exhibit was curated by the Library of Congress and includes photos and artifacts about the movement to give women the right to vote. Women’s right to vote was secured by the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek: Officials at Binder Park Zoo are hoping its male snow leopard hooks up with a female snow leopard he was paired with through a breeding program that aims to give the threatened species a boost. The zoo recently introduced Victoria, a 2-year-old snow leopard who arrived in August from Omaha, Nebraska’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, with Raj, who’s been at the Binder Park Zoo since 2012. Until Victoria arrived, the 7-year-old Raj was the lone snow leopard in Battle Creek. Zoo officials are hoping the pair will mate and produce a litter of cubs. The big cats were matched through a Species Survival Program breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquarium to make sure they were genetically compatible. “They do have a ‘dating profile,’ so to speak, but it’s driven by science rather than romance,” says Leslie Walsh, manager of marketing and development for Binder Park Zoo.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz and LGBTQ activists rallied at the Capitol on Friday to demand that the Republican-controlled state Senate pass a ban on “conversion therapy” for minors, a discredited practice that seeks to turn gay people straight. The proposal passed the Democratic-controlled House last year, but an effort to amend it onto a larger bill on the Senate floor by Sen. Scott Dibble failed late in the session. The Minneapolis Democrat, who is openly gay, said he plans to reintroduce it this year, though he acknowledged in an interview that enacting it will be an uphill fight. But he has an ally in the Democratic governor. Walz pointed out to a crowd of about 100 people in the Capitol rotunda that 19 other states have enacted conversion therapy bans. “The idea that this absolutely discredited, Byzantine, torturous way of telling our children they are not who they are has got to end and will end,” Walz said. The American Psychological Association says conversion therapy is not based in science and is harmful to mental health.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A legendary rodeo clown who spent decades performing has died after the final performance of the 55th Annual Dixie National Rodeo and Livestock Show. Lecile Harris, 83, died in his sleep after the show Wednesday night in Jackson, according to a release from the Mississippi Fair Commission. Born in Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, Harris gained popularity after starring in the television show “Hee Haw,” as well as roles in other TV shows and movies. He was inducted into the Mississippi Rodeo Hall of Fame and the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and won the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association award for Clown of the Year five times. “All of us involved at the Dixie National are truly saddened,” Mississippi Fair Commission executive director Steve Hutton said in the news release. “We all send our love and wishes to Lecile’s family, friends, and adoring fans around the world.”\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A southeast Missouri peach grower was awarded $15 million in actual damages Friday in his lawsuit alleging the weedkiller dicamba severely damaged his orchards. Bill Bader, of Campbell, sued Bayer and BASF, alleging they were responsible for damage at Bader Farms, one of the largest peach farms in the state, which his attorneys argued would likely not survive repeated exposure to dicamba. Bader’s lawsuit is one of several filed against Bayer and BASF that blame the pesticide for damaging millions of acres of crops across the country. Farmers have been using dicamba for more than 50 years, but complaints increased after Monsanto – which was bought by Bader in 2018 – released dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans, leading to increased use of dicamba-based herbicides and more complaints about the chemical drifting onto farms that did not have resistant crops.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Hunting regulations on wolf and elk near Yellowstone National Park have increased, wildlife officials say. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission tightened wolf hunting rules and reduced elk-hunting seasons, the Missoulian reports. The commission discussed proposals and allowed public comment on the regulations Thursday during its daylong meeting in Helena. Regulations included reducing wolf hunting quotas to one per person in each district near Yellowstone National Park and shortening elk shouldering seasons by a month in some districts in central Montana, commission officials said. Some public commenters have argued that wolf quotas should be one or none because the animals are crucial to the ecosystem, while opponents suggested increasing the quota to two. The commission also adopted elk shoulder seasons for several hunting districts covering west-central Montana, agency officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Researchers at the Center for Great Plains Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this week will discuss in a lecture the new research on black homesteaders in the Great Plains. The Paul A. Olson Great Plains Lecture is scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at the center in Lincoln. Although few in comparison to the multitudes of white settlers, black people also carved out lives for themselves on homesteads. About 70% of them settled in clusters or “colonies,” the center said in a new release, including one in DeWitty, Nebraska. The free public talk is part of a lecture series from the Center for Great Plains Studies on various Great Plains topics. More information is available online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Workers have completed the first of two underground tunnels for a system to whisk passengers between exhibit halls at an expanded Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and project officials said Friday. It took about three months, and officials say the drilling machine now will be disassembled, repositioned, reassembled and restarted for the second tunnel. The $52.5 million people-mover is being built by billionaire Elon Musk’s company The Boring Co. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year and is designed to offer conventioneers an approximately one-minute trip in self-driving electric vehicles between three exhibit hall and parking stations. The system is being called key to an ongoing, $1.5 billion convention center expansion and renovation that includes adding a three-story, 1.4 million-square-foot building across the street from the existing single-story convention center.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Cats are closer to achieving equal footing with dogs in the state, at least when it comes to their untimely demise. House lawmakers on Thursday approved a bill that would require anyone who hits a cat with a vehicle to notify police or the animal’s owner as soon as possible. Such notification already is required when it comes to canine collisions. The bill now goes to the Senate, but three other bills related to killing animals won’t live on. The House voted against a measure that would have repealed a prohibition on hunting with ferrets, another that would have created a safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve, and a third that would have lowered the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause “actual and substantial” damage. The failed bill would have removed the “and substantial” language.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMorris County: A bowhunting organization says a 700-pound bear shot in the state last fall has set a world record as the largest black bear killed with a bow and arrow in North America. The Pope and Young Club, a bowhunting and conservation organization, said the bear killed Oct. in Morris County toppled a record set in 1993 by a hunter in California. “It has been an inspiring journey, to say the least,” hunter Jeff Melillo said in a statement quoted by the organization. “New Jersey, my home state, has its first-ever world record animal!” Club records director Eli Randall said the animal’s skull measured over 23 inches and had a bone structure that he called “the heaviest I had ever seen.” Melillo recalled an Outdoor Life article suggesting that that a world record black bear would likely come from New Jersey one day. The state’s black bear hunt has generated controversy in recent years, with Gov. Phil Murphy vowing during his campaign to seek an end to it and in 2018 instituting a ban on hunting bears on state lands. The New Jersey Sierra Club is still seeking a complete ban.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State lawmakers are considering setting aside $20 million that could be used as seed money as water managers, municipalities and farmers scramble to find ways to reduce groundwater pumping that is at the center of a high-stakes legal battle. The fight over the Rio Grande has pitted Texas against New Mexico as demands increase and drought persists. It will be up to a special master appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court to eventually decide how New Mexico goes about ensuring enough of the Rio Grande flows south to users in Texas and Mexico. Right now, the system is out of balance, and Texas is arguing that New Mexico should be forced to reduce its pumping by as much as 60%. That would be equivalent to more than half of the water supplied annually to residents in Albuquerque, the state’s largest city. Such a reduction would be disastrous for users in southern New Mexico, says John D’Antonio, New Mexico’s top water engineer.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is courting winter tourists with a fee-free weekend for out-of-state snowmobilers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the plan Sunday at Saranac Lake. Fees will be waived March 14 and 15 for Canadian and other out-of-state visitors with registered, insured vehicles. New York State Snowmobile Association President Rosanne Warner says a lack of snow has made it tough to get the state’s more than 10,000 miles of trails ready this season. The state has committed $4.2 million in grants for trail maintenance and grooming, funded by snowmobile registration fees. Registration is $100 a year, or $45 with membership in a snowmobile club. Cuomo’s office says winter tourism generates nearly $14.4 billion in direct visitor spending.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state schools superintendent has been accused of using a database to send hundreds of thousands of text messages and emails for political gain. The Raleigh News & Observer reports multiple ethics complaints have been filed against State Schools Superintendent Mark Johnson. Johnson sent 540,000 text messages and 800,000 email messages that he accessed from a state database to voice his opposition to the “Common Core” educational standards. Johnson’s opposition to the standards is a major part of his campaign for lieutenant governor. The complaints allege that the messages were designed for Johnson’s personal gain and were issued at the start of early voting before next month’s primary. Johnson is in a crowded field of Republicans running for lieutenant governor.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say passenger boardings at the state’s eight commercial service airports during January were up nearly 12% over the same month in 2019. Nearly 100,300 people boarded planes in Bismarck, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Fargo, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Minot and Williston during the month, according to the state Aeronautics Commission. All airports saw an increase in boardings except Grand Forks. Devils Lake had the largest increase at 28.8%, followed by Fargo at $17.9%. Dickinson had an increase of 13.5%, followed by Bismarck at 11.8%, Minot at 9% Williston at 5.4% and Jamestown at 3.9%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine is backing legislation that makes distracted driving reason enough to pull someone over. The bipartisan bill in the Ohio Senate addresses writing, sending or looking at texts, watching or recording photos or videos, or livestreaming while handling an electronic device, among other activities. The legislation would make those a primary offense, meaning police don’t need another reason first – such as speeding – to pull drivers over. The bill would also increase fines for people who are caught regularly using electronic devices while driving. Exemptions include using a phone to place an emergency call or using hands-free functions to talk on the phone or dictate texts. DeWine said Thursday that it’s time for a cultural recognition that distracted driving is just as bad as driving while drunk. Traffic deaths on Ohio roads have increased in five of the past six years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More inmates have been released under a law that directs a state board to review sentences of those in prison for crimes that would not be considered felonies if charged today. The law, which took effect in November, gives the state Pardon and Parole Board authority to establish an accelerated, single stage docket to review sentences, The Oklahoman reports. Under Oklahoma’s expedited commutation docket, 124 inmates, 83 men and 41 women, were released Thursday. Elizabeth Bijelic, 28, is one of those inmates. She was reunited with her 2-month-old daughter, to whom she said she gave birth while serving a three-year sentence for drug possession. “It’s amazing,” Bijelic said. “I didn’t expect it to happen so soon. I’m very blessed to be out. I’m not saying I didn’t need to be sat down for a minute, but it was excessive.” More than 450 inmates were released in November.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Concordia University students walked out of their classes Thursday in protest of the Board of Regents’ recent decision to close the 115-year-old institution this year. The private Lutheran university’s board voted last Friday to cease operations and sell Concordia’s 24-acre campus in Northeast Portland. Concordia enrolls about 5,700 students, but sources estimate only about 1,200 of them attend classes on campus. Most of the students study remotely through Concordia’s online classes. Students spoke on campus Thursday morning outside the president’s residence holding signs asking “Where did my money go?” “Almost graduated” and “CU in court,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. In a poster calling for the walkout, students outlined a list of demands targeted at the Board of Regents: clear financial records, questions answered regarding the sudden closure, and a support plan for students, staff, faculty and the surrounding community.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A funeral director has been suspended indefinitely after four decomposing bodies were found at his funeral home. Andrew Scheid agreed to the indefinite license suspension before a scheduled appearance Friday before the State Board of Funeral Directors. The suspension means he won’t be able to direct or supervise funerals at his locations in Lancaster and in Manor Township, outside Millersville. At the request of Lancaster County prosecutors, the coroner’s office went to Scheid’s Manor Township location last month and found the decomposing remains in a preparation area, according to WHTM. None of the bodies had been refrigerated or embalmed. One body had been there 17 days, while another was there for 12, according to a petition for suspension. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state appears poised to raise its minimum wage. The House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday night to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour by Oct. 1. The hourly rate is currently set at $10.50. The state Senate approved a bill last week to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour on Oct. 1, and Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has said she wants to raise the minimum wage. Rhode Island’s minimum wage has been $10.50 since Jan. 1, 2019, which is lower than the hourly rates in neighboring Massachusetts and Connecticut. Some Republicans voted against the bill, saying they were worried that the steadily rising wage threatens to hurt employers and could lead to job losses, The Providence Journal reports. Some Democrats supported the bill even though they had wanted a higher raise.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is now the oldest person ever to hold that office in the Palmetto State. McMaster turned 72 years and 262 days old Thursday, one day older than James Byrnes when he left office in January 1955. “I’m glad to be living,” the Republican governor told The Post and Courier of Charleston after reaching the milestone. McMaster is only the third governor to serve into his 70s among South Carolina’s 117 chief executives dating back to 1670. And McMaster could serve a lot longer. He has given no indication he won’t run for reelection in 2022, and if he won, his term would end in January 2027, when he would be 79. Longevity runs in McMaster’s family. His father retired from his law firm at 99 after trying his final case at age 93. McMaster is still younger than President Donald Trump, who is 73. And he is only the nation’s fourth-oldest current governor.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Police say complaints against the city’s officers in 2019 were the lowest in nine years. Citizens filed 12 complaints last year compared to a high of 56 in 2015 and an average of 35 between 2011 and 2019, the Rapid City Journal reports. Last year also marked the debut of equipping officers with body cameras, allowing the department to use the footage to help investigate the complaints. The 12 complaints were the result of 142,186 calls for service and 8,243 arrests. “The high volume of work and the low number of complaints is a positive reflection of the quality of employees who serve you as well as the training they receive,” Police Chief Karl Jegeris wrote in the report. Jegeris said the department takes the complaints seriously, and when “we are wrong, we admit it, and we take measures to improve our ability to provide service to citizens.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $9 million on high-speed broadband internet projects in 10 rural Tennessee counties. USDA officials said in a statement Thursday that the broadband projects will create or improve high speed internet connectivity in more than 3,700 households and more than 70 businesses and farms. Projects are planned in Cumberland, Houston, Henry, Maury, Montgomery, Rutherford, Smith, Stewart, Williamson and Wilson counties. Rural areas around the country have been clamoring for more high-speed internet access for use in schools, libraries, homes and businesses such as farms. Funds come from the federal ReConnect Pilot Program, which provides loans and grants to help build broadband infrastructure in rural parts of the country.\n\nTexas\n\nFalfurrias: Authorities are searching for vandals who damaged a south Texas shrine to faith healer Don Pedrito Jaramillo. The damage to the shrine to Don Pedrito Jaramillo in Falfurrias, about 150 miles south of San Antonio, was reported Friday, according to Brooks County Sheriff Urbino “Benny” Martinez. “We’re really working hard on it because I think it’s really unfortunate that that would happen to Don Pedrito,” Martinez told the San Antonio Express-News. “It’s been there for years and years.” Jaramillo was known as “the healer of Los Olmos,” for using natural remedies to heal the sick. He came to the Los Olmos Ranch near Falfurrias in the early 1880s and died in 1907. The shrine began at his burial site and received a Texas Historical Marker in 1971. Falfurrias City Administrator Melissa Landin said damage to crosses and statues of Jaramillo may be irreparable.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Authorities are investigating an attack on a black missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a possible hate crime. Two men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of assault, and charging documents show a hate crime designation is under consideration. The NAACP expressed outrage about what allegedly happened, and church officials said they are concerned about the incident. The victim and his missionary companion were preparing to go to a house of people they were going to teach Jan. 28 in the central Utah city of Payson when they encountered six people wearing dark hoodies, charging documents show. The assailants shouted a racial slur at the victim, who is Panamian, and told him to get out of their “hood,” he told police. They threw his cellphone on the ground, threatened his mother and called him a “church boy” before punching him in the head and face and kicking him, the document shows.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Land Trust is giving a $5,000 award to a farmer who exemplifies land stewardship, giving back and entrepreneurial farming. The deadline for applications for the Eric Rozendaal Memorial Award is June 30, the Bennington Banner reports. Rozendaal, who died in 2018 at age 51, was a pioneer in the farm-to-plate movement in Vermont and one of the first to sell directly to restaurants, stores and hospitals, the Land Trust said. He also enhanced his farm’s soil, built relationships with customers and farm workers, and shared his knowledge with others, the group said. His family and friends raised money to create the award in his honor. The award will be given out each year through 2028. Corie Pierce of Bread & Butter Farm in Shelburne and South Burlington was the first recipient of the award last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced plans Friday to create new habitat for about 25,000 seabirds after their nesting grounds were paved for a state tunnel expansion project – a case that highlighted weakened protections for birds across the U.S. under President Donald Trump. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s office said the state was acting because of the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act that says accidental bird deaths are not enforceable under the century-old law. “Had this federal policy remained unchanged, it would have protected the birds on South Island from harm,” Northam’s office said in a statement. The announcement comes after the Virginia Department of Transportation earlier this month confirmed to The Virginian-Pilot the extent of the damage to the decades-old nesting site.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Senate on Friday passed a data privacy measure that would give consumers the right to manage how information held by private companies is used. The measure, called the Washington Privacy Act, passed on a bipartisan 46-1 vote and now heads to the House for consideration. It would require businesses or other entities that control or process the identifiable data of more than 100,000 people to allow consumers to find out what data is stored about them, correct errors or request deletion. It would also allow people the right to opt out of their data being used for the purposes of targeted advertising and to opt out of the sale of their personal data. The measure would also set rules for facial recognition technology for companies. The measure has been modeled on European rules and protections put in place in California.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday offered a conditional apology for calling a high school girls’ basketball team “thugs,” saying he didn’t know the remarks would cause any trouble. Justice has drawn criticism for using the term after a scuffle broke out at a heated Tuesday night game between Greenbrier East High School, where he coaches, and Woodrow Wilson High School. The team’s coaches are black, as are some of the players. His comments spread quickly on social media and at the Capitol, with one lawmaker, Del. Mike Pushkin, tweeting that the governor was making “thinly veiled racial slurs.” On Wednesday, the Republican governor defended himself, issuing a statement that said: “Anyone that would accuse me of making a racial slur is totally absurd.” Then on Friday, in an interview with local ABC affiliate WCHS-TV, Justice said he was sorry if he hurt any feelings, while noting others who’ve used the word.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Claims Board on Friday awarded $25,000 to a U.S. Navy veteran who spent 26 years behind bars for a homicide he didn’t commit. Derrick Sanders, now 48, argued he was wrongfully convicted in the fatal shooting of Jason Bowie in Milwaukee in 1992. Prosecutors dropped the charges against him in 2018 after a circuit judge threw out his conviction. “The Board concludes and finds that the evidence is clear and convincing that Sanders was innocent of the charge discussed herein,” the decision said. Sanders had asked the board for $5.7 million, but state law limits compensation for wrongful convictions to $25,000. Sanders’ current attorney, Rex Anderegg, didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Veterans and lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, rallied in support of a bill in Wyoming that would restrict combat deployment of National Guard troops. The bill failed an initial vote, 35-22, falling far short of the two-thirds majority needed for introduction in the Wyoming House. Under the Defend the Guard Act, Wyoming troops and airmen could only be sent to combat with congressional authorization specifically granted by the Constitution, such as declaration of war. “We now have kids going to war who were born after 9/11. I don’t think one generation should bind another generation in war,” Paul told a small crowd Friday at the Wyoming Capitol. Opponents of such measures in other states have pointed out there’s already a potential check on combat deployments of National Guard troops – they must be approved by a governor. Lawmakers defeated the bill on introduction without debate later Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/17"}]}

The real impact for consumers could come next year.\n\nThanksgiving is by far the most popular time for turkey, with Americans eating 46 million of them on the holiday, or about one out of every five birds produced annually, according to the National Turkey Federation.\n\nGrocery chains have reduced prices for turkeys, often losing money on the birds, to lure shoppers into the stores to load up on other items. The average price of a frozen turkey has fallen 13 cents from two weeks ago, to 95 cents a pound, the Agriculture Department said Friday. That's 2 cents cheaper than a year ago even with fewer birds available.\n\nIn some areas, prices are even cheaper. The turkey industry says shoppers can find promotional deals for turkey at just 49 cents a pound. Hy-Vee, a grocery chain with operations in Sioux Falls, gives shoppers a free turkey when they buy a ham.\n\n“We have plenty of birds on hand. We don’t’ see any change in the prices … at least through 2015,” said Darin Hill, who oversees meat purchases for Sunshine Foods, another grocer with operations in the area. \"So far (bird flu) hasn’t impacted us. Prices next year will be greatly affected.”\n\nThe reason is Hy-Vee, Sunshine and other grocers entered into contracts for large, wholesale turkeys earlier this year, often with suppliers who had produced and locked in prices long before the bird flu disaster worsened.\n\nThe deadly avian influenza virus wiped out 8 million turkeys across the United States, or about 3 percent of the flock, primarily in Minnesota, the country’s largest producer, and other states in the upper Midwest.\n\nAs the poultry industry recovers from the bird flu and restocks operations hit by the outbreak, wholesale prices for turkeys slaughtered late in the year have soared. Urner Barry, a commodity research firm, said “one of the tightest supply situations” on record has hiked whole frozen turkey prices to a record-high $1.40 a pound, compared to $1.07 at this time in 2013.\n\nRuss Whitman, a poultry analyst with Urner Barry, said as birds died from the virus, turkeys intended for slaughter on later dates were moved through the supply chain earlier than intended. The birds often weighed a few pounds less than normal. Several months later, the industry is still struggling to catch up.\n\nLast month, the USDA said 268 million pounds of whole turkeys were in cold storage at the end of September, the lowest level in nearly a decade. Supplies of all frozen turkeys in September were the lowest since 1985.\n\n“Is it fair to say this will be with us in the next year? Absolutely,” Whitman said. “We have the highest prices ever, the lowest supply ever. It has backed everybody into a corner, buyers and suppliers alike. And that means higher prices.”\n\nIt also means bad news for philanthropic efforts, food bank and other donation programs that are grappling with a plunge in turkey donations, the result of record high wholesale prices.\n\nDanny Akright, a spokesman with the Food Bank of Iowa in Des Moines, which distributes food to pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters in nearly half the state, said turkey donations are “down significantly” from last year.\n\nThe food bank also has noticed higher costs when it’s gone out on the market to purchase frozen turkey breast. A year ago, it purchased 42,000 pounds of turkey breast in mid-October for $51,000; this year the same amount cost almost $6,000 more.\n\n“People that aren’t able to purchase the food themselves, we want them to be able to have that holiday experience and have the dignity of Thanksgiving dinner,” Akright said. “We want to be able to provide that but when we’re down on donations like this it’s tough to turn partner agencies from those products because they have turned their clients away from them.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/11/13/bird-flu-thanksgiving-turkey-price/75719110/", "title": "Bird flu means your Thanksgiving turkey will cost more this year", "text": "Nathan Bomey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt’s been a foul year for fowl.\n\nThe average price of Thanksgiving turkey has jumped as much as 20% this year, thanks — or no thanks — to the bird flu outbreak that killed some 8 million turkeys, according to the National Turkey Federation.\n\nBut you won't have to reach deep into your pocket to foot the stuffing bill.\n\nPurdue University agricultural economist Corinne Alexander said in a report that grocery prices increased by only 0.8 percent from September 2014 to September 2015 — a lower than normal uptick.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture projected average wholesale price for the Eastern market whole turkey of $1.31 and $1.37 per pound for the final quarter, up from $1.14 in the same period a year ago, according to Purdue.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\n\"This price increase is much larger than typical as a result of the avian influenza outbreak that affected turkey flocks earlier this year,\" Alexander said.\n\nStill, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll hit your pocketbook.\n\nGrocery stores often discount the price of turkeys, viewing them as loss leaders to lure customers into purchasing more profitable items.\n\nFor example, Walmart’s turkey prices will be lower than last year, with a 16-pound premium frozen Butterball selling for 64 cents less than last year, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe AP also reported that pumpkin supplies are expected to last through Thanksgiving despite a 50% drop in yields in Illinois attributed to record rains.\n\nThere’s good news for Thanksgiving travelers, too.

Some say consumers should brace for a holiday turkey shortage, or at least be prepared to pay more per pound.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that since February, 5.4 million turkeys across 38 states were killed due to highly pathogenic avian influenza exposure, commonly referred to as bird flu. The disease, spread mostly by wild bird migration, is lethal to commercial poultry but poses little threat to humans.\n\nTurkey is big business in North Carolina which is the second-largest turkey-producing state in the nation with more than 31 million turkeys produced annually. Luckily, the state was not hit as hard as some areas in the upper Midwest, said Beth Breeding, National Turkey Federation spokesperson.\n\nDressed-up dinnerBookmark these five fancy restaurants near Fayetteville for your next special occasion\n\nCraft beer explained:Fayetteville brewer answers frequently asked questions\n\nNine poultry farms in Johnston and Wayne counties experienced outbreaks of the bird flu in March and April. It resulted in the loss of 110,000 turkeys and 371,000 chickens, according to a news release from the N.C. Department of Agriculture & Commercial Services.\n\nEarly last month, the disease was eliminated on all farms in the state and no new cases were reported for 28 days in the state, the release said.\n\nBreeding said Friday that state turkey farmers are remaining vigilant to limit the spread, with farms implementing enhanced biosecurity practices.\n\n“It’s definitely been a difficult year to be a turkey farmer,” she said.\n\nPotential Thanksgiving turkey shortage\n\nArea grocery stores are feeling the effects of the turkey shortage, and it may affect consumers’ holiday menus. Carlie C’s IGA Meat Director Scott Satterfield said he expects the area grocery chain to receive far fewer whole frozen turkeys than in years past.\n\n“The way it looks right now, we’re going to have half of what we normally have,” he said.\n\nTypically, turkey producers have enough stock in cold storage by January to put a bird on every Thanksgiving table, but the bird flu put that in jeopardy this year because affected facilities must kill the birds, sanitize equipment and halt production for six to eight months, Satterfield said.\n\nHe said he expects to have enough turkeys for everyday customers, but the store won’t be able to fulfill large orders from churches and food banks like in the past.\n\nAlso, prices will be higher, Satterfield said.\n\n“When you have limited quantities, the price rises,” he said.\n\nBreeding said that consumers with freezer space should consider buying their holiday birds now.\n\n“Our recommendation is to go ahead and buy a frozen turkey,” she said. “There’s no reason not to.”\n\nOut of this world:Chillz Intergalactic Donuts in Fayetteville closed.

Basil Hasapis, the owner of the Fried Turkey Sandwich Shop, said he had to make big changes because suppliers can only fulfill 60-70% of his whole raw turkey orders.\n\nThe menus at the restaurant’s two locations on Bingham and Owen drives will remain unchanged, but the location downtown on Person Street is pivoting away from turkey to a quesadilla menu in response to supply issues. It will operate under a new name, the Quesadilla Gallery, expected to open Tuesday.\n\nQuesadillas aren’t new to the restaurant; they were on the menu before Hasapis streamlined offerings during the pandemic shutdown.\n\nHasapis said he began to see turkey order fulfillment issues starting early this summer and expects them to continue through early 2023. The bird shortage is exacerbated by other supply chain challenges like labor shortages, he said.\n\n“This one is significantly more serious than years past because there are so many shortages not related to the turkey itself,” Hasapis said.\n\nGround turkey and deli meat have higher margins than whole turkeys. Meat processors prioritize those products over whole turkeys, which is why the market isn’t experiencing the same issues with those products, Hasapis said. His restaurants were hit hard because they use whole raw turkeys.\n\nHe said the current downtown location will continue to serve quesadillas with no expectation of converting it back to a turkey shop. But, Hasapis hopes to open another Fried Turkey Sandwich Shop downtown in the future.\n\nSince Hasapis announced the change, he said the response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive and many customers were excited to see quesadillas back on the menu.\n\n“We’ve persevered very well through this whole thing. Customers understand and have been very positive with the change,” he said.\n\nFood, dining and business reporter Taylor Shook can be reached at tshook@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/11/18/thanksgiving-turkeys-president-biden-pardon/8670281002/", "title": "Thanksgiving 2021: Joe Biden to pardon turkeys Peanut butter and ...", "text": "Two Indiana turkeys – one named Peanut Butter, the other named Jelly – will be counting their lucky feathers Friday morning.

He is TOTUS: the Turkey of the United States.\"\n\nBack then, Honest and Abe were just a couple of 18-week-old, 40-pound turkeys from California — about the same age that other heritage turkeys are slaughtered and packaged for meals.\n\nAs President Trump pardoned two more turkeys on Tuesday, Honest and Abe are gobbling up their second chance at life and living out the remainder of their days in Morven Park, an idyllic 1,000-acre historic estate in Northern Virginia that was once home to the late Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis.\n\nLife on the estate\n\nHonest and Abe don't have anything to say about their lives in Morven Park. (They did not respond to questions about their lives as rehabilitated turkeys and their plans for Thanksgiving.)\n\nAnswering questions on their behalf: Jackie Wright Ly, Morven Park's museum engagement manager (and resident turkey wrangler).\n\nHonest and Abe spend their days in an enclosure atop the estate's Turkey Hill, with one other poultry pal: George, who was raised in the same flock as Honest and Abe. But unlike his pardoned pals, he spent his 2015 Thanksgiving ringing the bell on the New York Stock Exchange before heading into retirement at Morven Park.\n\nAt first glance, it can be hard to tell the three birds apart. George has a large right foot, so he's a bit easier to identify. As for Abe and Honest, it all comes down to personality: Abe is at the top of the pecking order.\n\n\"He likes to show off his dominance,\" Wright Ly said. This usually happens at feeding times, she said.\n\nMore:Meet Wishbone and Drumstick, the turkeys President Trump plans to pardon\n\nMore:With turkey pardon, Trump spares Drumstick and Wishbone from Thanksgiving dinner\n\nBut overall, the lives of the three bird friends are not at all foul. Honest, Abe and George are nearly two-and-a-half years old, basically senior citizens in a world where turkeys bred for eating usually only make it to a few months old.\n\nThey are fed once a day, and then they're free to roam around their enclosure. In warmer days, school children come by and visit on field trips. During the winter, the turkeys stay cooped up, with heat lamps to keep them warm.\n\nA tribute to years gone by\n\nTheir lives at Morven Park are an homage to the estate's past. Before he jumped into politics, former governor Westmoreland Davis turned part of his estate into one of the largest turkey-producing farms in the United States, even though he didn't have a background in agriculture.\n\nThe estate's poultry operations were shut down after Davis's death in 1942, and the estate itself is now run as a nonprofit. The pardoned birds' enclosure is located on the lands that were once a part of the turkey farm's operations.\n\nAccording to Wright Ly, a former staffer at Morven Park campaigned the National Turkey Federation, which works with the White House on the annual pardoning, to have the pardoned turkeys sent to the estate.\n\nBefore 2013, pardoned birds were sent to live out their days at Frying Pan Farm Park in Herndon, Va., Disney's Circle D Ranch (after they served as the grand marshals of Disneyland's Thanksgiving parade, thanks to President George W. Bush) and George Washington's estate, Mount Vernon.\n\nMorven Park's lobbying eventually worked, and the turkeys pardoned by President Obama from 2013 to 2015 ended up at the estate.\n\nThe good life isn't cheap\n\nIt is costly to keep the pardoned turkeys, though, since their annual care is estimated to range between $20,000 and $25,000, Wright Ly said. The estate won't have any new pairs of presidential pardoned pairs in the near future.\n\n\"We're not sure we're ready for more turkeys once these guys leave us,\" Wright Ly said, noting it was a resource decision.\n\nSo how long will Honest, Abe and George flock together before one of them flies to that coop in the sky?\n\nIt's unclear, since they're already much older than most heritage turkeys are ever meant to be. The 2013 pardoned turkeys, Caramel and Popcorn, and the 2014 turkeys, Mac and Cheese, all died of natural causes during their time on the estate.\n\nFor now, Abe and Honest get to hold on to their positions as the most senior pardoned turkeys in the United States.\n\nThe 2016 pair, Tater and Tot, are living their own best lives down in an enclosure at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va.

Funko founder Mike Becker's first foray into toy figures was the creation of a Wacky Wobbler figure of the Bob's Big Boy character.

It came from the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office, courtesy of her daughter.\n\nThe gift was the ashes of her son James, who died five years earlier of a heart attack at the age of 43. His family had authorized a county cremation because no one had the money to bury him.\n\n“It was such a great gift in every way possible,” Merinar said.\n\nUnclaimed: the story of Maryanne VierickUnclaimed: Daughter reunited with her birth mother's ashes\n\nEven better, her daughter didn’t have to pay the $750 fee to retrieve the ashes.\n\nThe family benefited from changes that the coroner’s office has introduced to reduce the number of unclaimed remains in its possession.\n\nMontgomery County currently has cremated remains of 96 people who’ve died since 2007. Their relatives have declined to claim them, or the office has failed to find living next of kin.\n\nThe number was higher before this news organization began investigating the rising number of unclaimed dead in Pennsylvania and New Jersey as part of its “Unclaimed” series.\n\nSome of the dead slipped through the cracks in an increasingly burdened system. But over the last six months, Montgomery County has released the remains of 24 people.\n\nSome had been in storage as long as a decade. A dozen were stillbirths and fetal remains sent to a Bucks County funeral home.\n\nChief Deputy Coroner Alexander Balacki has credited the “Unclaimed” series with inspiring changes that have gone beyond clearing out storage space in a county government office.\n\nA plan to post unclaimed cremation logs the county’s public website comes with hopes it will generate leads to help identify next of kin. A new program seeks to reunite family and friends with long-abandoned dead. A new protocol flags individuals whose veteran status is unknown and forwards the name to the county’s Veterans Affairs department to request a check for military records.\n\n“So no one slips through the cracks,” Balacki said.\n\nSuch military record checks would have prevented four unclaimed veterans whose remains have since been interred, from languishing in storage for years.\n\nAt the time of his 2014 death, the coroner’s office was aware Pottstown resident Edward Ryan Jr., 68, had served in the armed forces, but did not know if he had been honorably discharged, an eligibility requirement to be interred in a veteran cemetery.\n\nBut Balacki recently reviewed Ryan’s old file, found it mentioned military service, and forwarded Ryan’s name to the county Veterans Affairs office.\n\nThe office confirmed Ryan was eligible and filed the paperwork to have him buried with full military honors. He will be included in the February unclaimed veteran memorial service at Washington Crossing National Veterans Cemetery on Thursday.\n\nMore: Who was Michelle McGinnis?She lost her childhood friend once. When she found her, it was too late. Or was it?\n\nHis Personal Quest\n\nBalacki attributes the 2015 death of Frances Salinger with providing the roots of his commitment to the unclaimed dead.\n\nThe nursing home where the 92-year-old Salinger lived had no family contact listed for her.\n\nBalacki dug into her life, but found the immediate relatives her parents and son were dead. The office then submitted her information to an online group of volunteer genealogy sleuths that help coroners and medical examiners with unclaimed dead.\n\nMeanwhile, Salinger’s body was accepted for donation to a medical school.\n\nMore stories of the unclaimed deadReclaiming dead gives closure for Bucks, Montgomery, Burlington counties families\n\nNearly a year later, the online sleuths contacted Balacki. They found the name of her husband who died in 1983 and the Montgomery County cemetery where he was buried.\n\nOne more thing, the group found out: next to his plot was one for Frances.\n\n“It was very important to us and very important to me, personally, to get her back to her husband,” Balacki said.\n\nIt would be another year before Salinger’s body was cremated and her ashes returned to Balacki. He made arrangements with the cemetery when he decided to review her file one more time.\n\nHe found an obituary for Salinger’s son that mentioned a granddaughter. A quick internet search found a phone number for her.\n\nHe called the granddaughter and explained what happened and that he was taking her grandmother to the cemetery that day. The woman then asked to come and get the remains.\n\n“That was a great feeling,” Balacki said. “I just wanted to continue that.”\n\nRemoving barriers that keep the dead unclaimed\n\nLast September Balacki implemented what he calls the five-year look-back program, which gives family who terminated legal rights to deceased relatives, or friends of the deceased, the opportunity to take them home now.\n\nThe program targets individuals who have been dead at least five years and waives the normal $750 county cremation fee charged after one year post-cremation. Staff review a few files at a time when they have downtime and attempt to contact previously identified relatives about the option to retrieve remains.\n\nCurrently, 61 of the 95 remaining unclaimed remains in Montgomery County’s possession roughly 70% were family-authorized county cremations, according to county data.\n\nThe new program addresses what Balacki and others believe is a significant reason families turn to county cremations: the inability to pay for even a direct cremation of a body, which can cost $1,000 or more.\n\n“This is going on all the time. I can’t count how many times I’ve been on the phone with families, and grandpa dies and they can’t put together $800 for a direct cremation,” said Joshua Slocum, executive director of the National Funeral Consumers Alliance in Vermont.\n\nSome states provide cremations for the poor, and some counties offer financial assistance, but they are the exceptions, Slocum said.\n\n“Some places the system is punitive and cruel when a family can’t pay for cremation and with (government-funded) cremations they are keeping the ashes,” he added. ”’I sincerely believe most people are not out on the make to get grandma a county cremation.”\n\nFinding a Healing Peace\n\nHer daughter didn’t know about the new look-back program when she contacted the Montgomery County Coroner in early December about retrieving her brother’s remains, Carol Merinar said.\n\n“My daughter is so generous,” she added. “She wanted to do that even though she knew it would cost her a bit of money.”\n\nJames, her youngest child, was a “Dennis the Menace” the kid. His curiosity sometimes got him in trouble, like when he was 9 years old and he and a neighbor went joy riding in a golf cart.\n\nHe loved people, and loved helping others, Merinar said. He liked softball and wrestling. He was small for his age and kids gave him a hard time, she said.\n\nAfter he graduated high school he worked as a handyman doing electrical, plumbing heating and air-conditioning work with his father. He learned bricklaying and cement work. He was married briefly, but had no children, she said.\n\nWhen James died, he had no insurance to bury him, Merinar said.\n\n“It happened so fast. We couldn’t even think,” she said. “The (coroner’s office) said they store people and when wanted could take him out. We felt so bad at leaving him at the morgue.”\n\nEditor's note: This story originally appeared in the Bucks County Courier Times on Feb. 26, 2020", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2014/11/05/pet-talk-say/18483759/", "title": "If your pet could talk, what would it say?", "text": "If my dog could talk we would probably have an argument over who gets to sleep in my bed.\n\nSharon Busch,Grade 6, Judson\n\nIf my pet gerbil, Lily, could talk she would tell me to get her a huge mansion cage with 100 rooms.

When you first started seeing Christmas items in stores in late summer, it was enough to make you shake your head – not your jingle bells.\n\nBut there's one growing Christmas tradition we don't mind kicking off a bit earlier: Delaware's Christmas pop-up bar scene.\n\nAfter all, we all could use a little extra cheer, right?\n\nThe decorations, specialty cocktails, holiday-themed bar bites and selfie spots that come with the pop-ups are coming online – both old favorites such as Wilmington's Blitzen and the Sleigh Bar at Klondike Kate's in Newark revving back up, along with newbies like the one at Starboard Claw, dubbed Santa Claws.\n\nSanta Claws was the first to open on Thursday, Nov. 7, with The Sleigh Bar not far behind on Wednesday, Nov. 13.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nSome lean heavily into a Christmas theme, while others stick to a more generic holiday theme.\n\nEither way, these limited-time-only bars are a fun shot in the arm to the post-summer bar scene, adding a dash of excitement because as we all know that a cold winter is soon upon us.\n\nSo whether you like to get a group of friends together and do a monthlong bar hop to celebrate at each of the pop-ups or are just looking for something different for one night with your special person, here's a look at what the First State has to offer.\n\nBlitzen (220 W. Ninth St., Wilmington)\n\nIn its sixth year, the close quarters of Blitzen remain a hit judging by the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds that fill it on busy nights.\n\nThis year its doors will first open on Friday, Nov. 22, at 4 p.m. and the fun will be offered Wednesday through Saturday until Saturday, Dec. 21. It will be open 4 p.m. to midnight each day, but is closed Thanksgiving.\n\nWith a snow machine out front turning Ninth Street into a winter wonderland, the popular pop-up will mirror last year's run.\n\nYou'll find many of the same fanciful decorations, selfie spots and fun cocktails with cheeky names such as Resting Blitz Face and Big Elf Energy. Others include Sleigh All Day made with gingerbread whiskey and allspice, along with All the Jingle Ladies, a mix of homemade chai syrup with coconut rum and coffee liqueur.\n\nDon't miss their shotskis, which let four or eight people to take simultaneous seasonal shots, or hot drinks, including hot apple cider with bourbon or hot chocolate with Rumple Minze.\n\nFor the second year, there will be a small food menu thanks to the kitchen they built last year. Offerings include hand-cut french fries, Sugar Plum Barbecue Chicken Bites and beignets.\n\nSlower times are Wednesdays and Thursdays from 4 to 6 or 7 p.m. if you're looking for some space at the bar. It's pretty busy on Fridays and Saturdays from the moment they open, but the crowds dissipate a bit after 10 p.m. generally.\n\nThe Sleigh Bar at Klondike Kate's Restaurant & Saloon (158 E. Main St., Newark)\n\nAlso first popping up in 2019, The Sleigh Bar takes over Kate's each winter and draws major crowds just like Blitzen.\n\nExpect a lot of the same: spectacular decorations paired with Christmas-y drinks and snacks with a touch of a Grinch theme. There's even a large, luxurious sled for you and your friends to pile into for photos.\n\nThe pop-up opened to the public on Wednesday, Nov. 13, after its private opening party.\n\nTheir specialty Sleigh Bar menu is back with plenty of fun snacks that may cause you to loosen that belt, Santa-style.\n\nNew entrants include Grinch’s Best Friend (Lit'l Smokies wrapped in a puff pastry dyed green) and Grinch Dip (spinach and artichoke dip, also green, served with crostini.)\n\nComing back this year: Holiday Egg Rolls (turkey, gravy, stuffing and cranberry relish wrapped in a deep-fried wanton and served with extra gravy and cranberry relish for dipping), Candy Cane Caprese (grape tomatoes and marinated mozzarella bocconcini balls skewered and served with a basil and balsamic glaze), and other savory goodies.\n\nAnd when it comes to drinks, holiday-style beers and holiday shots share bar space with a specialty cocktail menu.\n\nNewbie cocktails include Martha May (a classic orange crush, dyed green and served in a Grinch head souvenir cup); You’re a Mean One (hot coffee with Makers Mark bourbon and peppermint cream topped with whipped cream and crushed peppermint), and The Heart Warmer (vanilla vodka, Irish cream and hot cocoa topped with chocolate syrup, graham crackers and roasted marshmallow fluff.)\n\nReturning drinks also have festive names, such as Frosty the Snowman, The Gingerbread, Reindeer Mule, The Feliz Navidad and a Christmas Cookie Shot.\n\nAnd there also will be mocktails added to the mix: Not So Naughty Sangria (homemade spiced simple syrup, alcohol-removed red blend and orange juice served with a dehydrated orange slice and a cinnamon stick) and Designated Reindeer (a nonalcoholic version of their Rudolph’s Red Nosed Mule (ginger beer, cranberry juice and lime).\n\nThe big man himself, Santa Claus, will be there Wednesdays, Dec. 4, 11 and 18, for a meet-and-greet from 6 to 8 p.m. while kids eat free. Kate’s brunch with Santa will be held Sunday, Dec. 15, with two seatings: 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Tickets must be purchased online at klondikekates.com.\n\nAnd this year, the Grinch will be there for selfies with adults Thursdays, Dec. 5, 12 and 19, from 9 to 11 p.m.\n\nSanta Claws at Starboard Claw (1818 Coastal Highway, Dewey Beach)\n\nFor the first time, Starboard Claw is rebranding as a pop-up Christmas bar with a just-perfect name: Santa Claws.\n\nThe bar was recently closed for three days for decorating – inside and out.\n\nThe new look runs through the end of December. It is open Monday through Friday from 4 to 11 p.m. and from noon to 11 p.m. on weekends.\n\nSanta Claws has its own special menu, which will run alongside the regular menu.\n\nSanta Claws brings in a dozen new holiday-themed cocktails, including Cranberry Bramble, Fireside, the Grinch Tini, Holiday Mule, Mistletoe Magic-Tini, Peppermint ClawTini, Sugar Mountain Martini, Prancer's Punch, Santa Clos Crush, Spiced Cider Margarita, Tiramisu Martini, and Winter Wonderland.\n\nTwo hot drinks are up for grabs, too. A Chocolate Candy Cane of hot cocoa, Baileys Irish cream, peppermint schnapps and marshmallows, as well as the Hot Toddy made with Jim Beam bourbon, lemon juice, honey and hot water.\n\nAnd there also are eight specially made appetizers to go with the new drinks, including both savory (Baked Brie and Salami Sled, Candy Cane Pretzel, Mozzarella Log Stack, Santa Claws & Shrimp Cocktail and Winter Caprese Wreath) and sweet (Santa's Cookie Plate, Granny's Turnover and Smore's Table Tray.)\n\nSchellville: Enchanted Winter Celebration (36470 Seaside Outlet Drive, near Rehoboth Beach)\n\nIn its seventh year, Schellville gets into the holiday spirit once again and is just as popular as Blitzen and The Sleigh Bar.\n\nIn fact, it welcomes many more merry-seekers due to its sheer size.\n\nSchell Brothers, the dominant homebuilding company at Delaware's beaches, operates the 5½-acre Christmas village, which is free to enter.\n\nAnd this year you don't need to reserve tickets ahead of time like in years past. You just show up.\n\nSchellville features include a skating rink, playground, fake \"magical\" snow every 15 minutes, a \"Snow Zone\" for snowball fights, a \"sledding\" slide, miniature Christmas village, mini-golf, a ride-on train, Christmas tree maze, beer garden, fire pits and more than 1,000 Christmas trees. (Got all that?)\n\nThrow in Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus, live music, multiple bars (including a Santa Claws-branded Starboard bar) and more than 30 vendors and food trucks, and you can understand why it's a magnet for families and couples alike.\n\nLive music highlights include local favorites Go Go Gadget (Nov. 30 and Dec. 26), Lower Case Blues (Dec. 5), Lost in Paris (Dec. 21), Funsters (Dec. 22) and Kristen & the Noise (Dec. 28).\n\nSchellville is open Nov. 16-17, Nov. 22-24, Nov. 30-Dec. 1, Dec. 5-8, Dec. 12-23 and Dec. 26-30. Its final day is Tuesday, Dec. 31, from 4 to 7 p.m. only.\n\nEach day of operation, Schellville runs from 1 to 4 p.m. for its quieter hours, more aimed toward toddlers, older adults and guests with special needs. A second session runs 5 to 9 p.m. daily.\n\nYuletide Cantina at Big Chill Surf Cantina (19406 Coastal Highway, near Rehoboth Beach)\n\nIn its second year, Big Chill Surf Cantina will once again transform into the 21-and-older-only Yuletide Cantina.\n\nThe Baja, Mexico-inspired spot will be heavily decorated and bartenders will sling up a special menu of cocktails including SleighRide Sangria, Cranberry Mule, Candy Cane Crush, Kringle's Espresso Martini, Navidad Sunrise, Coco Noel Margarita, Jingle Juice and the Coquito Cocktail.\n\nIt runs from Friday, Nov. 22, to Sunday, Jan. 5, every day from noon to 1 a.m.\n\nThe holiday event calendar includes holiday-themed trivia every Wednesday night. And if you're around Wednesday, Nov. 27, they will host a special Friendsgiving party for everyone back in town for the holiday with DJ Gregg from 9 p.m. to close\n\nThe main event for Yuletide Cantina is Cantina Claus on Tuesday, Dec. 17, from 8 to 11 p.m.\n\nPatrons are encouraged to dress up for this SantaCon-inspired party with a prize going to the best dressed. True Country will be on stage from 8 to 11 p.m.\n\nLIT at Delaware Park Casino (777 Delaware Park Blvd., Stanton)\n\nBack for its second year, Delaware Park Casino's LIT is back, gussied up in so many Christmas lights that you may need to wear sunglasses.\n\nIt opens Friday, Nov. 29, at 6 p.m. and will be open through the end of December on Fridays and Saturdays from 6 p.m. to midnight with a DJ from 8 p.m. to midnight each evening.\n\nExpect and explosion of decorations, lights and a new Elfie Selfie station.\n\nFor the first time, they will host holiday theme nights, including a Silver & Gold Party (Saturday, Nov. 30), Flannel Night (Saturday, Dec. 7), Ugly Sweater Night (Saturday, Dec. 14) and \"Merry Grinchmas\" (Saturday, Dec. 21) with guests encouraged to dress in their Grinch gear.\n\nSANTA EXPRESSPost office sets deadlines for Christmas packages; what to know\n\nTHANKSGIVING OUTLooking for an easy Thanksgiving meal? Here are some options to go with the NFL games\n\nSpecialty drinks include their returning Yule Mule (Stateside vodka, ginger beer, lime juice and cranberry juice garnished with fresh cranberries) along with a new Peppermint White Russian. Also new: an easy-to-carry \"Polar Pouch\" filled with Jingle Juice.\n\nIt's the only Christmas bar in the state where you just might win money to help pay for all those holiday gifts you've been buying.\n\nAnd if you're not looking for a bar or casino scene, there's one other option for you.\n\nDelaware Park is hosting a free family-friendly “Festival of Lights” from 4 to 10 p.m. every Friday and Saturday from Nov. 29 to Dec. 21.

He didn't want to change it.\n\nSo, he and the restaurant group's staff members spent about three weeks searching stores and googling businesses for a real sleigh.\n\nHOT TREND:Blitzen, a new Christmas-themed pop-up bar, is opening in downtown Wilmington this week\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThey finally tracked down a one-horse open sleigh in Philadelphia — the last one left — and had it delivered Monday, Nov. 25, to the 158 E. Main St. restaurant.\n\nThere was just one small problem when it arrived: The life-size sleigh was too big to fit through the doors of the landmark Newark restaurant.\n\nA little Christmas magic, some elbow grease and some sturdy tools solved the problem.\n\n\"We just had to take the restaurant's front doors off,\" Manerchia says, laughing.\n\nThe Sleigh Bar at Klondike Kate's, which is all lit up like, well, a Christmas tree, officially opens to the public Wednesday, Nov. 27, at lunchtime. Live music begins at 7 p.m. with a deejay beginning at 10 p.m.\n\nToo old to sit on Santa's lap? How about resting elbows with him at a Christmas-themed bar?\n\nOne of the fastest growing traditions of the season is a holiday pop-up bar. The trend started about five years ago in bigger cities like New York and Los Angeles. Since then, the clever idea of combining cocktails, Christmas cheer and a lot of kitsch and tinsel has become a nationwide phenomenon.\n\nHOLIDAY FOODS:Churches are gearing up for annual Christmas cookie and lobster sales\n\nIn Delaware, designer Dallas Shaw started decking the halls in late October at Blitzen in downtown Wilmington.\n\nThe seasonal Christmas bar, from Stitch House Brewery owner Dan Sheridan and others, now occupies the site of the former Pochi restaurant at 220 W. Ninth St.\n\nThe Sleigh Bar at Klondike Kate's is opening on Nov. 27, the day before Thanksgiving, which is widely considered the most popular bar night of the year.\n\nManerchia says for the past two years he was trying to convince his boss, Gianmarco Martuscelli, owner of the Martuscelli Restaurant Group, to let him put together a holiday bar after seeing and reading about Miracle, a Christmas cocktail pop-up bar in New York's East Village.\n\n\"I was obsessed with the idea,\" he says. \"I kept saying, 'We have to do our own version.'\"\n\nMiracle was founded in 2014 by Greg Boehm, who decided to transform an unfinished space into a pop-up bar that had outrageous Christmas decorations and holiday-themed drinks.\n\nCrowds swarmed the bar. Boehm, recognizing he had a hit on his hands, then began recreating the holiday theme at other locations.\n\nBy 2016, Miracle pop-ups were operating in Greece, Montreal and Paris. Miracle now recreates its Christmas bars in more than 100 cities nationwide.\n\nSippin’ Santa, a companion pop-up to Miracle that focuses on the themes of tiki and Christmas, started in 2015. They are now partnered with 27 locations across North America for the 2019 Christmas season.\n\nGianmarco Martuscelli says fall is traditionally a busy time at Klondike Kate's, which caters to nearby University of Delaware students. The holiday seasons usually bring in locals and returning alumni.\n\nMartuscelli says he gave Manerchia the green light to create a Christmas-y setting at Kate's this year and has been pleasantly surprised by the reaction it has received.\n\nLess than 24 hours after posting a sneak peek video of The Sleigh Bar on the Klondike Kate's Facebook page, the video has been viewed more than 900 times.\n\nHANDING OVER THE KEYS:Klondike Kate's sold to Chesapeake Inn owners\n\n\"It's getting a lot of traction and comments. It's getting people in the mood for the holidays,\" Martuscelli says.\n\nManerchia began gathering Christmas decorations, lights and glassware about a month ago. He scoured Costco, Walmart, Amazon and other locations.\n\n\"I think I bought every Santa mug in the state of Delaware,\" he says of the ceramic mugs that are used for holiday-themed drinks such as Grandma's Butterscotch Latte, a boozy, $7 hot drink made with RumChata, butterscotch liqueur and whipped cream.\n\nCold cocktails like Rudolph's Red Nose Mule, $7, and a Gingerbread White Russian, $7, are served in plastic red cups that look like Santa's red jacket and black belt. Customers also can purchase $6 round, shiny 20-ounce souvenir \"jingle bell\" cups.\n\nThe Christmas decorating for The Sleigh Bar began at 6 p.m. Sunday and ended Monday at 3 a.m. Manerchia designed some elements of the restaurant to be photo opportunities for guests so they could post pictures on social media sites.\n\n\"It's all about what people want to Instagram,\" he says\n\nFor instance, one long wall in a separate room near the bar area has the lighted words Sleigh Bar and it is adorned with thousands of red, green, blue, silver and gold bows. It took 10 people three hours to attach all the bows.\n\nNearby, a life-size Nutcracker, decorated with colored lights, stands waiting for selfies.\n\nMore than 500 ornaments hang from the restaurant's ceiling, which is strung with at least 2,500 Christmas lights. Wrapped fake Christmas presents, fastened with fishing wire, hang upside down near the bar area and throughout the first-floor dining room.\n\nBar stools have Santa hat chair covers and the bar, featuring neon Santa faces and strings of giant Christmas bulbs, is wrapped all around with a candy cane swirled plastic.\n\nWhite lighted and flocked Christmas trees, red and green sparkly garland and signs like \"Santa Please Stop Here\" complete the scene.\n\nBut Martuscelli says he's most excited about the sleigh near the front door. Customers have already been climbing aboard and snapping photos.\n\n\"It's already gone beyond my expectations,\" Manerchia says as he looks around the bar and says he's planning for even more decorations next year.\n\nUpcoming holiday events at The Sleigh Bar at Klondike Kate's include an Ugly Sweater Party at 10 p.m. Dec. 5, and Brunch with Santa on Dec. 15 with two seatings. The cost for the brunch is $31.95 for adults and $17.95 for children. Call 302-737-6100.\n\nDon't wait too long to see the holiday decor. While Ebenezer Scrooge might have promised to honor Christmas in his heart the whole year, The Sleigh Bar has a shelf life. Decorations come down after New Years' Day.\n\nFor more information, go to Klondike Kate's Facebook page.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/23/wilmington-rehoboth-beach-christmas-bars-holiday-beer-drinks/69652951007/", "title": "Delaware has six new Christmas pop-up bars.

People, pets, local businesses, and now … wooden posts at the beach.\n\nSanta hats recently have appeared on beach posts at Rehoboth Beach, spreading a bit of holiday magic to anyone braving a brisk walk on the sand these days.\n\nThe hats are visible now on wooden posts on the beach between Brooklyn Avenue and Laurel Street and have become somewhat of a tradition to residents, according to a Reddit post that was shared on Sunday, Dec. 3.\n\nThe holiday season is here, and if you are still stuck on what to get that hyper-specific person in your life, there’s no need to panic.\n\nMaybe they have eclectic taste or they have a singular interest different from your own.

No, the year has belonged to one character — 2023 is the Year of Grimace.\n\nFirst, there was the Grimace Shakes. Then came the Grimace Crocs. Then came Grimace at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nNow, McDonald's is launching the Grimace ugly sweater for Christmas.\n\nWhether the count down to the big day means you’ll be cramming in all your favorite holiday films or you’re just craving a nostalgic watch party, there are plenty of Christmas flicks to go around.\n\nTo give you more time to enjoy your holiday favorites instead of switching between every streaming service trying to find them, here’s a list of 23 Christmas movies and where you can stream them this year, including Christmas classics, kid-friendly holiday films and the Christmas-adjacent.\n\nOh, and there’s also some holiday horror in store if that’s your vibe.\n\nIt’s time to turn on the Christmas movies, but instead of watching them in your living room, how about opting for the big screen and some movie theater treats?\n\nIf you’re eager to see the adorable Cindy Lou Who or have been waiting all year to follow the shenanigans of Buddy the Elf, the wait is over. Regal Cinemas is re-releasing four classic Christmas movies in theaters this year.\n\nThrough Dec. 23, Regal theaters will offer screenings on select dates of “The Polar Express”; “The Grinch (2018)”; “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation\"; and \"Elf,” which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.\n\nWhether your Christmas tree went up over Thanksgiving weekend or is set to be chopped down soon, make sure you’re not unintentionally harboring a fire hazard in your home.\n\nPutting up the Christmas tree and decorating your home for the holidays is typically the official start of the season of giving for many — hanging stockings on the mantlepiece, lighting candles in the kitchen, adorning every inch of your space with holiday cheer.\n\nBut however you decide to deck out your personal winter wonderland, many elements of your holiday décor — from power strips to burnt out light bulbs to your prized Christmas tree — come with safety risks that you might be overlooking.\n\nMore than 115 million Americans are predicted to travel 50 miles or more between Christmas and New Year's this year, marking the second-busiest year since AAA began tracking holiday travel, the organization said Monday.\n\nThe expected 115.2 million travelers are expected to traverse by plane, train, car, bus and cruise ship, about 2.2% more than last year, AAA said. The busiest year for travel was 2019, when 119 million people left their homes.\n\n“This year-end holiday forecast, with an additional 2.5 million travelers compared to last year, mirrors what AAA Travel has been observing throughout 2023,” said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel. “More Americans are investing in travel, despite the cost, to make memories with loved ones and experience new places.”\n\nHouse tours traditionally kick off the holiday season.\n\nHere's where to find them plus lots of photos of house tours around the region.\n\nThe calendar is turning over to December and it's time for chain restaurants across the country to move from pumpkin spice to peppermint.\n\nHere's a look at what franchises are doing for the holidays or winter.\n\nAs we embark on another holiday season, we are thrilled to present the cherished tradition that is Yuletide at Winterthur. We are thankful that this annual celebration has become a beloved fixture for families throughout the region, a testament to the enduring charm of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library.\n\nAt the heart of Yuletide is a commitment to honoring the rich tapestry of traditions woven by Winterthur founder Henry Francis du Pont and his family, while also embracing the innovative spirit of our dedicated team. Each year, we strive to weave together the timeless allure of the past with contemporary influences, ensuring that our guests not only relish familiar holiday rituals but also discover modern touches to appreciate.\n\nThe magic of the holiday season is full steam ahead at the Brandywine Museum of Art with the ever-popular return of our beloved Brandywine Railroad model train display, along with a variety of special exhibitions and events for the whole family to enjoy.\n\nKwanzaa celebrations begin in late December.\n\nWhether you’re a longtime observer of the holiday or just wondering what Kwanzaa is about, here’s everything you need to know about the holiday.\n\nPaging all Delaware Clark Griswolds.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal is launching an initiative to help our community find the best holiday light displays, while also helping the Food Bank of Delaware.\n\nResidents and businesses can submit their over-the-top light displays to be added to a map for a donation to the food bank. All of the money donated will go directly to the Food Bank of Delaware.\n\nSubmit your spectacular display today! To fill out the form, you can use this link.\n\nThe holiday season will be in full swing soon, which means it’s time to see Santa Claus.\n\nWhether you’re hoping to round up the family for a holiday photo for Christmas cards or just want the kids (and pets!) to sit on Santa’s lap and share their wish lists, there are several places in Delaware to find Santa this year.\n\nAnd some added holiday fun to be had, too.\n\nIt's almost time to bust out the mittens, long coat and hot chocolate in preparation for chill holiday parades in Delaware and the surrounding states.\n\nNo matter where you live in the First State, we've rounded up parades in all three counties that you can check out.\n\nOnce Black Friday is behind us, the next big holiday purchase is quickly approaching: Christmas trees.\n\nNationwide, the Christmas tree industry is changing. Drought and disease have led to a shortage of tall pines and Douglas firs that tend to be a favorite of Christmas-celebrating families, and inflation may spike the prices of the trees, depending on where you shop.\n\nLuckily, Delaware is home to dozens of local Christmas tree farmers and suppliers, some that have been in operation for decades.\n\nHere's what to know about the Christmas tree industry in Delaware, and your guide to tree shopping this season.\n\nIn between watching another marathon of \"A Christmas Story\" there's a sleigh full of holiday-themed concerts and theater events you can enjoy in Delaware.\n\nHere are some festive First State events that you can paint the town red and green with this winter season.\n\nWalking around the neighborhood or driving to places and enjoying the holiday lights is always a fun pastime, but how about putting a twist on the tradition by taking the train to see holiday decorations?\n\nIf this sounds like your version of holiday fun, the Wilmington & Western Railroad in Prices Corner has a winter event you won’t want to miss this year.\n\nIf your New Year's resolution was to stop Christmas shopping at the last minute — you've come to the right place.\n\nPart of the stress of holiday shopping is feeling like your gift isn't special enough.\n\nThat's why we've spotlighted a number of craft fairs in Delaware where you should be able to find unique presents that aren't available at every major box store.\n\nOf course, some of these craft shows also are good for procrastinating shoppers, too.\n\n'Tis the season for holiday light shows, a favorite tradition amongst many who celebrate.\n\nHoliday light shows and displays are taking place across Delaware and the Philadelphia region this holiday season, so don't miss out.\n\nHere are some of the holiday shows, and where to enjoy the festive magic this year.\n\nThe hugely popular Christmas extravaganza that is Schellville is now open in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nSchell Brothers, a homebuilding company ubiquitous to the Delaware beaches, is in its sixth year of hosting Schellville. It's a 5.5-acre Christmas village full of everything anyone looking to indulge in the Christmas spirit could hope for - and it's free.\n\n\"It's like a Christmas playground for everyone,\" Schell Brothers' spokesperson Alyssa Titus says in a promotional video.\n\nAfter the success of the first Gift of Lights display near Dover Motor Speedway last year, the organizers are planning to repeat the family treat starting Thanksgiving evening, Nov. 23, through Dec. 31.\n\nIn 2022, more than 10,000 vehicles toured the site, and more than 10,000 pounds of food donations were collected for the Food Bank of Delaware.\n\nLongwood Gardens is officially back with its new holiday exhibit.\n\nThe premier public garden returns with its annual display “A Longwood Christmas,” which runs Friday, Nov. 17, through Sunday, Jan. 7.\n\nThe exhibit, which features over half a million lights, is on view every day. Yes, it's open even on Christmas Day.\n\nHere's a peek at this year's nostalgic display.\n\nThe Christmas Village is open in Philadelphia, bringing with it dozens of vendors, thousands of lights and an untold amount of good cheer.\n\nThe spectacle of holiday sights, sounds and shopping in Center City returned on Saturday, Nov. 18, and runs through Christmas Eve.\n\nChristmas Village in LOVE Park is an outside holiday festival, modeled after traditional Christmas markets in Germany, and has been a staple of the city's holiday offerings for years now.\n\n“A Christmas Story,” a beloved holiday classic, is back in theaters this year in honor of the film’s 40th anniversary.\n\nBob Clark’s “A Christmas Story” debuted on Nov. 18, 1983, and follows 9-year-old Ralphie Parker and his antics through the holidays in 1940s Cleveland, Ohio, including dodging a bully, longing for a Red Ryder model air rifle and navigating the juxtaposition of his coddling mother and cranky father.\n\n“A Christmas Story” will be re-released in theaters this December in partnership with Fathom Events and Warner Bros. to celebrate 40 years of the film. Screenings will be held on Sunday, Dec. 10 and Wednesday, Dec. 13.\n\nFor those born much too late to see the movie in theaters during its initial release, or longtime fans who have always wished to watch it on the big screen, your time has finally come.\n\nAll Philadelphia Eagles fans know the Eagles are putting together a new Christmas album – \"A Philly Special Christmas Special.\"\n\nHowever, it was announced on Wednesday's \"New Heights\" podcast that Eagles center Jason Kelce and his brother, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, have dropped a new song for \"A Philly Special Christmas Special.\" The brothers are singing \"The Fairytale of Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"I can't wait for everyone to chop me down and make fun of the way I sing,\" Travis said on \"New Heights.\" \"This will be fantastic.\n\n\"Everyone can hear me sing like a little church boy.\"\n\nBefore you stock up on Christmas cookies, cakes or other goodies, you may wonder how clean is that busy bakery and how well does it adhere to health and safety guidelines?\n\nNow you can search an easy-to-read Delaware Online restaurant inspection database that shows recent reports from food establishments in all three counties, as well as violations. That includes bakeries.\n\nSometimes we say winter has arrived when the temperatures get very low, and other times we say it’s winter as soon as the holidays hit.\n\nDespite plenty of advertisements for a “winter wonderland” here or a “winter sale” there, here’s what you need to know about the real first day of winter and the winter solstice.\n\nReady for some \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" while you battle traffic home from work?\n\nOr maybe it's \"O, Holy Night\" as you're whippin' up tonight's meatloaf.\n\nIf all you want for Christmas is some holiday hits, radio stations — terrestrial, online or satellite — are already queuing them up.\n\nThe holiday season is a great time to give back to the community.\n\nOne easy way to help out is by donating to food banks and pantries. But sometimes, what we may think is helping is not necessarily the best way to provide support.\n\nHere are some common myths about donating and volunteering with food banks and pantries − and whether or not they should be believed, according to representatives from local organizations.\n\nThe envelope had been opened by the time the card reached the house.\n\nIt was clear, based on the way the glue stuck to both sides of the envelope, that the white paper was sealed at one point. Yet somewhere on its way to Talleyville, someone had tampered with the mail.\n\nThe sender of this particular greeting card hadn’t included cash or a check, but whoever opened the card didn’t know that. They likely only saw the colorful “Happy Birthday” through the thin envelope and thought they might get lucky.\n\nWhile their snooping didn’t pay off this time, grinches will certainly be looking for money or gift cards to steal this holiday season.\n\nFirst Starbucks announced their holiday cups were out.\n\nYou knew it wouldn't be long until they released their holiday drink menu. Well, they dropped Thursday.\n\nDid you know if you’re visiting Wilmington downtown and Riverfront districts during the holiday season you can take advantage of free parking?\n\nDelaware’s largest city kicks off the holidays with Small Business Saturday and the Wilmington Jaycees’ 59th annual Christmas Parade on Saturday, which will also offer free parking for those who attend.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2024/11/13/starbucks-dunkin-wawa-holiday-menus-are-here/76229855007/", "title": "Starbucks, Dunkin', Wawa holiday menus are here.", "text": "The flavors of the season are here!\n\nPeppermint mochas, Caramel Brûlé Latte, Cookie Butter Cold Brew ... if a coffee chain can think it up, you're going to see it on a holiday menu.\n\nHere's a look at what your favorite chain is doing for the holidays.\n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks is going big into the cranberry world for the holidays with Starbucks Refreshers.

Others sat toward the back of the restaurant, enjoying mounds of fluffy orange rice, rotisserie chicken and the deliciously sweet homemade passion fruit juice.\n\nIt was lunchtime at Dominican Café.\n\nThe establishment has been in Gómez’s family for more than 40 years – being passed down from her uncle and aunt to her father and, finally, to her. While only taking up a sliver of the neighborhood, the multigenerational eatery has become a cornerstone of the West Fourth Street corridor and the Hilltop community in Wilmington.\n\nOver the years, the café has become deeply entrenched with the neighborhood and its patrons – representing more than a restaurant for some.\n\n“It's life,” said Iz Balleto, community advocate and longtime regular at Dominican Café. “No matter what time of the day you show up to Dominican Café, there's life going on in there and that's what everybody loves.”\n\nThis life can be felt in the conversations held across the counter where a weathered and creased menu is taped on display. As more people begin to file in, a hum of chatter and off-handed chuckles can begin to be heard.\n\nCustomers have become regulars and children have become adults, returning to the restaurant they enjoyed with their family years prior. Gómez has seen these generations of families cycle through her restaurant and nourish themselves on the same dishes that her parents made.\n\nTaking it to the street:Sidewalk dining and alfresco pop-up restaurants on tap\n\nGómez and her staff have come to know the catalog of regulars – and their orders. As a man makes it to the front of the line, he is greeted with his request before he can speak.\n\n“Coffee, right?” asked the cashier.\n\nThen, as the man nodded in response, Gómez tapped the cashier on the shoulder. \"Two sugars,\" she reminded her.\n\nGómez, now a mother of two, has been helping with the restaurant since 2000 when her father bought it from her aunt and uncle. Before migrating to the U.S. with his family in 1994, Gómez’s father, Andres, owned a grocery store in the Dominican Republic.\n\nDuring college, Gómez would spend all of her free time helping her parents run the business. Then, in 2005, she bought the café – a mostly symbolic change, given that she had already been performing the duties of an owner.\n\n“I took care of the business the same way when my dad was the owner as when I was the owner,” she said. “It was always the same appreciation and the same gratitude with the customers and the job.”\n\nIn 2011, Gómez sold the business back to her father in order to try and start another restaurant by herself while still helping manage the café. After a 10-year hiatus, she returned as owner of the restaurant this year.\n\nDespite the changes in ownership, Dominican Café has retained its signature food, prices and hours for more than 20 years, keeping its doors open seven days a week. Even on landmark holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, its doors are open.\n\n“As a person who's been living in the city of Wilmington for about 20 years now, I've never known them to shut their doors,” Balleto said. “That's important to the community.”\n\nIt was only last March that the restaurant had to shut down for three months due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. The closure was intended, in part, to help protect some of the older members of the staff, as well as Gómez’s parents, who would often help cook when they visited.\n\nCOVID-19:Delaware restaurants still struggling from COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDespite their efforts, Gómez’s mother, Aurelinda, would often cook extra food and sneak out of the back of the restaurant and through the alleyway to give it to regular customers who she would call to pick it up.\n\n“We would look at the camera and say, ‘This woman is crazy,’” Gómez said. “But there was no one who could take that away from her. That’s just the way she is – very generous.”\n\nWith the help of community organizations, the restaurant also provided food to hospitals and churches as the pandemic worsened – further sewing them into the fabric of the community.\n\n“I want people to realize that when you're going down Fourth Street, who kept feeding the people,” Balleto asked. “Love and respect to Dominican Café for always being there for the people.”\n\nToday, Gómez continues to provide affordable fare to the majority-Hispanic neighborhood that houses a variety of residents from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Mexico. In an effort to cater to the different customs and tastes, Gómez has put a slightly different twist on traditional Latin American dishes.\n\nFOOD TRUCK:The multitasking perseverance of 'the neighborhood crab lady' and her new Wilmington food truck\n\nOne such dish is their tripe soup, or sopa de mondongo, a popular dish in Latin America that is served in a variety of ways, depending on what country you’re in. In the Dominican Republic, for example, it’s often served in a thicker fashion with a tomato paste base. In Puerto Rico, however, it’s served in a more soup-like fashion.\n\nAt Dominican Café, Gómez finds a middle ground.\n\n“It’s not like in Puerto Rico but it’s also not like in the Dominican Republic,” she said. “It’s a combination, but lots of people like our style of making it.”\n\nThis combination of styles and cultures has found its way into other dishes on the menu. Their Cuban sandwich now comes with avocado and their signature French toast is made with vanilla imported from the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn the future, Gómez hopes to open a second location in Middletown while keeping the food, affordability, culture and historic feel of the restaurant the same. Her 17-year-old son has even offered to take the reins once she chooses to retire, continuing the tradition and keeping the café in her family.\n\nFor Gómez, the establishment represents more than a business.\n\n“It’s home,” she said. “It’s always going to be my home.”\n\nFor regulars, the eatery has grown to become more than a restaurant, providing a sense of life and belonging where the doors will always be open and a seat free. It’s a place where everyone knows your name – and your order.\n\nDominican Café is located at 1223 W. Fourth St. in Wilmington and is open seven days a week.\n\nContact the reporter at jcastaneda1@delawareonline.com or connect with him on Twitter @joseicastaneda.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2024/10/05/what-you-need-to-know-to-celebrate-halloween-2024-in-delaware/75518714007/", "title": "Halloween 2024 in Delaware: Costumes, events, food and more", "text": "Halloween is making a statement everywhere right now.\n\nEnd caps of grocery stores overflow with bags of candy corn and mini chocolate bars.

The nation’s largest shopping and entertainment center – a 5.6-million-square-foot behemoth – would open its doors for Black Friday in 150 minutes.\n\nFrigid temperatures be damned, these early birds and the tens of thousands more that would follow in the coming hours showed that the Black Friday spirit still reigns supreme in some places.\n\n“The holidays are our version of the Super Bowl,” said Jill Renslow, the executive vice president of business development and marketing at Mall of America.\n\nShoppers take photos with Santa Claus at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. The first 4,000 people in line for Black Friday were eligible for a special scratch-off giveaway contest. People enter the Mall of America to shop on Black Friday. A shopper carries a Nintendo-themed Lego set through the mall.\n\nBlack Friday serves as the kickoff of the holiday shopping season here, ever since mall officials decided seven years ago to close on Thanksgiving Day. At the time, “holiday creep” was becoming more pronounced with the emergence of “Gray Thursday,” when Black Friday-like deals and super-early opening hours landed on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThis year’s holiday kickoff holds particular significance for the mall, which is not only celebrating its 30th anniversary but a return to a pre-pandemic level of operation.\n\n“[Shoppers] want to specifically shop Black Friday, but they want to shop brick-and-mortar,” Renslow said. “They want to be able to have the immediacy to be able to bring that item home – especially if there’s something specific on their list.”\n\nAbout 100,000 people per day come through the mall’s doors, but it’s typically double that on Black Friday. In some years – notably 2018 and 2019 – that traffic totaled close to 250,000.\n\nFoot traffic has been better this year than in 2021 but still remains softer than pre-pandemic 2019, likely due to a drop in international travel, Renslow said.\n\nStill, sales are up by 9% from last year and by 5% over 2019, she said. (Those numbers are not adjusted for inflation.)\n\nThe Mall of America is the nation's largest shopping and entertainment center. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nShoppers walk through the mall during the day. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nHowever, plenty of uncertainty clouds the nation’s entire holiday season, said Jadrian Wooten, a collegiate associate professor in Virginia Tech’s Department of Economics.\n\n“This particular year is going to be a real test of the traditional Black Friday shopping mall experience,” he said.\n\nDecades-high inflation and increasing economic uncertainty continue to weigh on consumers, making them even more deal-conscious and thrifty.\n\nThat’s certainly true for public school teacher Molly Timmerman. The mother of two said she’s planning to spend “much, much less” this year than in years past. “I’m pretty worried about the economy,” she said.\n\nTimmerman plans to take a very deliberate and minimalistic approach to shopping this year, seeking out deals with her 13- and 10-year-old daughters. More importantly, though, she wants to enjoy her time with them at the shopping and entertainment center she first visited as an 8th grader the year it opened.\n\nMolly Timmerman shops with her 10-year-old daughter, Erin. The mother of two said she is worried about the economy and trying to be very intentional with her spending this season. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nThe 30th Black Friday at the ‘megamall’\n\nThe Mall of America was America’s brand-new “megamall,” hosting its first-ever Black Friday on November 27, 1992.\n\nAn estimated 170,000 people flocked to the three-story monolith that day, which dwarfed the site’s previous occupant, Metropolitan Stadium, where the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings played for 21 years. At 78 acres, the mall could hold 59 football fields.\n\nBlack Friday patrons came from far and wide that year, with many locals playing host to out-of-town guests curious to see the colossal commercial and entertainment center, according to newspaper reports at the time.\n\nThose guests were greeted by an explosion of Christmas trimmings that took 30 people three weeks to install, including 1,300 mega-wreaths featuring Snoopy, the cartoon beagle from the ‘Peanuts’ comic strip. At the time, the premier attraction at the center of the mall was the Knott’s Camp Snoopy amusement park.\n\nFamilies enjoy the Nickelodeon Universe theme park inside the mall. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nChildren play at the mall's Lego store. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nRetailers then were hopeful for a bountiful Black Friday, a return to better times as the nation recovered from the early 1990s recession. And while the foot traffic was ultimately below expectations, shoppers still scooped up plenty of deals and kept cash registers buzzing.\n\n“By 11 a.m., we had already sold what we would in a normal weekend,” Abercrombie & Fitch store manager Hilary Werner told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune at the time.\n\nThirty years later, business was again brisk at Abercrombie & Fitch. Shoppers packed around the shelves and picked through the sweaters and pants, including what the store described as “‘90s-style” ultra high-rise jeans.\n\nFollowing an expansion in 2015, the mall is now even bigger, with an additional floor and an expanded footprint to more than 96 acres (or about 13 more football fields, for those keeping count). Nickelodeon Universe, the massive indoor amusement park and its sprawling bright orange and green roller coasters, has replaced the Peanuts gang at the mall’s core.\n\nA Black Friday sale sign hangs in a store window. A shopper takes a break next to a giant nutcracker decoration.\n\nDecking the halls 30 years later are loads of larger-than-life snowflakes, ornaments and trees. Down the west corridor, strands of white lights drip from the ceiling.\n\nWith the backdrop of Christmas music playing from speakers (including multiple rounds of Mariah Carey’s 1994 mega-holiday hit, “All I Want for Christmas is You”), and amid the wafting aroma of Wetzel’s Pretzels and Cinnabon dough, shoppers loaded up with bags after hitting sales that ranged from 20% to 70% off.\n\nThe pre-dawn early birds\n\nOn Friday morning, deals served as the primary lure for many of the Mall of America early birds, some who flocked to the mall on Thanksgiving Day to be one of the first 200 shoppers to receive a gift card and first 4,000 shoppers to receive a scratch ticket offering mystery gifts and promotions.\n\nPeople line up outside the mall before it opened on Black Friday. Jamie Kelter Davis for CNN\n\nFirst in line were the Rands family from Rochester, Minnesota. The family of six arrived at 4 p.m. on Thursday and camped out overnight with “tons of blankets,” they said.\n\nCrystal Rands, 40, grew up in Mississippi going out to Black Fridays with her mom and has carried on the tradition with her family. Online shopping may be convenient, she said, but “I still like the rush and being around people.”\n\nHer family has socked away money throughout the year so they and their four children could enjoy the experience\n\nNewlyweds Alex and Sierra Weber drove five hours from Rockford, Illinois. While some families come prepared with elaborate battle plans for their power-shopping, the Webers just wanted to see what catches their eye.\n\n“We find what we find, and if we don’t find anything, we eat food and enjoy the attractions,” said Alex Weber, 33.\n\nThe Rands family from Rochester, Minnesota, were first in line. They arrived at 4 p.m. on Thursday. Jordan Zabel and Mandy Schoultz camped out overnight in an ice fishing tent. Newlyweds Alex and Sierra Weber made a five-hour trip from Rockford, Illinois. Hundreds of people were lined up outside of the mall before it opened.\n\nFurther down the line, Jordan Zabel, 28, and cousin, Mandi Schoultz, 31, popped out of their Eskimo QuickFish pop-up ice fishing shelter, where they played card games and watched “Wednesday” on Netflix.\n\nChristmas this year will be a bit pared down from past holiday shopping seasons. “I’m definitely spending less on what I can,” Schoultz said.\n\nBrooklyn Park resident Devon Shepherd, 18, bundled up and bouncing up and down to fight off the 28-degree air, let out a big smile when asked about his Black Friday plans.\n\nThe opportunity to get a gift card enticed him and his friend Esi Adamaley, also 18, to the early morning line, despite the temperature.\n\nBut while Christmas shopping may have been the impetus for their 1:45 a.m. arrival, by 5:45 a.m., Shepherd was even buzzier about the experience.\n\n“Originally, it was going to just be Christmas shopping, but now it’s the experience,” he said. “I’m still going in there and shopping ‘til I drop.”\n\nKids sit on the floor to eat lunch as tables fill up at the mall's packed food court.

Nance, a co-founder of Sistas in Prison Reform, which advocates for free prison communication and criminal justice reform, said she and her son weren't able to see her fiancé on Thanksgiving this year. She's worried she could be turned away on Christmas, too.\n\n\"For the past four Christmases while he's been incarcerated, it's definitely [been] a difficult time and can get expensive, and to try to travel there to see him can be expensive and time consuming,\" said Nance. \"But obviously during the holiday season, you want to be there as much as possible and try to get in as many phone calls or video visits as possible, but obviously that can definitely add up.\"\n\nNance is one of the many family members and friends of the more than 1.2 million people who are incarcerated in the United States who spend hundreds of dollars each month and navigate a confusing system of increasing restrictions to visit, communicate with and support their loved ones.\n\nThough many organizations work to help people in prisons connect with the outside world during the holiday season, people who were incarcerated – or have loved ones who are – told USA TODAY this time of year can be particularly difficult for their mental health.\n\n\"The holidays are a horrible time for all of us, for those who are incarcerated and also for the family members, because it's like you grieve,\" said Sharon McKinney, executive director of the Texas Inmate Families Association.\n\nVisiting can be even more difficult during the holidays\n\nResearch has shown regular contact with family members improves the mental health of incarcerated people and their family members, makes facilities safer and reduces the likelihood people will reoffend when they leave prison, according to Kirstin Cornnell, family and community support director at the Pennsylvania Prison Society. A 2011 study from the Minnesota Department of Corrections, for example, found a reduction in inmates reoffending when staff allowed increased visits and contact with family members.\n\nDespite the reported benefits, Cornnell said when visiting resumed in Pennsylvania prisons after a pause during the onset of the pandemic, new barriers were in place, including fewer and shorter in-person visiting slots, registration required in advance and reduced transportation services to prisons, which can be several hours away from major cities. Cornnell said her organization still fields dozens of calls each week from families struggling to navigate the system, calling it a \"lottery that's really hard to win, essentially.\"\n\n\"People are really struggling to be able to see their loved ones, but it's even harder on the holidays because that's when everybody is trying to see their loved one and time is limited,\" she said.\n\nIn-person visits fell from more than 200,000 in 2018 and 2019 to around 86,000 in 2021 and about 90,000 in 2022, according to Maria A. Bivens, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Bivens disputed Cornnell's characterization of the changes to visitation, saying the pre-scheduling system allows for better planning and ensures loved ones get their visit. She added that free \"video visits\" have become \"unquestionably popular\" and allowed the department to \"facilitate significantly more visits than prior to the pandemic.\"\n\nIn Texas, the state's Department of Criminal Justice had to suspend visitation on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays due to persistent staffing issues, according to Amanda Hernandez, the department's director of communications.\n\nMcKinney, of the Texas Inmate Families Association, said visitation spots fill up quickly and may be even more challenging to schedule during the holiday season.\n\n\"I have seen people on our Facebook page go for months without being able to get a visitation spot,\" she said.\n\nShe added video visits are not comparable to seeing loved ones in person.\n\n\"You don't have that human interaction,\" she said. \"You don't have that touch.\"\n\nDespite progress, cost of phone calls is still 'egregious'\n\nAbout a decade ago, phone calls to prisons and jails frequently cost more than $1 a minute, according to Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for nonprofit criminal justice research organization Prison Policy Initiative. The costs rose because private telecommunications companies monopolized the industry, and prison officials would often contract with them based on the commission payments companies offered them, Bertram said.\n\nAfter years of advocacy work, Bertram said the Federal Communications Commission, state legislatures and utilities boards have stepped in to better regulate costs.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Bureau of Prisons began offering inmates about 500 minutes of phone calls for free. States including Connecticut, California, Colorado, Minnesota and Massachusetts have also since made phone calls free, according to Bianca Tylek, executive director of the criminal justice advocacy group Worth Rises.\n\nTylek said about a dozen more states are considering legislation that would make phone calls free, and legislation signed by President Joe Biden in January gave the FCC more authority to limit fees on audio and video calls inside corrections facilities.\n\nStill, Tylek said families are \"spending egregious amounts of money to simply communicate with their loved ones.\" A 2015 survey by the Ella Baker Center found 34% of family members of incarcerated people reported going into debt to pay for phone calls and visitations.\n\nJust how much a phone call costs can vary widely depending on the location. A 15-minute phone call from an Oklahoma state prison would cost about $2.10, while the same call would cost 15 cents in Illinois, according to a 2022 report from the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nThe cost of other forms of communication can quickly add up. Denise Rock, executive director of prisoner advocacy group Florida Cares said sending an electronic message or photo costs 39 cents. Videos cost $1.60 in Florida. A 15-minute video visits costs $2.95, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\n\"It really does take advantage of people who have a loved one incarcerated and we don't say too often, but really the people that have a loved one incarcerated, they're silent victims,\" Rock said.\n\n'Rampant problems' with restrictions on mail\n\nMeanwhile, Bertram said prisons are also increasing a number of restrictions on physical mail in what officials say is an attempt to reduce contraband. Last December, the Prison Policy Initiative found at least 14 state prison systems have begun scanning mail in recent years, a number the group says is likely an undercount.\n\nBertram estimated thousands of incarcerated people will not be able to get original copies of their holiday cards this year. Instead, she said they will receive a photocopy or have to view a scan on a tablet.\n\nThere have been \"rampant problems\" with the quality of scanned mail around the country, including letters being cut off and messages becoming illegible, according to Jesse Lerner-Kinglake, communications director for Just Detention International.\n\n\"During the holidays, it really comes to the fore just the pointlessness and the cruelty of these sorts of policies,\" he said.\n\nHow you can help inmates and their families this holiday season\n\nDespite the increasing challenges, advocacy groups like Just Detention International have been working to help people in prison stay connected to the outside world during the holiday season. Each year, Lerner-Kinglake's organization sends holiday messages to incarcerated people who have experienced sexual abuse. Lerner-Kinglake said those wishing to participate this year can send a message online or have blank cards sent to them. Last year, the group sent more 28,000 cards to facilities nationwide, he said.\n\nJohanna Mills, who became a program associate at Just Detention International after being released from prison in 2019, said the cards were a crucial lifeline for her when she was incarcerated.\n\n\"Receiving cards from people who support us and from JDI was such a gift. It's like receiving things from family,\" said Mills. \"It got me through the holidays and definitely gave me the strength for yet another day of fighting for my freedom and for safety.\"\n\nIncarcerated parents around the country can also select gifts for their children through Prison Fellowship's Angel Tree Christmas program. The group partners with local churches, which purchase and deliver the gifts, according to Michelle Payette, the program's leader. Payette said more than 250,000 children will receive a gift through the program this year.\n\nPayette said when she was incarcerated more than a decade ago in a New York prison, participating in the Angel Tree Christmas program \"completely transformed\" her life. She said her son still has a Yankees fleece blanket she picked out for him one year.\n\n\"He actually received a better gift than my present that year because he was able to see that people can make mistakes and they can recover from them and that good can come out of every bad situation if we allow it,\" she said. \"We broke some cycles of family dysfunction in my life thanks to Prison Fellowship Program and other volunteers coming in other organizations.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/economy/railroad-strike-holidays-economic-impact/index.html", "title": "A rail strike won't screw up your holidays. Here's how it'll affect you in ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSo once again the nation and its economy is facing the risk of a massive freight railroad strike, this one as soon as Dec. 9. But about the only thing you don’t need to worry about it is whether it will affect your holiday shopping plans. (It won’t.)\n\nA prolonged rail strike could create all types of shortages, from gasoline to food to automobiles, and cause a spike in the prices of all types of consumer goods. It can screw up the commutes of tens of thousands of workers who take the train to work, slow the delivery of parts and force factories to shut down. But one area that most likely won’t see immediate or severe disruptions will be Christmas.\n\n“The stuff that needs to move for the holidays has already moved by rail,” said Balaji Guntur, vice president in global consultancy Kearney’s transportation practice and a logistics veteran. The goods that retailers are counting on for the holidays are already in stores or nearby warehouses.\n\n“Christmas is not canceled,” Brian Dodge, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNN in a phone interview earlier this week. His group includes Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and dozens of other major brands.\n\nA previous strike threat in September risked causing greater problems with goods slated for holiday sales, but that strike threat was averted by an 11th-hour tentative labor deal. But that strike threat is back, worrying shippers, after rank-and-file members of four rail unions rejected the earlier tentative deals. Negotiators for the two sides are back at the table.\n\nWhile the railroads say they are hopeful of reaching new deals, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want.\n\nA strike would “would utterly upend the supply chain,” Dodge said, adding that concern among retail CEOs is “high” because of the increasing risk of a national rail strike. About 30% of the nation’s freight, when measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail, and there just isn’t enough capacity on trucks or other modes to move those goods if the railroads grind to a halt.\n\nAnd a freight rail strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. “Calculations show a first-day impact of approximately $60 million, including $30.9 million for lost freight, $3.8 million for long-term passenger rail disruption and $25 million in lost railroad industry wages,” the analysis revealed.\n\nSecond and third day strike losses would increase to $91 billion per day because of lost agricultural goods and food spoilage. The costs would escalate from there.\n\nMany people expect Congress to intervene, either to order rail workers to stay on the job or quickly return to work if there is a strike, because of such severe economic ramifications.\n\nThe unions oppose Congressional intervention, saying the risk of a strike is the only way to get the railroads, many of which reported record or near record profits last year and will do so again this year, to make meet workers’ demands for better working conditions, including sick pay policies common for most workers in other industries.\n\nBut if a strike starts, and stretches on, here’s how it could affect other sectors, and many Americans:\n\nGasoline\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines. Still, railroad tank cars are a key part of that process.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail; gasoline wouldn’t be compliant with some environmental regulations without it. But even if those regulations could be waived, the cost of a gallon of gas without ethanol would jump by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nPipelines carry most of the nation’s crude oil to refineries, but each day about 300,000 barrels move by rail, a volume that would supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries’ trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also are transported via rail, as do some lower-grade products and waste materials.\n\n“If rail cars aren’t coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,” the refineries’ trade group said earlier this fall.\n\nFood\n\nFood prices might not be as negatively affected by an early December strike date,as they would have been in September amid the fall harvest. But grain and other food products still need to move by rail.\n\nThat, coupled with low water levels on the Mississippi that have slowed barge traffic amid a Midwest drought, has the nation’s agricultural industry very worried about possible strike.\n\n“Any additional disruption of rail service would immediately impact the nation’s food and agriculture and broader supply chains,” said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. “The risk in both domestic and international markets is real.”\n\nCars\n\nDecember is a major month for auto sales. But car and truck production is currently hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips that in turn has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots. That’s why car prices are now at record highs.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of completed cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. So do many of the parts used to build vehicles, moving between suppliers and car assembly plants, and production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed. It would take time to make up for lost output, creating upward pressure on car prices.\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered right before they’re used in assembly lines — a process known as “just-in-time” delivery. Many factories depend on rail to receive those parts and supplies and then ship out them out for delivery.\n\n“We already face economic turmoil with rising costs, product shortages and high inflation. Any nationwide rail strike or shutdown will cause even more economic pain,” said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers earlier this month, adding that it’s crucial that a strike be avoided.\n\nA lengthy rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, which is what happened across the global auto industry in recent years due to the shortage of parts and computer chips.\n\nCommuting\n\nOnly the nation’s freight rail lines face a pending strike, but commuters would likely be affected, too. Many commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads and passenger railroads expect they’ll have to shut down their operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak cut service on most of its long distance trains in the days leading up to the earlier Sept. 16 strike deadline deadline. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile nationwide system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also move over freight rail lines and could not operate if a strike was called. That could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don’t normally take a train.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich Matt Egan", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/economy/railroad-strike-economic-impact/index.html", "title": "Here's how the freight rail strike could affect you | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US economy can keep running without freight trains — but not for long.\n\nThat is why the risk of the first national railroad strike in 30 years is so worrying to economists and businesses. A brief work stoppage — some previous rail strikes have lasted only hours — likely won’t cause much economic disruption.\n\nBut a prolonged walkout of a week or more will cripple the nation’s still struggling supply chain, cause widespread shutdowns and shortages, and likely further drive up prices even as inflation remains near a 40-year high.\n\n“At a week, you see real damage in the US economy,” said economist Patrick Anderson of Anderson Economic Group, which conducts impact estimates on work stoppages.\n\nIf it lasts a week, a strike will mean reduced gas production, spoiled crops, a choked off supply of new cars and empty shelves at stores over the holidays. Your commute may be snarled. And for factory workers, there could be temporary layoffs in the near future.\n\nAmerica’s railroads remain crucial for keeping the US economy running smoothly. They carry nearly 30% of the nation’s freight, measured by the distance traveled and the weight of the cargo, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And there really isn’t an alternative if the trains stop running.\n\n“Idling all 7,000 long distance daily freight trains in the US would require more than 460,000 additional long-haul trucks every day, which is not possible based on equipment availability and an existing shortage of 80,000 drivers,” said Chris Spear, CEO of the American Trucking Associations in a letter to members of Congress asking that they act to prevent a strike. “As such, any rail service disruption will create havoc in the supply chain and fuel inflationary pressures across the board.”\n\nAnderson said it is impossible to come up with a dollar estimate for the impact on the economy at this point, but he said the costs will grow geometrically the longer the strike lasts, starting out at tens of millions of dollars and growing rapidly each day.\n\n“It might only be millions, but that’s a lot if it’s your job that’s one that is being lost,” he said. “If we reach a week-long strike, we’re in uncharted territory,” he said.\n\nGasoline\n\nThe price of gas has been falling steadily for three months. But a rail strike could send prices shooting higher again due to limited supplies.\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship out most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines as well. But railroad tank cars are a key part of the process to make the gas that ends up in your tank.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail. Without ethanol, gasoline wouldn’t be compliant with some environmental regulations. But even if those regulations could be waived, the lack of ethanol could increase the cost of a gallon of gas by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nAlthough pipelines carry most crude oil to refineries, about 300,000 barrels move by rail each day, a volume that could supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries’ trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also arrive via rail, and some lower-grade products and waste materials need to be shipped out by rail.\n\n“If rail cars aren’t coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,” the refineries’ trade group said.\n\nFood\n\nThe strike would be hitting at a particularly bad time for the nation’s agricultural industry. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data show that trains account for 27% of the distance grains travel when measured by weight.\n\n“A rail stoppage on September 16 would hit right as the fall harvest accelerates in many parts of the United States,” said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. “The economic damages across the food and agricultural supply chain would be swift and severe.”\n\nThe railroads started refusing to take new shipments of grain as of Wednesday in preparation for the possible strike. If the work stoppage happens, grain operators will load what they can onto rail containers sitting in their yards. But they won’t be able to move them out or accept additional grain from farmers, who will then have limited options to sell their crops.\n\nIn recent months there have been improvements to farmers’ supply chain issues suffered during the pandemic.\n\n“The gains we’ve made in the last seven to eight months will be reversed largely if this strike happens,” said Terri Moore, spokesperson for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nIn addition, farmers preparing to plant for the fall season could see shortages of the fertilizer they need, since the railroads have already stopped accepting shipments because they are classified as hazardous materials in many cases. That could hurt future supplies of crops.\n\n“There definitely would be at least some price increase for consumers,” said Max Fisher, chief economist at the National Grain and Feed Association. “If our processing plants are not running, the food manufacturers that buy these ingredients won’t have access to them for an extended period of time. Depending on how long it would go on, we worry about scarcity — being able to actually get the food.”\n\nBeyond domestic food prices, the strike could affect global food markets, since the US is a major grain exporter. With the war in Ukraine cutting off much the grain from that country, a disruption in US supply will only make a bad situation worse.\n\nCars and trucks\n\nCar and truck production has already been hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips. That has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots, which in turn has resulted in record high car prices.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. There are nowhere near enough trucks to carry that many vehicles.\n\nIn addition, many of those parts move between suppliers and car assembly plants by rail. Production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed.\n\nEventually production would resume, but it would take some time to make up for lost output. Which means more upward pressure on car prices.\n\nConsumer goods\n\nThe snarl of container ships coming into West Coast ports is finally easing after years of backlogs and delays. And although things have gotten better, they are by no means “normal” yet.\n\nAs of Tuesday the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest, said it had 27,000 shipping containers waiting to be loaded onto trains. That’s roughly three times as many as under normal conditions. Two thirds of the current inventory of containers have been there nine or more days, when none should have been there that long.\n\n“Efficient rail operations are critical to the Port of Los Angeles,” said Gene Seroka, the port’s executive director. “With two-thirds of our cargo leaving California by rail, the supply chain and the US economy need all of us working at maximum effort.”\n\nThe peak season for imported goods heading to retailers ahead of the holiday shopping period is now. The National Retail Federation said last week it is concerned about shortages later this year if there is a rail strike.\n\n“We are in the middle of the peak import season,” said the trade group. “Any rail network disruptions this month could have long-lasting negative effects on this important selling season. Product delays and shortages are correlated with inflation.”\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered just before they are used in assembly lines — a process known as “just-in-time” deliveries. And many factories depend on rail to get those parts and supplies, as well as to ship them out.\n\n“For years now, America’s manufacturing workers have endured the effects of rapidly rising material costs and severe supply chain disruptions,” said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers. A rail strike would “devastate the movement of manufactured products that families depend on.”\n\nThe rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, as happened across the global auto industry due to the shortage of parts and computer chips brought on by the pandemic.\n\nCommuting\n\nAlthough only the nation’s freight rail lines face a pending strike, many of the nation’s commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads. As a result, many passenger railroads expect to shut down operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak already has cut service on many of its long distance trains. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also are preparing to shut much of their operations for the same reason.\n\nThat could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don’t normally take a train.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/07/22/elon-musk-jordan-peterson-interview/74506785007/", "title": "Musk says estranged child's gender-affirming care sparked fight ...", "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his estranged transgender daughter was \"killed\" by the \"woke mind virus\" after he was tricked into agreeing to gender-affirming care procedures.\n\nIn an interview with psychologist and conservative commentator Dr. Jordan Peterson, the X owner called gender-reassignment surgery \"child mutilation and sterilization.\" He then discussed his 20-year-old child Vivian Jenna Wilson, who he said underwent the procedures during the pandemic.\n\n\"I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys,\" Musk told Peterson in a Daily Wire interview during which he referred to his child by their deadname. \"This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had COVID going on, so there was a lot of confusion and I was told (Musk's child) might commit suicide.\"\n\nThe SpaceX founder claimed the process is done to children \"who are far below the age of consent\" and said he agreed with Peterson's belief that anyone who promotes the practice should go to prison.\n\n\"I was tricked into doing this,\" Musk said. \"I lost my son, essentially.

For instance, in the New York case, police had to use a sketch artist to produce an image of one of the girls because of the sect's prohibition on photos. Here are 10 things to know about the fascinating lives of these Americans, also known as the Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Amish have been in America for a long time. The first ones arrived in the early 18th century to escape religious persecution in Europe and to find land to farm. The sect arose from a late-17th century schism in the Anabaptist church by followers of Jakob Amman, a Swiss minister who believed that adherents should \"conform to the teachings of Christ and His apostles\" and \"forsake the world\" in their daily lives. The word \"Amish\" derives from his name.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch are not Dutch at all. The word Dutch is a corruption of \"Deutsch\" or German, of which they speak an ancient dialect. Because of its isolation, the language has a very different pronunciation than current German and has been influenced by the English of surrounding populations. Some Amish, notably in Indiana, speak a version closer to Swiss-German.\n\nWhere they live\n\nWith farming at the center of their lives and their population rapidly expanding due to large families, the Amish, anxious not be influenced by modern ways, are always seeking out new land away from urban areas. After initially settling in Ohio, they are nowfound in 30 states as well as Canada. Ohio has the largest Amish population, followed by Pennsylvania and Indiana.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe Amish are one of the fastest-growing population groups in America. According to the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Lancaster, Pa., their population has risen from about 5,000 in 1920 to almost 300,000 today. And much of that growth has occurred in the last three decades. The center estimates there were just 84,000 Amish in 1984, meaning the population has more than tripled during that time. The population explosion is due to a belief in large families, seen as a blessing from God. The large number of children also provide labor for their farming enterprises.\n\nWork, taxes and military service\n\nTraditionally, farming of all kinds has been at the center of Amish work life. However, in the past century, according to the Young Center, increasing numbers have become involved in business enterprises, most notably in carpentry and sales of farm products. They also form construction crews that build houses and other buildings for non-Amish and sometimes work at \"English\"-owned factories and workshops, such as those in Indiana that manufacture recreational vehicles.\n\nThey are taxed on their earnings. According to the Young Center, \"They pay all the taxes — income, property, sales, estate, corporate, school — that other people do. In fact many of them pay school taxes twice — for both public and private Amish schools.\" They do not, however, pay — or collect — Social Security, having been exempted by Congress in 1965 because the Amish viewed it as a form of commercial insurance. Instead, they believe that members of the church should care for one another's physical and material needs. In some states, according to the Young Center, the Amish have also been exempted from workers compensation for the same reason. Amish also are exempt from military service due to their belief in non-resistance, a term they prefer over pacifism. This applies not only to war, but also law-enforcement, politics and legal actions.\n\nTechnology\n\nAmish life is governed by the \"Ordnung,\" a German word for order. The rules vary from community to community. According to the Young Center, \"Most Amish groups forbid owning automobiles, tapping electricity from public utility lines, using self-propelled farm machinery, owning a television, radio, and computer, attending high school and college, joining the military, and initiating divorce.\" Photos are banned because they might cultivate personal vanity, which runs against the church's prohibition of \"hochmut,\" a word meaning pride, arrogance and/or haughtiness.\n\nAccording to the Young Center, the Amish do not consider technology evil in itself, but believe that it has the potential to bring about assimilation into the surrounding society. \"Mass media technology in particular, they fear, would introduce foreign values into their culture,\" says an article on the Young Center's website. \"By bringing greater mobility, cars would pull the community apart, eroding local ties. Horse-and-buggy transportation keeps the community anchored in its local geographical base.\" Some of the rules are seemingly contradictory — for instance, 12-volt car batteries are permitted by many communities while 120-volt electricity is not. In addition, most Amish are not permitted to drive motor vehicles but are allowed to hire outsiders — known as \"English\" — to drive them.\n\nSchooling\n\nAmish children typically only attend school through eighth grade, mostly at private schools, but about 10% in public schools, according to the Young Center. Their right to end school at age 14 was confirmed by a 1972 ruling of the United States Supreme Court. Instruction is in both English and their German dialect.\n\nDiversity\n\nThe Amish are not a single unit. There are four main groups — the Old Order, the New Order, the Beachy Amish and Amish Mennonites — with many subgroups and different rules within these categories. For instance, the Beachy Amish and Amish Mennonites often drive cars and use electricity while the others use horse-drawn buggies.\n\nDress\n\nPlainness is the governor of Amish clothing. Some groups are restricted to black and white while others allow muted colors. Buttons are frowned upon because of their potential for ostentation, and such things as Velcro and zippers are banned. Instead, clothes are fastened by pins or hook-and-eye closures. Slightly smarter clothes, such as capes, are used for religious services.\n\nDating\n\nPerhaps the most famous aspect of Amish social life is \"Rumspringa,\" which means \"running around\" in the Pennsylvania German dialect. According to the Young Center, it is the time, beginning at about age 16, when youth socialize with their friends on weekends. Rumspringa ends with marriage. Apart from introducing young men and women to one another, this period is an important time when Amish youth need to decide if they will be baptized and join the church, which usually occurs between 18 and 21, or leave the Amish community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/business/railway-labor-act-freight-railroad-strike/index.html", "title": "How an arcane 96-year-old law stopped the rail strike | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMost labor disputes never end up being debated in Congress. But thanks to a nearly century-old law that regulates labor relations only when it comes to railroads and airlines, what otherwise would be strictly an economic issue became a political one.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 as one of the very first labor laws in the nation. At that point most of the railroads already had been unionized, some all the way back to the mid-19th century. The structure was therefore set up to regulate labor negotiations between unions and management, rather than oversee organizing campaigns for new unions and additional members.\n\nBecause of the law, the House was able to vote Wednesday to impose unpopular contracts on four rail unions whose members have already rejected the terms, followed by a vote by the Senate vote late Thursday that did the same.\n\nThe measure now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. When he does, there will no longer be a chance of a Dec. 9 strike that would have shut down about 30% of the nation’s freight shipments. A prolonged strike would have caused shortage of a wide range of items, from food to gasoline to automobiles, and likely resulted in a spike in prices.\n\nA group of steam locomotives pour steam and smoke into the air in St. Paul, Minnesota in this file photo from 1925. The Railway Labor Act, passed in 1926, is the reason Congress could intervene this week to block a strike by freight railroad unions. Minnesota Historical Society/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe House also passed a law that would give the unions paid sick days, addressing the issue they said led members to reject the deals. But the efforts to pass that same measure in the Senate fell short, even though 52 of 95 senators voted for it. The measure needed 60 votes to pass the senate.\n\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, the federal agency that oversees railroad and airline labor relations is the National Mediation Board, which tries to bring the two sides together, and it set up a series of limits and cooling off periods during which unions can not strike and management can not lock out the workers. And if all those efforts fail, then Congress can step in and impose a contract under which both sides will have to operate.\n\nIn negotiations at other businesses, the workers’ ability to strike is the most powerful option unions have to achieve their goals at the bargaining table. And even the railroads admit that the law makes strikes extremely unlikely.\n\n“The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,” said Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the railroads. “And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that.”\n\nAs much as management likes the law and its limits on strikes, the unions hate it. They say it would be far easier to reach a deal that their members can support if they had the leverage of a possible strike. And they say that management, when weighing the cost of that possible strike, would realize that they have the resources needed to meet those demands without an actual work stoppage.\n\nThe four major railroads — Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe — reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three railroads they cover.\n\nIf they were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the labor law that oversees worker-management relations at most of the nation’s businesses, the unions could threaten to go on strike. But under the Railway Labor Act, management can fall back on hopes that Congress will give them the deal it wants.\n\n“This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing,” said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted against the tentative agreements reached last fall that Congress is now poised to impose on members.\n\nThe railroads deny they wanted this to end up with Congress, and they preferred to reach a deal with the unions that could be ratified by membership.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said AAR’s Jefferies.\n\nBut Biden, in his statement calling on Congress to act to impose the rejected tentative agreements on the rail workers to keep them on the job, seemed to acknowledge that there was no chance that rail management would reach a deal with the unions.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management,” he said. “They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table.”\n\nThe railroads refused to accept union demands for paid sick days. Jefferies also said the railroads would only agree to make changes in sick day rules if it was within the “framework” of the proposal put forth by a presidential panel this summer that was charged with trying to find a compromise agreement.\n\nThat means for the unions to get the sick pay they wanted, they’d have to give up some other pay or benefit in order to keep the overall economics of the package unchanged. The likelihood that Congress will impose a deal along the lines of the presidential panel’s recommendations, or the tentative agreements, means that management has little incentive to agree to union demands.\n\nThe decision to urge Congress to take action was politically difficult for Biden, who is often referred to as the most pro-union president in recent history. When he served in the Senate, Biden voted against an earlier effort to impose a contract on the rail unions to keep them on the job.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said in his statement Monday night calling for Congressional action.\n\nBut he said he couldn’t ignore the economic upheaval that a rail strike could cause, and that he had no choice but to turn to Congress and the powers it has.\n\n“In this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal,” he said.\n\nAnd he said the deals, while they weren’t everything the unions wanted, were good ones for the unions, with the biggest pay increases in more than 50 years, and some improvements in other contract terms.\n\n“On the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight unions and the companies in that industry,” Biden said. “The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”\n\nBut the unions and their allies say that it’s wrong to force members to accept a deal they rejected because it denies the workers the basic sick days they are demanding.\n\n“During the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,” said a group of a dozen Democratic senators, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year – less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.”\n\nBut only 4 of the 12 senators who issued the statement - Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - voted against imposing the unpopular contracts. The other eight who signed onto the statement - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Alex Padilla of California, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island - all joined in the 80-15 vote in favor of imposing the contracts to block the strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2022/11/21/black-friday-travel-deals/10668573002/", "title": "Black Friday travel deals to help you make the most of 2023", "text": "Black Friday deals aren't just limited to department or big box stores, or even your local Best Buy (though of course, they'll be available there, too).\n\nEven travel companies have gotten in on offering their best bargains, and with the most frugal week of the year approaching, here are some of the best deals coming up, according to this reporter's inbox.\n\nWhether it's flights, hotels or rental cars you're after, some of the biggest names in online booking have you covered.\n\nHere's what to look out for, and when you need to book to take advantage of what's on offer.\n\nAnchors away:Spend the holidays sailing on these festive cruises\n\nEnjoy your worry-free vacation: Best travel insurance policies\n\nDeals 'too good to be true':Why booking flights on third-party websites can be risky\n\nAmtrak's Auto Train sale\n\nTickets on Amtrak's Auto Train between Lorton, Virginia and Sanford, Florida are on sale through Nov. 29 for as little as $29 plus the vehicle fare, which is typically a few hundred dollars.\n\nQualifying travel from Sanford to Lorton can take place between Nov. 30 and March 23, excluding Dec. 19-Jan. 2 and Feb. 24-March 1.

It also predicts that the southern and southwestern United States will see cooler weather and drought-relieving rain. The Pacific Northwest is expected to remain relatively dry and cold through the winter, with occasional storms that could bring some rain, according to the almanac.\n\nAccording to the almanac, the lower lakes region (which includes Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse), will see \"above normal\" snowfall, with the snowiest times from late December through most of January and in mid-February. The almanac also predicts a \"colder than average\" winter, with the season's coldest temperatures expected in early and late December and from January through mid-February.\n\nOld Farmer's Almanac winter outlook for New York\n\nAccording to the almanac, here's the prediction for other parts of New York:\n\nIn Utica and Albany, both within the Northeast region, snowfall and temperatures are both expected to be \"above normal\" this winter. The snowiest stretches are expected to occur in mid-to late November, mid-December and early to mid-January. The coldest periods are predicted to occur in mid- to late November, early to mid-January and early to mid-February.\n\nboth within the Northeast region, snowfall and temperatures are both expected to be \"above normal\" this winter. The snowiest stretches are expected to occur in mid-to late November, mid-December and early to mid-January.

In Elmira, Binghamton and Ithaca , all part of the Appalachian region, winter will be colder than normal with \"above normal\" snowfall.

The snowiest spells will occur in late December, mid- to late-January and early to mid-February and the coldest stretch is expected to run from early January through mid-February. In the New York City area, which is part of the Atlantic corridor region, where both snowfall and temperatures are predicted to be \"above normal,\" with the snowiest periods expected at the end of December, in late January and mid-February. The coldest days are expected to run from late-January to mid-February.\n\nAccording to its website, the almanac makes long-range forecasts using solar science, the study of sunspots and other solar activity; climatology, the study of prevailing weather patterns; and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere.\n\n“We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity,” the website states. “Our forecasts emphasize temperature and precipitation deviations from averages, or normals. These are based on 30-year statistical averages prepared by government meteorological agencies.”\n\nThis year's forecast prediction is influenced by the El Nino, a natural climate phenomenon marked by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. When this happens, it increases the chances for warmer-than average temperatures across the northern portion of the country.\n\nLast winter, 50.4 inches of snow fell in Rochester, with the snowiest month of March tallying 20.5 inches at the Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport, according to the National Weather Service in Buffalo. The normal seasonal snowfall average is around 102 inches.\n\nRochester's snowiest season in the last two decades was in 2002-03, when 135.2 inches fell. The least snowy season in the last 20 years was this past winter, according to the Weather Service.

It considers its temperature prediction for the Northeast a miss, which was \"a reflection of how abnormal weather patterns have been.\"\n\nAccording to the Weather Service, the monthly temperature averages in Rochester last winter were between 2 and 4 degrees above normal for most of last winter.\n\nThe almanac reported its overall accuracy rate for the U.S. last winter was lower than most years.

Much of New England and New York can expect a few inches of snow from a \"fast-moving clipper system\" in mid-January; the rest of the region gets rains and a wintry mix.\n\nThe end of January will be \"a very active time,\" for the region with a big storm dropping six or more inches of snow to Delaware, Maryland and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, \"with some lighter amounts in southern New York and New England,\" Duncan said.\n\nSnow storms are predicted into March with one dropping up to 5 inches in mid-March in upstate New York and central and northern New England.\n\nThe Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin) can expect periods of wet snow and rain to begin in early November, with \"frigidly cold\" temperatures through Nov. 11. Rain and wet snow continues to Thanksgiving, with a drier forecast toward the end of the year.\n\n\"January looks like when the Big Freeze may be on for that area,\" Duncan said. With \"very, very cold\" conditions expected, \"If you can plan your trip to the Caribbean, I would go then.\"\n\nIn mid-March, a \"rapidly moving storm\" is expected to bring two to five inches of wet snow to Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and the lower peninsula of Michigan and a wintry mix to Kentucky. The first of April is also predicted to bring cold rain, sleet and wet snow to Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Ohio.\n\nThe Northwest region (Idaho, Oregon and Washington) will get plenty of showers, with wet snow beginning in early November. A stormy December may yield a possible fair, dry and cold Christmas holiday, then a fair January.\n\nBut in early February, a major storm is expected to bring heavy snow to the Bitterroot Range in eastern Idaho \"with 12 inches possible.\"\n\n\"So I think it's going to be very wet conditions,\" Duncan said. \"It obviously may not be so bad in the other states in that region.\"\n\nThe North Central states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) will get a gusty Halloween and then snow in the Rockies at the start of November. An early November storm is predicted to bring heavy snow and, after it clears very cold temperatures. After a rainy, snowy Thanksgiving more storms kick off December. But a \"generally fair, dry, very cold\" Christmas is forecast; unseasonably cold temperatures are predicted to arrive in late January.\n\n\"This is where we are saying winter feels a little bit more like winter, with the coldest temperatures of the season and average snowfall,\" Duncan said. Expect a lot of snow in February, with some generated by that storm forecast for Idaho. A mid-February snowstorm predicted in the Plains could dump heaviest in Kansas.\n\nSoutheast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) overall are expected to be \"mild and wet,\" Duncan said. \"But that doesn't mean they will escape Old Man Winter.\"\n\nA \"sharp cold front\" in mid-November could bring violent thunderstorms to Tennessee and areas south, followed by a deep freeze. Conditions return to fair and dry before a wet Thanksgiving. An early December coastal storm could bring rain, winds and \"very cold air\" plus freezing conditions into Florida. A wet Christmas follows.\n\n\"We do see some colder conditions and very cold and bitterly cold conditions ending the month (of January) in the Southeast states,\" Duncan said.\n\nCold conditions are predicted to continue into February, with a midmonth storm possibly bringing sleet and wet snow to most of the region.\n\nSouth Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and Texas are forecast to have \"mild with near to below normal precipitation,\" Duncan said.\n\nThe region is expected to get plenty of rain and wet snow in December, followed by a mostly fair January.\n\nBut the beginning of February will be \"very unsettled, with some snow, possibly … up to 6 inches\" in Texas, she said.\n\nA wet Mardi Gras could be upcoming, too, according to the Almanac.\n\nSouthwest states (Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah) are forecast to have average temperatures and precipitation, a possible break from last winter's atmospheric rivers. A dry Thanksgiving is followed by rain and snow showers and a \"fair, dry, very chilly\" Christmas season is forecast.\n\nHeavy snow in the mountains in late January could lead to storms to the east.\n\nWith colder conditions also forecast in the Southeast, and Midwest and a major storm in the Northwest at the beginning of February, \"the end of January (and) beginning of February, for most of the country, looks like something you just may want to put on the calendar,\" Duncan said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

And whether you like it or not, the 2021-2022 winter season is right around the corner.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac is predicting a \"typical winter chill\" for New England this winter, with a \"stormy\" January and \"tranquil\" February. The Farmers' Almanac has released weather predictions for more than 200 years based on solar patterns, historical weather conditions and current solar activity, the annual weather book's website says.\n\nThe almanac's \"time-tested\" winter formula awaited by many each year predicts there will be notable month-to-month variations this coming winter, but overall, snowfall will come at a \"near-normal\" amount.\n\n\"There will be snow, but probably not as much as snow-sport enthusiasts might dream of,\" the almanac says. The region — the book does not make predictions for each state — could, however, be in for a few major storms.\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac, which was founded before the Farmers' Almanac, is predicting a \"season of shivers,\" and its editor, Janice Stillman, has said it could be \"one of the longest and coldest we've seen in years.\"\n\nTough winter ahead?:Apparently, if you believe 'The Old Farmer's Almanac'\n\nWhat does the Farmers' Almanac say about winter 2021-2022 in New England?\n\nJanuary will begin with milder temperatures, according to predictions, and develop more bite as the month moves along. \"Overall, the month will be stormy, especially along the Atlantic Seaboard,\" the almanac writes, forecasting stretches of rain, snow, sleet and ice.\n\nFebruary is predicted to be much quieter. But as the month winds down, make sure to get your shovels and snowblowers ready, as a \"winter whopper\" is forecasted by the almanac for parts of the Northeast toward the end February.\n\nLooking ahead:Farmers' Almanac predicts a 'winter whopper' in February. What else is coming in 2022?\n\nThe Northeast is predicted to see three major storms – in the second week of January, the final week of February and the second week of March.\n\nHow do the Old Farmer's Almanac and Farmers' Almanac make predictions?\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac was founded in 1792 by Robert B. Thomas, and initially made predictions according to sunspots. Today, it incorporates meteorology and climatology by using solar science and activity, weather patterns and more.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, which is slightly different from the Old Farmer's Almanac and was founded in 1818, uses sunspot activity, tidal action of the moon, the position of the planets and other factors.\n\nBoth the Old Farmer's Almanac and Farmers' Almanac claim to have secret formulas. The only person who allegedly knows the exact formula of the Farmers' Almanac is its weather prognosticator who goes by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee.\n\nPublished reports have said the Farmers' Almanac takes into account climate change, while the Old Farmer's Almanac doesn't yet.\n\nAre the Farmer's Almanacs' predictions accurate?\n\nSo, how accurate are the predictions each year?\n\n\"We believe that nothing in the universe happens haphazardly, that there is a cause-and-effect pattern to all phenomena,\" the Old Farmer's Almanac wrote in an August post answering the very question. \"However, although neither we nor any other forecasters have as yet gained sufficient insights into the mysteries of the universe to predict the weather with total accuracy, our results are almost always close to our traditional claim of 80% accuracy.\"\n\nMore:Almanac says we're in for one of the coldest winters in 'years.' Should you trust it?\n\nThe accuracy rate of the Old Farmer's Almanac's forecast for last winter was lower than most years – 72.2% accurate when it came to predicting the change in temperature, and 77.8% accurate at forecasting the change in precipitation, the almanac said. For example, the almanac predicted that snow would be greater than normal in the Northeast, but the actual area was more south and consolidated, from Connecticut to Philadelphia.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac also claims an accurate rate, about 80-85%.\n\nReporting by Gannett reporters Trevor Ballantyne and Toni Caushi was used in this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/08/26/tennessee-winter-weather-outlook-prediction-farmers-almanac-nws-forecasters/74724161007/", "title": "Tennessee winter weather predictions: What Farmer's Almanac ...", "text": "Instead of a winter wonderland, Tennessee — along with the rest of the United States — is expected to experience a wet whirlwind, according to the 208th edition of the Farmers’ Almanac. The 2024-2025 winter weather outlook calls for a winter season full of rapid-fire storms that will bring both rain and snow for most regions.\n\nThe outlook predicts a cold, wet winter for most locations. Average or above normal temperatures are forecast for New England, the Northeast, the Southern Plains, the Southeast and the Atlantic Coast regions.\n\n\"It definitely looks more wet than white in many areas,\" Farmers' Almanac Editor Sandi Duncan told USA TODAY. \"Obviously, depending on where you live, there might be more white than wet, but we're focusing in on the wet winter ahead.\"\n\nHere's what lies ahead regarding winter weather.\n\nWhat does the Farmers' Almanac say about the 2024-2025 winter outlook in Tennessee?\n\nAs previously reported by USA TODAY, the Farmers' Almanac predicts that Southeast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) are expected to be \"mild and wet\" overall.\n\n\"But that doesn't mean they will escape Old Man Winter,\" added Duncan.\n\nTennessee will experience a hotter and wetter than average winter season, according to the National Weather Service\n\nAccording to the Climate Prediction Center, Tennessee will experience above average temperatures (33-40%) with parts of the Middle Tennessee region experiencing above average precipitation (33-40%) during December, January and February.\n\n\"There is still a 60-67% chance that either near normal or below normal temperatures are experienced, but our best prediction is that we'll exceed the monthly temperature averages,\" said National Weather Service Meteorologist, Ryan Husted.\n\nIn December, Nashville experiences average highs of 52, average lows of 33 and an average precipitation of 4.43 inches. In January, the area normally sees highs of 49, lows of 30 and an average precipitation of 4 inches. Then in February, things gradually begin to heat up with average high of 54, lows of 33 and an average precipitation of 4.47 inches.\n\nMost of the Southeastern United States is typically favored for above normal temperatures, due to La Niña, the periodic cooling of sea-surface temperatures, added Husted.\n\nHow will La Niña impact weather weather in Tennessee?\n\nLow pressure systems generally move north of the area during La Niña conditions, which often keeps Tennessee in the area of warmer temperatures, providing fuel for thunderstorms, said Husted.\n\nThe probabilities for the Volunteer State to experience a major winter event like snow or ice are lower, however extreme winter events can never be ruled out. For example, the winters of 2022-2023 (a La Niña winter) and 2023-2024 both experienced above normal temperatures yet they still came with a \"substantial\" cold snap, said Husted.\n\n\"We all remember these single winter events but often forget how warm the rest of the winter is,\" Husted told the Tennessean in an email. \"... We speak in general terms for the season and are unable to predict single weather events and their exact timing until they have formed and are approaching us, usually a few days away.\"\n\nWill Nashville receive snow this winter?\n\nIt is currently impossible to predict how much snow Nashville will receive this season, said Husted. Based on previous snowfall events, Music City favors normal (4.7 inches) and below normal snowfall during La Niña winters.\n\nThe winters of 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 were all La Niña winters, and they received 5.2 inches of snow (near normal), 9.5 inches of snow (above normal) and 1.2 inches of snow (below normal), respectively.\n\nHow much snow did the Nashville area receive last winter?\n\nIn January, Nashville experienced record breaking snowfall, receiving its yearly average of snow in less than 24 hours. On Tuesday, Jan. 16, the weather service confirmed Nashville's official snowfall accumulation was 7.6 inches, with the majority of it (6.3 inches) falling on Monday alone.\n\nSurrounding areas were covered under an even thicker blanket of snow. Kingston Springs, Gallatin and Hendersonville received eight inches while Belle Meade, Berry HIll and Oak Hill received nine inches.\n\nRecord snowfall in Nashville?Music City surpasses yearly average in less than 24 hours\n\nNashville's top five snowstorms:\n\nMarch 16-18, 1892: 17 inches Feb. 2-3, 1886: 16 inches Feb. 20-21, 1929: 15 inches Jan. 29-Feb. 1, 1951: 12 inches Feb. 6-9, 1979: 11 inches\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nDiana Leyva covers trending news and service journalism for The Tennessean.

The long-running Almanac more or less accurately predicted the 2021-22 winter season in Connecticut and the Northeast.\n\nHow spot on were the spring predictions? And what's it expecting for summer in New England and Connecticut?\n\nSpring predictions were off the mark\n\nThe first big prediction of spring according to the Farmers' Almanac was \"slow to warm\" temperatures marked by an unseasonably cold vernal equinox on March 20. For Connecticut, that wasn't exactly the case.\n\nTemperatures from March 13 through 31 we're higher than average, with peaks of 66, 67, and a balmy 76 degrees on March 26.\n\nThe Almanac got one thing exactly right - the sole day of the vernal equinox was a cold 37 degrees.\n\nCelebrity interviews and '60s rock:52 years on air with Norwich's 75-year-old radio host\n\nWhen it came to precipitation totals, the Almanac was close, but not quite right.\n\nConnecticut and the Northeast region was expected to receive lower than usual rainfall, with a regional outlook far drier than the rest of the United States. In actuality, this spring has been pretty average. Rainfall totals from March and April were off by less than an inch for most regions but, to the Almanac's credit, did trend just a bit drier.\n\nWhat does the Farmers' Almanac expect for summer?\n\n\"Hot, Hot, Hot,\" is the biggest prediction nationwide.\n\nPredictions for Connecticut and New England are for more \"seasonably warm\" temperatures, while the rest of the United States should be seeing temps far higher than normal.\n\nExpect a host of storms to hit the east around the summer solstice, or June 21.\n\n\"The transition from spring to summer will be stormy,\" says the Almanac.\n\nCamaraderie of craft breweries:Why do brewers work together and seek out local causes?\n\nThat aforementioned heat will hit in full come July, with many areas fielding temperatures in the 90s and triple digits.

By mid month, \"the worst should be behind us.\" Cooler weather will come by September.\n\nFinally, despite heavy storms in June, the Farmers' Almanac predicts a below average precipitation over the Northeast and Connecticut.

Last year, the Almanac predicted a cold snowy winter for the East and dry conditions for the West.\n\nBut California had nine atmospheric rivers. Tornadoes were sighted in Illinois and Iowa in January, while during that month the Northeast had record warm temps. And despite a balmy February forecast for the East, Mount Washington, New Hampshire, recorded the nation's coldest wind chill ever.\n\nThe end of La Niña, a weather phenomenon that increases cold and snow in the Northwest and dry conditions in the South, \"is one of the reasons we believe winter last year turned out warmer than normal,\" wrote the Almanac's managing editor Sandi Duncan in a statement.\n\nThe Almanac had expected a third La Niña winter, but \"by February, it had virtually collapsed. The West turned wet, and the contiguous US ended up with its 17th-warmest winter on record,\" the Farmers' Almanac said.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, which originated in 1818, says its longtime fans claim the publication's weather predictions are accurate approximately 80-85% of the time. It uses \"a top-secret mathematical and astronomical formula, taking sunspot activity, tidal action, the position of the planet, and many other factors into consideration,\" the Almanac states.\n\nFor winter 2023-2024, the Almanac takes into account the strengthening of El Niño, which should result in more moisture and storms in the southern U.S., its editors said.\n\nEl Niño is back, NOAA says:Will it help fuel Earth's hottest year on record?\n\nA graphical explanation of El Niño:It could return in 2023; what that means for the world's weather\n\nShould you trust the Farmers' Almanac?

Then, during the second week of February, \"an East Coast storm affecting the Northeast and New England states will bring snowfall, cold rain and then frigid temperatures.\" The first week of March, the Almanac forecasts, \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\" Come spring, during the third week of April, a \"possible late-season snowfall\" is expected \"over the high terrain of New England.\"\n\nGreat Lakes, Ohio Valley and Midwest\n\nForecast for Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin: January and February should bring lower than average temperatures and lots of \"snowstorms, sleet, ice (and) rain\" around the Great Lakes and Midwest, the Almanac forecasts.\n\nSoutheast\n\nForecast for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia: Florida and the rest of the Southeast \"will see a wetter-than-normal winter, with average winter temperatures overall, but a few frosts may send many shivers to snowbirds trying to avoid the cold and snow back home,\" the Almanac forecasts. In mid-February, the Southeast will experience \"unseasonably cold temperatures,\" and during the first week of March \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\"\n\nNorth Central\n\nForecast for Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming: This winter, the Great Plains and Rockies can expect \"plenty of cold temperatures and occasional bouts of storminess, bringing widespread rains and snows,\" the Almanac forecasts.

Nevertheless, the almanac asserts heavy snowstorms will hit central and southern Appalachia, the Rockies and portions of the western Ohio Valley.\n\nIndiana, writes the almanac, will have snowy, cold conditions in the southern half of the state while northern Indiana gets cold drier weather.\n\nHow do both almanac forecasts compare?\n\nBoth almanacs — the Farmer's and Old Farmer's — appear to agree with each other about Indiana's autumn and winter weather: things are looking on the cool and crispy side.\n\n\"Fall will be frosty and wet in the Great Lakes, Midwest region while the temperatures in the North Central region may be downright frigid, with lots of fall flakes and rain,\" writes the Farmer's Almanac, adding the Midwest will see a \"Big Freeze\" in winter.\n\nWhether either almanac gets it right this year remains to be seen.\n\nHow accurate are the Farmer's Almanac and Old Farmer's Almanac?\n\nDespite assertions the almanacs are 80-85% accurate, studies have shown their long-range predictions are sometimes little better than a coin flip. One study cited by Popular Mechanics reported the Farmer's Almanac was right about 52% of the time.\n\nWhat NOAA's Climate Prediction Center says about fall 2024\n\nMeteorologists with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center have offered a peek into what lies in store for Hoosiers this fall and winter. As it turns out, don't pack up your shorts and flip-flops just yet.\n\nA seasonal temperature outlook map issued Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows Indiana is leaning toward a toasty fall. Warmer than normal temperatures are favored across a majority of the country, according to NWS, partly due to the lowered seawater temperatures of La Niña. The map is valid from October to December 2024.\n\nLa Niña explained:What is La Niña? Does it bring more snow? How climate pattern could affect US weather.\n\nWhat about winter? Here's what NOAA says...\n\nMost of Indiana has equal chances for below and above average temperatures this winter from December 2024 through February 2025, according to a seasonal temperature outlook map issued Thursday by NOAA.\n\nForecasters say this year's winter could also be a wet one.\n\nThe latest seasonal precipitation outlook predicts Central Indiana will likely see above average precipitation (50-60% probability) from December through February, according to NOAA.\n\nOther weather predictions:Farmer's Almanac gives Midwest its fall, winter 2024-25 forecast, but here's what NOAA says\n\nJohn Tufts covers trending news for IndyStar and Midwest Connect.

To catch a glimpse or a photo, the publication suggests visiting Maine's Acadia National Park, New Hampshire's Kancamagus Highway or the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nHow rainy will it be this fall?\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac is predicting the eastern half of Massachusetts will see average rainfall, while the western half will see a below-average amount of rain.\n\nHow does the Old Farmer's Almanac make predictions?\n\nAccording to its website, the Old Farmer's Almanac makes its predictions by comparing solar activity with weather patterns.\n\nThe almanac says it uses multiple academic disciplines for its predictions, including solar science, climatology and meteorology.\n\nIt also says the weather forecast methodology is the modern version of a formula created by the Almanac's founder, Robert B. Thomas, in 1792.\n\nHow accurate are the Old Farmer's Almanac's predictions?\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac, which is slightly different from the Farmers' Almanac, claims an 80% accuracy rate on its predictions.\n\nIn a report analyzing the success of its predictions for last winter, the Almanac said its total accuracy rate for the season was 64%. The publication attributed the lower rate to \"abnormal recent weather patterns.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/23"}]}

The report consists of responses from 5,000 people in all 50 states, ranging from their ideal Thanksgiving crowd, the dishes they love and when dinner should be served.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nIn terms of which holiday sides reign supreme, stuffing/dressing came out on top as the No. 1 pick. Mashed potatoes, the previous holder of the top spot, came in at No. 2 this year, followed by sweet potatoes (up from No. 4 in 2023), green bean casserole (up from No. 5 in 2023) and macaroni and cheese (down from No. 3 in 2023).\n\nNeed a recipe?:Check out holiday dishes from Southern Cooking\n\nMost states, including Delaware, picked stuffing as their favorite side. Mashed potatoes were the top pick in California, Utah, Wyoming, Iowa and West Virginia.\n\nWhen it comes to regional trends, 54% of the Northeast say stuffing is their favorite side dish, making it the region’s favorite pick. Eleven percent of the Northeast include Italian dishes in their typical holiday spread. The Northeast also is characterized by a Thanksgiving table filled with the flavor profiles of sweet, savory seafood and maple syrup.\n\nOther flavor profiles include cheesy delight and savory herbs in the Midwest, sweet flavors and savory herbs in the Southeast, smoky flavors and savory herbs in the West and spicy chiles in the Southwest.\n\nJust in time for the holidays:From Carhartt to Abercrombie to wacky soap, here's what's new at Christiana Mall in 2024\n\nDelaware’s favorite, least favorite holiday dishes\n\nIn a Reddit post from 2020 featuring a map depicting each state’s favorite holiday side dish, Delawareans picked macaroni and cheese. Regional neighbor Maryland felt the same, while New Jersey and Pennsylvania both picked stuffing. Other favorites mentioned were hash brown casserole, creamed corn and side salad, much to the dismay of some commenters.\n\n“Listen, it’s cranberry sauce or it’s nothing,” commented one Reddit user. “Get out of here with this side salad garbage.”\n\nIn a 2023 TikTok from user “snachwithzach,” Delaware’s favorite Thanksgiving side dish, according to a map, is cauliflower mashed potatoes.\n\n“Way to be different Delaware. Nothing like liberty and low carbs,” said the user.\n\nAllrecipes, a recipe website, combed through data about user search patterns around Thanksgiving to figure out the most sought-after side dish in each state. Delaware’s most requested recipe was for sweet potato casserole, which also score highest in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Maryland was the only regional neighbor to hop off the bandwagon and obsessively search for corn pudding instead.\n\nWhat’s interesting about this top pick is that Delaware’s least favorite holiday dish in at least two separate years was said to be sweet potatoes, according to BroBible in 2019 and Yahoo Sports in 2023.\n\nYahoo Sports claimed sweet potatoes were the “most hated” Christmas dish for Delawareans last year. BroBible similarly claimed the dish is the “worst Thanksgiving food” according to Delawareans. Maryland and New Jersey disliked seeing cranberry sauce on the holiday table while Pennsylvania revealed a hatred of pumpkin pie.\n\nAdd your holiday decor:Delaware holiday lights: Get your house or business listed on our map\n\nFor what it’s worth, Delaware was not one of the 38 states that claimed to hate turkey.\n\nIn a 2023 Delish study about each state’s most popular Christmas dish, gingerbread cookies stole the show.\n\nIt seems like Delaware residents have quite the sweet tooth with that emerging as their most searched recipe, as the most popular holiday recipe searched by Delawareans from Taste of Home, a food magazine, is double whammy eggnog cookies.\n\nAs for Delaware’s favorite Christmas dessert, Taste of Home reports that residents of the First State can’t get enough of classic chocolate chip cookies.\n\nWhether these holiday food likes and dislikes sparked joy or outrage, it’s obvious that there are a lot of opinions about what should be on the dinner table this year.\n\nAnd it may be a sign that it’s worth checking with guests about their food preferences to avoid a holiday dinner fiasco. ... especially if you plan on bringing a side salad to the gathering.\n\nFor lots of cooking and food tips, check out Patricia Talorico's Delaware Eats newsletter.

The case of Graff is an example of dioceses that minimized the criminal conduct of one of their priests, while secretly noting the significant danger the priest posed to the public.\n\nThe grand jury notes that the use of euphemisms was constant throughout the Dioceses of Pennsylvania, but particularly apparent in the case of Graff. Terms such as \"sick leave\" or \"health leave\" were often used to reference an absence from ministry related to child sexual abuse.\n\nRichard J.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville. Upon his release on November 31, 2005,\n\nYarrosh registered with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender. Upon his release from prison, Yarrosh was still a priest. On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police.

Father John Fischer testified that he walked in on Barletta and a young high school student in private chambers, and that the student was naked from the waist down, trying to pull up his underwear and pants as Barletta watched. Fischer recalled that Monsignor Hastings dismissed the report, and that fellow priests laughed it off.\n\nLater on, Bishop Trautman recorded details of a conversation that he had with Sister Donna Markham about Barletta. Trautman wrote that Barletta abused 5 children. Barletta was confronted with allegations of oral sex, naked messages, digital anal penetration and masturbation against a victim in 1994. When confronted, Barletta admitted his guilt to Trautman. The diocese paid for the victim’s counseling, but once the victim shared the story of abuse with a newspaper, Trautman advised that the victim should seek payment directly from Barletta.\n\nFrom 1975 though 1994 when he was dismissed from Erie Cathedral Prep, Barletta admitted abusing 25 children and young men.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Trussville City Schools Superintendent Pattie Neill’s contract was scheduled to expire June 30, 2026, but her attorney renegotiated the pact that will now end Oct. 31, 2023. Neill will be paid through that date but will no longer be in charge of the district, which is in a suburb of Birmingham, al.com reports. “It provides us an opportunity to move forward; it provides us an opportunity to have a fresh start,” Trussville City Board of Education Vice President Kim DeShazo said of the negotiation involving Neill. “I am looking forward to our city being in the news for the things that we have to celebrate because Trussville City Schools does have a lot to celebrate and a lot to be thankful for ... I’m looking forward to the next chapter.” The board named Interim Superintendent Frank Costanzo as the district’s acting superintendent as the system begins the search for Neill’s permanent replacement. Since Sept. 30, Neill had been on a 60-day leave of absence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said Wednesday that he is satisfied with Alaska’s ballot counting process and that there are no plans for a statewide hand-count audit of a race like the one he called for two years ago. Meyer oversees elections in Alaska and after the 2020 general election announced plans for an audit of votes on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed. He cast the audit, conducted after the race was certified, as a way to address questions that had been raised about the validity of election results tied to vote tabulation equipment used by the state. The audit affirmed the passage of the initiative, which ended party primaries and instituted ranked-choice voting in general elections. This year’s elections were the first held under the new elections process. Meyer and Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai held a briefing with reporters Wednesday, ahead of next week’s election. Meyer said he is “satisfied that the process works and that there’s enough checks and balances in place that if something isn’t quite right, we’ll catch it soon.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Meyer said that with the 2020 review, “we were able to show folks that the machines worked correctly.” He said it has been frustrating to see people get misinformation from social media or from online videos.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A planned research center operated by the University of Arizona will get a $150million allocation of federal money via the state, officials announced Wednesday. The designation comes from money the state received through the American Rescue Plan Act, C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Gov. Doug Ducey, wrote in an email. The funds will go to the UA Health Sciences’ planned Phoenix-based Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies, which will be part of the downtown, 30-acre Phoenix Bioscience Core campus. There are no current cost estimates for the project, UA officials said Wednesday. The Phoenix Bioscience Core includes several education, health care and research entities, including the Arizona-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, the UA College of Medicine Phoenix, and the Dignity Health-Cancer Institute at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center. The Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies intends to advance immunology research in four areas: cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and real-time immune system monitoring, UA officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: Two former Crawford County deputies fired over excessive force complaints had requested a public hearing Wednesday in efforts to clear their names, but they didn’t show up, the sheriff’s office reports. Neither Levi White nor Zack King appeared at the sheriff’s department lobby Wednesday. Instead, a woman showed up to make accusations that she, too, has been roughed up during an arrest by White. White and King were caught on video making a rough arrest of Randal Worcester on Aug. 21. The video taken by a bystander showed White, King and a Mulberry police officer, Thell Riddle, beating Worcester after a convenience store clerk in Alma claimed Worcester threatened her. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith, who previously represented Worcester, said he is now represented by another attorney in Oklahoma City. Powell is now representing Tammy Nelson, who said on Aug. 21, she was at her home, where she was involved in a civil matter that resulted in a heated argument that didn’t go well. White was sent to the call, where things escalated for the worse, she said. “I was just attacked by him and violated and thrown to the ground,” Nelson said. She was arrested and jailed on complaints of obstruction of a government operation and harassment. Powell said he has heard from other clients with such complaints.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting state officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay. The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90% were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general’s office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI’s database, and nearly 800 resulted in “hits.”\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho Springs: The Colorado city of Idaho Springs said Wednesday it has agreed to pay $7 million to a 75-year-old man who said an officer used a stun gun on him without warning and dragged him from his apartment after a dispute with a neighbor, causing a stroke that left him with permanent injuries. Michael Clark alleged in the federal civil rights suit filed last year that he suffered numerous health problems after Officer Nicholas Hanning used a Taser on him in his home in Idaho Springs, causing Clark to lose consciousness, fall and strike his head. Clark also accused Hanning of putting a knee on his neck, depriving him of oxygen and increasing his risk of death. Hanning, who was fired after the May 2021 encounter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and relinquished his right to serve as a law enforcement officer in Colorado. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation and community service. The Idaho Springs statement said the city admits no liability but is settling the case “for economic reasons and to bring closure to all involved.” It did say the city and Police Chief Nate Buseck “acknowledge the poor judgment that led to the use” of the Taser against Clark, which Buseck previously described as unacceptable. “He is wheelchair bound and now forever dependent on his family and doctors to survive,” Clark’s attorney, Sarah Schielke, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A man who was linked to the sexual assaults of four women in 1984 by information on a genealogy database was convicted Wednesday of all eight kidnapping charges against him. A state jury in Hartford took less than an hour of deliberations to unanimously convict Michael Sharpe after a five-day trial. He faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 9. Sharpe, 71, who had been free on a promise to appear in court, was detained after the verdicts because a judge set a new bond at $2.5 million. At least two of the victims were in the courtroom and wept after the verdicts were announced, The Hartford Courant reports. Sharpe’s public defender, Dana Sanetti, said in her closing argument Tuesday that the only evidence connecting Sharpe to the attacks was his DNA, which was only “a piece of the puzzle,” Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Sharpe, of Marlborough, was once the chief executive officer of a group that ran the Jumoke Academy, a tuition-free charter school in Hartford. Prosecutors said he broke into the women’s homes in four different towns and sexually assaulted them at gunpoint in June and July of 1984. Investigators found DNA evidence at the homes, but no matches could be found at the time, and the cases went cold.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A big change is coming for the state’s surf-fishing car tag program: There will be no cap on the number of permits issued for 2023, according to an announcement from State Parks Director Ray Bivens on Wednesday. Yes, that means people don’t have to rush to the computer or Delaware State Parks’ gates to snag those coveted surf-fishing tags that allow drive-on beach access. No longer crushed by the “sold out” announcement from State Parks, anyone who wants a surf-fishing tag can now get one. Still, there was a reason the cap was put in place − to protect the natural resources and manage crowds. That’s where another change comes in. After a stakeholder group met this spring, State Parks announced it will be piloting a new reservation system for 36 of the busiest days during the season. The pilot reservation system and lifting of the cap come after the demand for surf-fishing permits has continued to grow in recent years and peaked at unprecedented heights in the past two years. In 2020, the maximum 17,000 tags sold out in just a few months, prompting the state to release an additional 1,000 tags. Eager anglers and beach enthusiasts lined up overnight for a chance to get one of these extra permits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Internationally renowned chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up with Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday for a friendly cooking competition at his newly opened restaurant in the nation’s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips opened Oct. 25 in The Wharf area of the city. The location is the third in the franchise, his take on the classic English street food. The menu ranges from classic fish and chips to chicken, shrimp, “dirty chips” and Gordon’s signature shakes: Sticky Toffee and Biscoff. During the competition, Bowser got to try her hand at one of the signature shakes with the help of Ramsay. The famed chef and the mayor competed against Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio and chef Christina Wilson, who won season 10 of Ramsay’s reality show “Hell’s Kitchen,” to see who could make the best Biscoff shake. The Ramsay-Bowser duo claimed victory. There could be a chance for a rematch in the future, as restaurateur Ramsay is not stopping with the Fish & Chips location in D.C. He is also opening his wildly popular Hell’s Kitchen restaurant, inspired by the show of the same name, on The Wharf as well in early 2023. Until then, the Fish & Chips location in D.C. is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday-Saturday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida State University held a memorial service on campus Wednesday evening to remember the victims of the 2018 yoga studio shooting in the city. The service marked four years since the mass shooting took place at Tallahassee Hot Yoga, where Scott Paul Beierle killed two women, 21-year-old Maura Binkley and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, and injured five other victims before killing himself. A key part of the service was the announcement of a new initiative called “Florida State United: One Voice Against Hate,” which aims to bring more awareness to hate crimes through research and education. “As Maura and Nancy exemplified in their lives, love is the most important work we can do,” Jeff Binkley, Maura Binkley’s father, said to the FSU and Tallahassee community as they were gathered near the Integration Statue on campus. “Always remember that only love can conquer hate.” Maura Binkley was a senior at FSU double majoring in German and English, and Van Vessem was a chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan, as well as a former faculty member at FSU’s College of Medicine. Signs were placed throughout the area with phrases such as “A Voice for Safety,” “A Voice for Peace” and “A Voice for Freedom.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency has stopped accepting applications from people seeking assistance with their rent payments, saying money from the federally funded aid program has begun to run out. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs posted an announcement on its website last week that the agency is no longer taking rental assistance applications, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The news caught housing advocates off guard and left some tenants scrambling to pay rent with little warning, said Lindsay Siegel, director of housing advocacy at Legal Aid of Atlanta. “The DCA put some tenants in a pretty bad position,” Siegel said. “If they knew they were running out of money, they should have told them so they could plan.” The federal government put $46.5 billion into an emergency rental assistance program in 2020 in hopes of averting spikes in evictions and homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Treasury Department reported a year ago that several states and large cities had already exhausted their share of the funding. Now Georgia is getting close to running out of rental assistance money, prompting the Department of Community Affairs to suspend applications, agency Commissioner Christopher Nunn said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The ground is still shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating it could erupt. Scientists say they don’t expect that to happen right away, but officials on the Big Island are telling residents to be prepared. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest – that title goes to Mauna Kea – but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass. It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is currently erupting from its summit crater. Kilauea is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean. Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. In written history, dating to 1843, it has erupted 33 times. The Big Island is mostly rural and is home to cattle ranches, coffee farms and beach resorts. Mauna Loa’s eruptions differ from Kilauea’s in part because it is taller. Its greater height gives it steeper slopes, which allow lava to rush down its hillsides faster than Kilauea’s. Its enormous size may allow it to store more magma, leading to larger lava flows when an eruption occurs. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has more than 60 GPS stations on Mauna Loa taking measurements to estimate the location and the amount of magma accumulating beneath the surface. There’s also a thermal webcam at Mauna Loa’s summit that will identify the presence of heat. And satellite radar can keep track of ground swelling and deflation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A high-profile attorney who has defended in state and federal courts some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is among the latest attorneys to quit state employment. Former Deputy Attorney General Megan Larrondo is one of eight attorneys and a handful of other staffers who have left or are leaving the Idaho attorney general’s office following Raúl Labrador’s win over five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the Republican primary in May. More departures are expected. Information obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows that Larrondo’s job ended Monday. Court documents filed Friday in both U.S. District Court in Idaho and the Idaho Supreme Court show filings requesting Larrondo be removed as attorney of record in the state’s abortion cases. The state and federal courts have yet to make final rulings in those cases. Labrador, a former U.S. representative who has said voters are looking for an aggressive, conservative attorney general, has promised to make the office more partisan should he win in next week’s general election. In a series of recent interviews, he denigrated attorneys working in the office, telling the Lewiston Tribune that the “Attorney General’s Office needs to have better lawyers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The 2018 killing of “ZackTV,” a trailblazer in a perilous genre of gangland reporting he called “‘hood CNN,” seemed destined to go unsolved, even though gunmen attacked him on a downtown Chicago street lined with surveillance cameras. Police never announced arrests in the shooting of Zachary Stoner, who drew a national YouTube following filling a media niche with up-close stories about the lives and deaths of gang members and affiliated rappers from places other reporters were afraid to go. But police records obtained by the Associated Press reveal investigators believe they solved his homicide years ago when they arrested members of South Side Chicago’s “Perry Avenue” gang. Yet prosecutors in 2019 declined to prosecute, and police were forced to release the suspects. Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office cited the possibility that the two sides in the shooting on May 30, 2018, were “mutual combatants” – a disputed legal concept that’s a throwback to duels between nobles or prearranged gunfights in the Wild West. That prosecutors passed on charges on those grounds raises questions about whether Chicago gangs can literally get away with murder when it’s unclear who initiated a shooting and who returned fire in self-defense.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is planning his fifth overseas trip of the year, this time to attend a U.N. climate conference in Egypt. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office announced Wednesday that he would take part in the COP27 climate change conference. Holcomb’s schedule includes giving a speech about Indiana’s efforts to increase use of clean energy in the state, the governor’s office said. “I look forward to highlighting the ongoing ways Hoosiers continue to pioneer the way forward, develop sustainable solutions, and lead productive global conversations,” Holcomb said in a statement. Holcomb and state Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers will be part of an Indiana delegation arriving Sunday in Egypt and returning to Indiana on Nov. 12. The trip is being paid for with private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the governor’s office said. Holcomb also plans meetings with businesses and foreign governments and organizations during the conference drawing leaders from nearly 200 nations. The governor has made four previous economic development this year, including to Germany and Switzerland last month and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May. He made two trips in the spring that took him to Sweden, Great Britain, Monaco, Slovakia and Israel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This week the Des Moines Area Religious Council’s network of food pantries broke the record for the number of individuals helped during a single day in the network’s 46-year history. On Tuesday, the network of 15 pantries assisted 1,530 individuals across Polk County, beating the previous record of 1,476 individuals helped in one day Sept. 3, 2019, according to a DMARC news release. Matt Unger, the CEO of DMARC, said even though he expected the record to be broken this month, seeing it happen is still “jarring.” He said he expects this November to be the busiest month in the network’s history. “It’s going to be a big month and it is going to take a tremendous amount of public support for ALL organizations working in the food insecurity space to make sure our community members have AT LEAST the basic groceries they and their households need,” Unger wrote in an email. According to DMARC, rising costs for essential goods such as food and gasoline, coupled with the decrease in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in April, have contributed to the rise in people in need across Iowa. Michelle Book, the president of Food Bank of Iowa, said 1 in 7 working households across the state cannot cover the costs of their basic needs.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A former undersheriff was acquitted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed man he shot with a defective beanbag round five years ago. Virgil Brewer was charged with involuntary manslaughter after he shot Steven Myers using his personal shotgun the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A Wyandotte County jury deliberated for four hours after a weeklong trial before returning the not-guilty verdict. It was unclear if Brewer, who has been on unpaid leave from the Barber County Sheriff’s department since his 2018 arrest, would return to his former role. Brewer and two other officers responded to a call about an armed man on a street after an altercation at a Sun City bar. Myers, who was drunk and had been told to leave the bar, was gone by the time officers arrived. They found him in a shed at a Sun City home. He came out of the shed, and Brewer shot him at close range with a beanbag, which split open and emptied pellets into his chest, causing fatal injuries. Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill ruled Myers’ death a homicide. An expert testified at trial that the beanbag round was defective and should never have been sold or distributed, defense attorney David Harger said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In a move that experts describe as outrageous, the Kentucky Bar Association is seeking to punish a lawyer who brought a scandal to light this summer in which an elected prosecutor was trading favors with a defendant in exchange for nude images of her. An inquiry panel has accused attorney Thomas Clay of violating what is known informally as the “squeal rule” or “rat rule.” The rule says that when a lawyer knows another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Misconduct raising a “substantial question about their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness,” the first lawyer must report it to bar counsel. When Clay learned that Commonwealth’s Attorney Ronny Goldy Jr. had for several years done favors for a defendant in exchange for her giving him nude photos and videos of herself, he reported it to the FBI but not to the bar association’s disciplinary counsel. Clay provided the FBI and the Louisville Courier Journal with 230 pages of Facebook messages documenting the quid quo pro. Just two days after the newspaper published a story that included excerpts of the messages, the bar moved to temporarily suspend Goldy, the elected prosecutor for Bath, Menifee, Montgomery and Rowan counties. Clay’s lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, said his client deserves “praise, not sanction.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A little more than 12% of registered voters in the state have cast their ballots ahead of next week’s elections, keeping up with Louisiana’s steady increase in midterm election turnout. Of the 363,009 residents who participated in the state’s early voting period, which ended Tuesday night, about 42% were registered Democrats, and 43% were Republicans, according to data from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office. Most Louisiana voters opt to vote in person on Election Day. But the percentage who vote early has been steadily increasing. During 2018 midterm elections, about 11% of voters cast their ballots early, up from 8% in 2014 and 4% in 2010. Early voting topped 32% in 2020, though presidential election years tend to draw far more voters than midterms. The state has placed a number of restrictions on mail-in voting. Absentee ballots need a notary or witness signature and can only go to older people, those with disabilities or voters who can show they cannot cast a ballot in person on Election Day. This election, absentee ballots went to about 3% of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: More than $4.3 million in federal funds is on its way to the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District to help purchase 11 new, clean, zero-emission school buses. Such funds essentially will help the district swap out its current fleet of 12 diesel-engine buses. David Cash, the New England regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, made Wells his first stop Monday on his tour of Maine school districts that will be receiving their own slices of more than $13 million from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program. Cash said the buses currently in use create pollution with “long-term impacts on our kids” and contribute to “problematic” issues related to climate change. He called the $5 billion being spent nationwide for new, “clean” school buses “tremendous.” “It’s incumbent upon us to make the right kind of choices and the right kind of investments,” he said. WOCSD is one of 13 school districts in the state that President Joe Biden announced would be part of his administration’s funding for the bus program for the current fiscal year. The funds are a part of the infrastructure bill Biden signed into law last year. WOCSD is receiving the largest share of the $13 million. Overall, the grant funds will help with the purchases of 34 “clean” buses for school districts throughout the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nMontgomery County: Vulgar signs atop a busy roadway are grabbing the attention of drivers and neighbors alike, WUSA-TV reports. Conservative activist Shaun Porter and several other people have recently been holding signs atop the Capital Beltway on the Bradley Boulevard overpass. While holding politically tinged signs near roadways is not a new phenomenon in the D.C. region, Porter’s signs include curse words and sexually graphic language directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Jobe Lett, an 11-year-old Montgomery County resident who lives nearby the overpass, said the signs have become a distraction in his neighborhood “because of the language that they’re using.” Data provided by the state shows more than 200,000 people drive the beltway around the Bradley Boulevard overpass every day. But some of those drivers honk at Porter’s signs. That has also become a problem for neighbors. Homes surround the overpass on both sides. “Hey, I support everyone’s right to (free speech),” Montgomery County Jesse Sanders said. “I just kind of wish it wasn’t in the most residential of areas.” Maryland State Police said obscenity laws are vague, and they have questions about infringing on Porter’s First Amendment rights by asking him to stop.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities who earlier this week said they had finally identified the “Lady of the Dunes,” the woman whose mutilated body was found on Cape Cod in 1974, are now looking for information about a man she may have married. The late Guy Rockwell Muldavin is believed to have married Ruth Marie Terry in February 1974, just a few months before the 37-year-old Terry’s body was found in Provincetown, according to a statement Wednesday from state police, Provincetown police and the Cape and Islands district attorney’s office. Investigators are asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of Terry or Muldavin in New England in 1973 or 1974 to contact them. Muldavin, described as an antiques dealer who also used the names Raoul Guy Rockwell and Guy Muldavin Rockwell, was a suspect in the deaths of a previous wife and a stepdaughter in Seattle in 1960, according to media reports at the time. He was caught in New York City and charged with “unlawful flight.” He died in California in 2002, according to his obituary. The death of the “Lady of the Dunes” was one of the most enduring and frustrating murder mysteries in Massachusetts. A young girl out for a walk found the body in the dunes in Provincetown in July 1974. The woman was naked on a beach blanket with her hands severed – so she could not be identified by her fingerprints, officials said. Her skull was crushed, and she was nearly decapitated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A shortage of poll workers has concerned local election officials in some parts of the country, but Michigan is facing a different side of the trend. Conservative groups and local Republican Party operatives who have pushed false claims about the 2020 presidential election have recruited poll workers in the state by the thousands. Similar recruitment efforts on the right have bolstered the ranks of poll workers in some other states with nationally watched races. Seeding the ranks of front-line election workers with people recruited by groups promoting election conspiracies has raised alarms among some that the people at the foundation of the election system could try to undermine it. “It concerns me when the motivation to serve as a poll worker is fueled through misinformation and people who have been fed lies, in some cases, for years now,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. “Since the spring, clerks have come at us with concerning questions they’re getting and, in some cases, hundreds of poll worker applications that seem to be motivated by nefarious intent.” In Oakland County, the state’s second-most populous, Republicans “discouraged about the outcome of the 2020 election” have been urged to sign up as poll workers through a new Republican National Committee recruitment program.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a former public safety director from New Jersey to take over the city’s police department, as it struggles with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, will start serving as Minneapolis’ police chief Monday. “Everyone is hungry for change in this city. I’m not here to maintain the status quo,” he told reporters after the council vote. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey nominated O’Hara to lead the police department in September and said Thursday that the city needs someone like O’Hara right now. “This moment matters,” Frey said. “The act of stepping up for this job – at this time – is an act of courage.” Minneapolis has been at the center of calls for changes in policing since the May 2020 killing of Floyd, whose death under an officer’s knee led to nationwide demands for racial justice and an end to police brutality. Calls to abolish the department or dismantle and replace it with a new department of public safety were rejected by voters in the city last year. The city is also under a federal investigation into its policing practices, and it is expected that court-enforced changes will be ordered through a consent decree.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State lawmakers met in special session Wednesday and quickly approved nearly $247 million in incentives for an aluminum plant that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs to northern Mississippi by 2029. Many legislators voted on the incentives without knowing the name of the company. At a news conference as the session ended, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged the aluminum project is being developed by Steel Dynamics Inc., an Indiana-based company that already operates a steel mill near Columbus, Mississippi. “They are a fantastic employer in the Golden Triangle today,” Reeves said. Reeves had previously said a nondisclosure agreement prohibited him from publicly naming the company until the deal was done. Only the governor can call a special session, and Democratic legislators questioned why Reeves has not called sessions to address other issues, including funding for Jackson’s troubled water system or for struggling rural hospitals. “Many Mississippians are suffering and dying. But none of these things, despite being matters of literal life and death, compelled the governor to call a special session,” Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez said Wednesday during a Democratic Caucus news conference. “So, what compelled him to bring us back again? A victory lap being portrayed publicly as an emergency? But this feels a lot more like a campaign event, a political pep rally, than public service.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city will pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of an unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2019. The Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners approved the settlement with the family of Terrence Bridges Jr. in a closed meeting earlier this week, The Kansas City Star reports. Bridges, 30, was shot and killed after officers responded to a reported carjacking. Police had contended he was resisting arrest and was shot during a struggle with the officer, identified in police records as Dylan Pifer. The officer told investigators he feared for his life because he thought Bridges was pulling a gun from a sweatshirt. Bridges’ family and civil rights activists said he was not armed, not resisting, did not pose a threat to the officer and was not involved in the carjacking. Tom Porto, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement the settlement represents the police department’s acknowledgement of the tragic and significant loss to Bridges’ family. Pifer, who is still on the police force, was not charged in the killing. A year after Bridges’ death, Pifer was with Sgt. Matthew T. Neal as Neal injured a 15-year-old boy by slamming his face into the pavement after stopping a car the teenager was in. Neal left the department after pleading guilty last week to third-degree assault. He was placed on four years’ probation. Pifer was not charged.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While Budweiser and Coors Light remain the state’s favorite beers, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Department of Agriculture Director Christy Clark have signed a letter of understanding saying Heineken’s parent company, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A., will do more business in Montana, including buying more Treasure State barley. The deal was announced Tuesday, The Daily Montanan reports. While the letter of intent didn’t commit the beverage industry giant to specific amounts or prices, it did say the company was committed to using more Montana products in its beer manufacturing. The “intent to procure increased volumes of high-quality Montana barley” will be met with “transparent market information, producer consultations, and continued investments in barley research” by the state, according to the letter. Gianforte, as well as leaders from Heineken and the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee along with members of the U.S. Grain Council, signed the letter at Bos Hay and Grain at Gallatin Gateway. “We’re thrilled Heineken recognized the superior quality of Montana barley and wants to do more business with our farmers,” Gianforte said. ‘This agreement ushers in tremendous opportunities for our ag industry.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: In the wake of a Halloween block party where a man drove around barricades and toward the crowd before a police officer shot and wounded him, counselors and government officials have been offering help for those who witnessed the chaos. Therapists were available Thursday evening at Minne Lusa Elementary School for those dealing with stress from Monday night’s incident in the same neighborhood, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Project Harmony Deputy Director told the newspaper that officials were hoping to help kids and adults alike process the experience and normalize their feelings, which she said might include fixating on the event, sleep interruptions, irritability and fearing for their own safety. The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out. Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely. Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. It’s not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada asked the state’s secretary of state Wednesday to investigate what it called a “coordinated partisan election administration effort” during rural Nye County’s hand-count of mail-in ballots that was shut down last week until after polls close. The ACLU said a hand-count volunteer openly carrying a firearm removed an ACLU observer from a hand-count tally room, which the organization said it recently discovered was Nye County GOP Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen. The ACLU said the situation “poses questions” surrounding Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf’s delegation of authority to partisan officials to remove observers from hand-count rooms, particularly during a hand-count process that deals with tabulation of ballots.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A boil water order for customers of the Rye Water District has now stretched into its third week following the detection of harmful bacteria in district water samples in mid-October. A public informational meeting has been set for this weekend to discuss the order. Town leaders are continuing to distribute cases of bottled water to affected residents as Rye Water District leadership awaits the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services’ lifting of the order. Three weeks since the enactment of the order, Rye Water District superintendent Arik Jones said he still feels it could take several more days before it’s over. The cause of the water contamination has not been identified, though Jones stated that potential causes could be from “improper irrigation operation and/or maintenance.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDelran: A $2.5 million upgrade at a water-treatment plant here is intended to remove a potentially harmful contaminant from a major source of South Jersey’s drinking water. New Jersey American Water said the improvements will target a man-made chemical found more than two years ago in samples taken from the Delaware River. The utility’s Delran plant processes up to 40 million gallons of river water daily for use by hundreds of thousands of customers in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties. The chemical – 1,4-dioxane – is used as a solvent during manufacturing or industrial processes, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. It is also a byproduct of some consumer products, including detergents and cosmetics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Work to plug hundreds of abandoned oil and gas wells began in southeast New Mexico, amid the U.S.’ most active oilfields in the Permian Basin. The State’s Oil Conservation Division, an agency of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, got about $25 million in initial grant funding via the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, hoping to redouble efforts to plug some of the about 1,700 wells believed to be abandoned throughout New Mexico on state and private land. Operations began Oct. 31 at a well east of Hobbs in Lea County. It was prioritized, the OCD said, as it was reportedly emitting large amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide within 1,000 feet of local homes. Before the federal funds were granted, New Mexico was able to plug about 50 wells a year, but the OCD estimated the funds would allow the agency to clean up about 200 wells in the next 12 months. The money will also help remediate and restore the surfaces of another 50 to 60 locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York will receive up to $524 million from drugmaker Teva to settle claims that the company contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the largest amount secured from an opioid manufacturer or distributor sued by the state, Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday. The state has reached a series of settlements with drug companies following an attorney general’s lawsuit in 2019 accusing them of deceptive marketing and failing to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates were found liable last year for public nuisance charges by a jury on Long Island. To resolve the remedies phase, Teva agreed to pay out $313 million over 18 years, James said. New York will additionally receive $211 million from a $4.3 billion national settlement Teva agreed to in July if it is approved by state and local governments and tribes, according to the attorney general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health agency is weighing whether to challenge a judge’s order demanding that the state ramp up services for people with intellectual and development disabilities to allow more of them to live at home or in their communities. In 2020, Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ruled that too many such people were forced to live in institutions in violation of state law. Baddour allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to address the violation, but recommendations made by a consulting firm haven’t been carried out, the judge wrote Wednesday while directing his own remedies. Baddour ordered that at least 3,000 people must be diverted or shifted to community-based programs by early 2031. Separately, he told DHHS to eliminate before 2032 a waiting list of roughly 16,000 people who are qualified to participate in a Medicaid-funded program that helps them live at home or outside of an institution. A shortage of well-paid direct-care workers also must be addressed by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the judge ruled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An invasive and destructive weed species threatening North Dakota agriculture has been found in three more counties. That raises the total to 19 counties in North Dakota where the so-called “super weed,” also known as Palmer amaranth, has been found since it was first identified in the state four years ago, The Bismarck Tribune reported. “We think it’s a very significant threat to our growers and ranchers,” said Tom Peters, an agronomist and weed control specialist at North Dakota State University and the University of Minnesota. Palmer amaranth can grow as tall as seven feet, even as much as 3 inches per day, and can resist many herbicides, produce hundreds of thousands of seeds and become strong enough to stop farm machinery, according to experts. A heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%, according to research by Purdue University. The plants were recently found in Kidder, Williams and Stark counties, according to the state’s agriculture department. The findings were confirmed by the National Agricultural Genotyping Center at NDSU in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit in Ohio is evoking Christmas memories with a display of historic storybooks, vintage toys and costumes from the sets of the “Brady Bunch” of TV and movies. The show, “A Storybook Christmas Featuring a Very Brady Holiday,” opened Tuesday at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and runs through Dec. 31. The exhibition marks the opening of the holiday season at the historic Reese-Peters House that houses the museum. Across five rooms trimmed for the holidays, visitors will be invited to step into the pages of classic Christmas storybooks including “The Night Before Christmas,” “Polar Express” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Some children’s board books and pop-up books will be arranged with pages open for visitors to read, while others will be positioned along with toys under Christmas trees as gifts, replicating what Christmas morning may have looked like for the Bradys and other families in the 1960s and ’70s. Several costumes and props from the “Brady Bunch” sets have been incorporated into the display by co-curator Randall Thropp, who manages the Paramount Pictures Costume Archive. They include a two-piece pantsuit Florence Henderson wore in the episode where the Bradys travel to the Grand Canyon and a horse sculpture that appeared at the base of the Bradys’ staircase.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt granted another temporary reprieve to death row inmate Richard Glossip, pushing his scheduled execution back until February 2023 so that an appeals court has more time to consider his claim of innocence. Stitt, who is locked in a tough reelection contest, issued an executive order on Wednesday that delays Glossip’s execution, which was scheduled for Nov. 21. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A clemency hearing for Glossip that was scheduled before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board next week also will be delayed. Glossip received the death penalty for the 1997 murder-for-hire killing of his boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese. Prosecutors acknowledge Glossip did not kill Van Treese, but maintain that he paid the hotel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, to do it. Sneed, who received a life sentence but was spared the death penalty, was a key witness in two separate trials in which Glossip was convicted.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland City Council members voted Thursday to create at least three large designated campsites and ban the rest of the roughly 700 encampments currently scattered across the city. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, according to the proposal. “People on the streets deserve our compassion. They need our understanding, and many of them need our help to get off and stay off the streets,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said after the vote. “It is my personal view that these resolutions take an important step forward for the city of Portland to be able to do just that.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A measure to help the Pennsylvania Turnpike recover more unpaid tolls was signed into law Thursday, legislation that could trigger the suspension of thousands of vehicle registrations early next year. Gov. Tom Wolf gave final approval to legislation aimed at getting owners or operators of some 25,000 vehicles to pay their overdue bills for turnpike travel. After the law takes effect in two months, the process will start with the Turnpike Commission notifying registrants they are seeking to have their registrations suspended. At least a month later, the toll agency can ask the Transportation Department to start the process, and PennDOT said it will give the owners six weeks’ notice. “The customer is given several notices and opportunities to pay the tolls they owe before their registration is suspended,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police are investigating an anti-Semitic note left at the reception area of the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design Hillel Center on Sunday. In a letter to the Hillel community, Rabbi Josh Bolton said staff alerted both the campus police and Providence police. “I personally came to campus and met with detectives who opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation remains ongoing,” Rabbi Bolton wrote. Public safety officers, he said, determined there was no threat to Jewish students on campus. Hillel opened its doors Monday at 9 am. “While BRH takes any expression of anti-Semitism very seriously, we will not allow an incident like this to divert our focus from our core mission of building a flourishing Jewish community, and supporting the growth of Jewish students on College Hill,” Bolton wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A man and his girlfriend suspected of killing five people in three states last year have pleaded guilty to two of the killings in South Carolina and have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, authorities said. Tyler Terry and Adrienne Simpson each pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and numerous other charges Wednesday in Chester County, according to media reports. Prosecutors agreed to not seek the death penalty in any of the five killings as long as the couple also pleaded guilty to two shootings near St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Memphis, Tennessee. All five deaths happened in May 2021, investigators said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The University of South Dakota received $552,381 to research the risk of emerging bed bug disease transmission in households across South Dakota earlier this month. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced seven universities were awarded $5.7 million to study populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, like pests, injury hazards and asthma triggers. Those focus populations will be young children and seniors. Although there isn’t evidence that indicates bed bugs are transmitting disease, the goal of the “pro-active” research project is to identify if there’s a risk bed bugs could eventually be contributing to disease in households, said Jose Pietri, the USD assistant professor of microbiology leading the project.\n\nTennessee\n\nMt. Juliet: A Tennessee man who fled a traffic stop with an officer in the vehicle and refused to stop has been fatally shot, authorities said. The shooting happened after Mt. Juliet officers stopped a vehicle late Wednesday and asked the passenger, Eric Jermaine Allen, 39, to exit the vehicle, according to preliminary information from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Instead of exiting, Allen moved from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and began to drive away, the bureau said in a statement. One of the officers attempted to stop Allen by leaning into the vehicle and gave commands for him to stop, but Allen drove away with the officer fully inside the vehicle, the statement said. The officer attempted to use a stun gun, but Allen continued to ignore commands to stop, prompting the officer to fatally shoot Allen. The officer was not injured. Bureau agents are working to independently determine the events leading to the shooting.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed Wednesday that he underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation therapy during the summer for bone cancer in his jaw. Turner made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session after he delivered his annual State of the City address, the Houston Chronicle reported. Turner said he underwent nine hours of surgery on July 30 to remove the osteosarcoma. “Let me tell you, I have been blessed,” Turner said to applause. Turner missed a few weeks of City Council meetings while receiving his radiation therapy in August and September. His staff said he was undergoing medical treatment but did not specify what for. Turner, who has served as Houston’s mayor since 2016 after 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, suffered a bout of COVID-19 last December.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella “Izzy” Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family’s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim.\n\nVermont\n\nStratton: Game wardens are investigating a bear attack in the southern Vermont town of Stratton, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said Thursday. Wardens said the victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the Wednesday evening attack and discharged from Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. Officials did not describe the circumstances of the attack, but said more information would be made public as it becomes available. Vermont wildlife officials said earlier this year that the state was seeing a record number of risky encounters between human and bears.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Seeking to learn more about the election integrity unit of Virginia’s attorney general’s office, the state’s chapter of the NAACP has put down a $20,000 deposit to fulfill a request for unit records. Virginia’s NAACP President Robert Barnette said there’s not enough transparency about the unit and he feels the price aims to discourage the Freedom of Information Act request, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. “Given the importance of fair elections, the attorney general’s stated desire for transparency, we would have thought he would want to make these records public,” Barnette said in a news conference outside the state Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The Bremerton City Council on Wednesday approved unanimously a plan to expand property tax exemptions for developers who build affordable housing in the city. The city remains “far behind the curve” in attracting affordable housing proposals and is thousands of units short of the number of people who desire to live in Bremerton, City Council President Michael Goodnow said. “I look at this as one tool in the toolbox toward solving our housing and homelessness issues,” Goodnow said. While beefing up what’s known as the city’s multifamily property tax exemption program, or MFTE for short, Mayor Greg Wheeler and other city council members had differing opinions about the best methods of bringing new affordable housing projects to the city. For now, the council created new property tax exemptions of both 12 and 20 years for developers who devote a fourth of their units to those defined as low income under a calculation using Kitsap County’s average income levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A West Virginia elementary school principal has been honored as one of the nation’s top educators. Principal Andrea Trio of Madison Elementary in Wheeling received a $25,000 Milken Educator Award from the Milken Family Foundation on Thursday. Up to 40 elementary educators nationwide will receive the awards this school year. Trio is known for walking through the school halls singing with children, using music and other social-emotional behavioral tools to calm her young students. Trio earned a bachelor’s in music education in 2005 from West Virginia University and a master’s in educational leadership in 2014 from Hood College.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Madison Children’s Museum has fired a Wisconsin man with cognitive disabilities after he wore an Adolf Hitler costume over the Halloween weekend. The museum said the man believed he was making a mockery of the Nazi Party’s leader when he wore the costume on a busy street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus on Saturday. He was fired Tuesday night, after his costume was condemned on social media and by some news outlets, including the Jerusalem Post. The museum said in a statement that it fired the man after it “determined that his continued employment would create an environment at odds with our values and unwelcoming to visitors and staff.” The statement said the man’s costume was “completely unacceptable” and that the museum stands against antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination. The museum also said the man has cognitive disabilities due to a traumatic brain injury and that his work over the last decade has been supervised. “It is our understanding that he believed his costume to be mocking Hitler,” the statement said. The Madison Police Department called the costume “offensive and reprehensible,” but said wearing it was not a crime. Police said they told the man about the concerns his costume raised.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Sexual assault reports and complaints about equal-opportunity employment in the Wyoming National Guard have increased in the past year, a military official told state lawmakers Wednesday. While Greg Porter, adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, noted that sexual assault is a national problem, he told the state’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee that the state ranks “among the top 10 in forcible rapes in the U.S.,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Rep. Mark Baker, R-Green River, said while reports in the Guard have risen – suggesting service members feel more comfortable speaking up – he still fears the numbers don’t properly illustrate the scope of the problem, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/11/crystal-cathedral-reborn-catholic-wiki-editathon-conjuring-house-news-around-states/39673771/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University has a new dual-degree program for students interested in both engineering and the German language, a boon especially to those hoping to work with foreign automakers in the state. A statement from the school says the new program has students taking four years of classes in Auburn and one year in Germany, where they’ll study at a partner school and work in an internship. The degree could help students wanting to work in fields including automotive manufacturing – the German automaker Mercedes-Benz has a plant that employs thousands in Tuscaloosa County. In all, almost 90 German companies have operations in Alabama. The university says the new program is a joint effort between the colleges of engineering and liberal arts. Most Auburn students minoring in German are engineering majors.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A mining company wants to begin exploratory drilling for the rare element vanadium in southeast Alaska. CoastAlaska reports that Northern Cobalt Ltd., an Australian firm, has applied to the U.S. Forest Service for the proposed project on Snettisham Inlet. The site is located in the Tongass National Forest, about 35 miles southeast of Juneau. Vanadium is used in steel alloys, as well as rechargeable industrial batteries. There are no active federal mining claims at the site. Exploratory drilling for iron ore was conducted at the location in 2012, but those claims were abandoned amid a collapse in iron prices. In a promotional video, the company’s managing director, Michael Schwarz, notes the site’s proximity to a power station. The Forest Service is reviewing the company’s application and accepting public comments through July 26.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new report from Smart Growth America has ranked the state’s 7th Congressional District – which encompasses much of central and west Phoenix, as well as Glendale – the most dangerous place to walk in America. From 2008 to 2017, 344 pedestrians were killed in the 7th District alone – 4.48 for every 100,000 citizens, and the highest of any U.S. congressional district, according to the report. An Arizona Republic investigation published earlier this year found that 10 out of 12 “hot spots” where pedestrian crashes occur frequently are in the 7th Congressional District. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who represents the district, joined with colleagues to introduce a street safety bill titled the “Complete Streets Act of 2019” on Wednesday in the House and Senate.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees has approved a 3.1% salary increase for the chancellor at the system’s flagship campus. The raise for Joe Steinmetz, approved Tuesday, brings his annual total compensation to $714,000. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, that amount includes an annual salary of $464,000 and annual deferred compensation of $250,000 for Steinmetz. The board of trustees also approved pay increases for other employees Tuesday during a teleconference meeting, including 10% increases for the deans of UA’s Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design and the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. Also Tuesday, the board approved a 2.1% pay increase for UA Chancellor Emeritus G. David Gearhart, bringing his annual salary to just under $290,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nGarden Grove: An iconic, glass-paned church in Orange County that once housed a booming televangelist ministry has been transformed into a cathedral to give the region’s Catholics a long-awaited and much larger place to congregate and pray. The landmark building, with a facade made up of nearly 11,000 glass panes, was long known as the Rev. Robert H. Schuller’s Crystal Cathedral. It appears unchanged from the outside. But the cavernous house of worship is covered on the inside with quatrefoil window shades that send sunlight cascading across a stone altar, wooden pews and steel crucifix befitting a Catholic cathedral. The new Christ Cathedral will be dedicated next Wednesday after a $77 million makeover. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the building after Schuller’s church went bankrupt in 2010.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State wildlife officials have released thousands of cutthroat trout into the wild in an effort to preserve the fish. The Denver Post reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials released an estimated 4,500 fingerlings that were transported to Cottonwood Creek near Westcliffe on July 1. Officials say the rare subspecies of fish are descendants of 158 cutthroat trout rescued from a wildfire that burned more than 25 square miles in the Sangre de Cristo Range in southern Colorado. Officials say ash from the fire three summers ago made water in Hayden Creek uninhabitable, and the surviving fish were taken to a hatchery near Crested Butte to spawn. The transport to Cottonwood Creek was conducted by Colorado wildlife and U.S. Forest Service staff and volunteers from Trout Unlimited.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A research scientist who worked at NASA and a chronic disease epidemiologist are just two of Yale University’s renowned female graduates, professors and staff who have gone unmentioned on the pages of Wikipedia. Dozens of Yale students and staff gathered Tuesday at the Yale School of Management to learn how to give those and many other Yale women their due on the predominantly male, English version of the crowd-sourced, online encyclopedia. Organizers of Tuesday’s “editathon” said they also hope to encourage more women to edit articles on the popular online encyclopedia, which relies on user-generated information. Professor Julia Adams, a historical sociologist, has written about female academics who were not included in academic papers and says that makes it difficult to refer to them on Wikipedia, which requires cited articles and journals for biographies.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Activist Sarah McBride is running for the state Senate in 2020. The 28-year-old Wilmington native announced Tuesday that she will try to replace Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington North, who is retiring at the end of his term. McBride rose to national prominence in 2016 when she became the first openly transgender person to speak at the Democratic National Convention. Long involved in politics, she is the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group in the U.S. She plans to stay in that position part time during her campaign but would leave to be a full-time legislator if she wins, she said. McBride first made headlines in 2012, when she came out publicly as transgender at the end of her term as American University student body president.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: It wasn’t a one-time deal. President Donald Trump says he’s planning a repeat of last week’s “Salute to America” Fourth of July festivities that included a speech by him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump says that it was “a wonderful day for all Americans” and that, “based on its tremendous successes,” his administration has “made the decision to do it again next year and maybe we can say for the foreseeable future.” Trump’s decision to speak at the event drew protesters who objected to the inclusion of military equipment and what they saw as his co-opting of the holiday. Trump is calling the event “remarkable” and praising the “incredible, big, beautiful crowds” it drew despite the rain. “We celebrated freedom in all of its magnificence,” he says.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Non-native iguanas are multiplying so rapidly that a state wildlife agency is encouraging people to kill them. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission news release says people should exterminate the large green lizards on their properties as well as on 22 public land areas across South Florida. It doesn’t say just how civilians should try to kill them. “Homeowners do not need a permit to kill iguanas on their own property, and the FWC encourages homeowners to kill green iguanas on their own property whenever possible,” the agency says. Iguanas aren’t dangerous or aggressive to humans, but they damage seawalls, sidewalks and landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. The males can grow to at least 5 feet long and weigh nearly 20 pounds. The commission says female iguanas can lay nearly 80 eggs a year, and South Florida’s warm climate is perfect for the prehistoric-looking animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayor has signed legislation banning smoking and vaping in enclosed areas such as bars, restaurants and one of the world’s busiest airports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the legislation signed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will go into effect Jan. 2. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has been one of the few major U.S. hubs where people could still smoke inside designated rooms. Airport spokesman Andrew Gobeil has said the smoking rooms will be repurposed. Smokers will instead be allowed to smoke in an outdoor terminal smoking area before heading through security. The ban excludes private residences and establishments that ban minors and generate at least 20% of their income from tobacco product sales.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Tuesday he’d veto a bill that would require websites like Airbnb to collect and pay taxes on behalf of short-term vacation rental hosts, saying he wanted the state to coordinate with counties like Honolulu that have new regulations. Ige said he’s concerned the bill, if enacted, would legitimize illegal vacation rental operations. This is an issue across the state, where property owners have been renting homes in residential areas to tourists on a short-term basis without permits. The popularity of the practice has surged with the emergence of websites like Airbnb and HomeAway.com. On Oahu, home to Honolulu and the state’s most populated island, only about 800 vacation rental and bed-and-breakfast operators have permits to rent to tenants for less than 30 days, but there are an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 vacation rentals.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Department of Labor is eliminating more than half of its job service offices. The Idaho Press reports 14 of the 25 offices in the state will close by September. Department director Jani Revier says the new model will directly serve more people. Labor manager Dave Darrow says the new approach will allow the agency to serve people where there is the most need. Under the plan, there would be six primary regional offices and five affiliate offices providing services for job-seekers and employers across the state. Former state Sen. Shawn Keough says the new model will be a hardship on rural towns. Moscow was the first to close its office last week.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police investigators have cracked the case: A 4- to 5-foot alligator is living in a lagoon at one of the city’s most popular parks. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says investigators went to Humboldt Park Lagoon on the city’s West Side and confirmed the unusual resident is there, as reported on social media. Officials couldn’t say how the creature got there. City officials say alligator traps are being placed around the lagoon in hopes the animal will swim into one and be safely removed. Guglielmi says the animal was expected to be trapped “and relocated to a zoo for veterinary evaluation.” Alligators favor warm-weather climates such as Florida but have been known to survive temporarily in the cold through a process similar to hibernation.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Agricultural officials say this year’s corn crop in the state is expected to be among the lowest quality in three decades following planting delays caused by excessive spring rainfall. Greg Matli, a statistician with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, tells The Herald-Times that the agency expects Indiana’s 2019 corn to be the fifth-lowest in quality since 1986. Monday’s report from the agency rates just 38% of Indiana’s corn crop as currently of good to excellent quality. That comes after heavy spring rains significantly delayed the planting of corn and soybeans, likely lowering crop yields. Sadie Davis, Purdue Extension office director in Greene County, calls this spring’s wet field conditions “astounding” and something Hoosier farmers haven’t seen in a long time.\n\nIowa\n\nOrange City: A magistrate has refused to dismiss a criminal mischief charge against a religious activist accused of burning four LGBTQ children’s books that he checked out of a library. Prosecutors say 63-year-old Paul Dorr posted a video on Facebook in October in which he denounced the Orange City library for having the books and threw them into a burning barrel. He argued in his motion for dismissal that he was singled out for prosecution because of the message he was sending. Sioux County District Court records show that Magistrate Lisa Mazurek said in her ruling issued Monday that Dorr didn’t prove his assertions and that the only message being sent to him is “that he cannot burn books that do not belong to him.” His trial is set for Aug. 6.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city has opened a 91-acre wetland park in an area where thousands of migratory birds stop each year. The Wichita Eagle reports that visitors to the Pracht Wetlands Park can walk over galvanized-steel boardwalks and watch birds behind two observation points that are similar to duck blinds. Eventually there will be a half-mile loop of boardwalk circling the northern half of the park with multiple observation points and an observation tower. The total budget for the project is about $7.5 million. The City Council representative for the area, Bryan Frye, says that just under $2 million has been invested in it so far. Just to the west of the park, a major new retail-and-restaurant development is in the works. Frye described the project as “an eco-tourism opportunity.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBurgin: Officials have announced a new aftercare program meant to help prison inmates in addiction recovery avoid relapse. Kentucky Justice Secretary John Tilley says the program will provide a new system of support, mentoring and peer accountability for those offenders. Participants will live together in a dormitory located at Northpoint Training Center, a medium-custody prison in central Kentucky. State officials say SOAR, or Supporting Others in Active Recovery, focuses on preventing drug relapses and providing education and skills to rejoin a community upon release. It’s funded in part by a $300,000 grant from the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy. It is currently available for up to 88 inmates who have completed a substance abuse program and other requirements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nColumbia: Some 14 alligator snapping turtles reared at a fish hatchery are now swimming about in the wild. The release at Boeuf Wildlife Management Area in Caldwell Parish was part of a head-start program to replenish the species, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries says. The federal government is scheduled to decide next year whether to declare the turtles endangered or threatened. State biologists are working to reduce the need for such a listing. Adult alligator snapping turtles have formidable jaws. But most babies get eaten by larger animals. So since 2012, department biologists have raised hundreds of turtles for release when they’re bigger. Those released Wednesday ranged from 6 inches to 12.5 inches and from at least 2 to at least 6 years old, biologist Keri Lejeune of the department’s Wildlife Diversity Program says. The 51,100-acre wildlife management area southeast of Columbia includes eight bayous and 26 lakes.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s agriculture commissioner is asking the federal government to use a new program to buoy the wild blueberry industry during a difficult time. Blueberry harvesters collected about 57 million pounds of the fruit in 2018. That was down nearly 11 million pounds from the previous year, and prices have been low. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal is asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture for help via its market facilitation program. USDA launched the program last year to assist growers negatively affected by foreign trade retaliation. Beal says the program will provide more than $14 billion in direct payments to producers this year, but wild blueberries are not included in the program’s list of crops. Beal says Maine’s blueberry growers are often overlooked by programs and “deserve this needed support.”\n\nMaryland\n\nGlenelg: It appears Wi-Fi was the downfall of four teenagers who sneaked onto their school’s property the night before graduation last year and covered it in racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic graffiti. The Washington Post reports in a Tuesday story that the teens covered their faces during the hate crime but didn’t realize their cellphones automatically connected to Glenelg High School’s Wi-Fi under their individual student IDs. Seth Taylor, Tyler Curtiss, Joshua Shaffer and Matthew Lipp were soon arrested. Taylor said the teens meant to spray-paint “Class of 2018” on the sidewalk as a senior prank, but things got out of hand. Sentences for the four teens ranged from eight to 18 weekends behind bars.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreat Barrington: A couple is working to preserve a crumbling hilltop cabin in western Massachusetts where the civil rights leader James Weldon Johnson wrote one of his most famous works. The Berkshire Eagle reports Rufus Jones and Jill Rosenberg-Jones, of New Jersey, purchased in 2011 a summer home on a 5-acre property in Great Barrington that once belonged to Johnson. They’re now turning their attention to saving the cabin where Johnson wrote “God’s Trombones,” a 1927 book of spiritual poetry. Johnson was an early leader of the NAACP and also a college professor, diplomat and songwriter. He died in 1938. Jones and Rosenberg-Jones say the cabin perched in an ancient hemlock grove has fallen into disrepair and could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to restore. The couple created a foundation in 2016 to help keep Johnson’s legacy alive.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: DTE Energy and the state’s prison system have launched a tree-trimming program that aims to fill open jobs and find full-time employment for released inmates. State, utility and union officials announced the program Tuesday at the Parnall Correctional Facility’s Vocational Village in Jackson. The first class of 24 started there last month. Prisoners who complete the training program will be eligible to join the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 17 and take an open job with a local tree-trimming supplier. Creators say the prisoners gain experience and get a job upon release – a challenge for many parolees. A stable job also reduces the chance they will return to prison. Officials also say the new pool of eligible workers will ease a shortage of trained people for the tree-trimming work.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report finds that murders decreased in the state last year, but rapes increased. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension released the 2018 crime report Monday that says violent crimes – including murder, rape, robbery, human trafficking and aggravated assault – decreased by nearly 7% in 2018. Murders in Minnesota decreased from 114 in 2017 to 104 in 2018. But rapes were up 9% in 2018. Robberies and aggravated assault both declined in 2018. Property crimes in Minnesota decreased nearly 9% in 2018. Motor vehicle theft was up for the third consecutive year. But burglary, theft and arson all declined, with arson numbers dropping to 426 in 2018, the lowest number since Minnesota started tracking arson crimes. The report is based on data reported by local law enforcement agencies.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Republican candidate for governor says he would not let a female journalist follow him while campaigning unless she was accompanied by a male colleague – and now he’s trying to raise campaign money based on that because he says the “liberal media” are attacking him. “Before our decision to run, my wife and I made a commitment to follow the ‘Billy Graham Rule,’ which is to avoid any situation that may evoke suspicion or compromise of our marriage,” Robert Foster said in a fundraising email Wednesday. Larrison Campbell with online publication Mississippi Today wrote that she requested to “shadow” Foster to report about his campaign before the Aug. 6 primary, and his campaign director told her Foster wouldn’t ride in a vehicle alone with her because people could insinuate Foster and Campbell are having an affair.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Older residents of the Show-Me State soon will be able to get out of jury duty, if they so choose. Legislation signed Tuesday by Gov. Mike Parson will allow anyone age 75 or older to ask a court to be excused from jury duty. The judge will have to grant the request. The exemption is being added to a list of a half-dozen other categories of people who can be excused from jury duty. Those include nursing mothers, health care providers, and people for whom jury duty would impose an extreme physical or financial hardship. The new jury duty exemption will take effect Aug. 28.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Two groups are working on ballot initiatives seeking to legalize and tax recreational marijuana in the state. One group, MontanaCan, submitted proposed ballot language to the secretary of state’s office June 28. The Legislative Services Division is reviewing the language. The Missoulian reports another group, Coalition 406, is still surveying people and holding focus groups as it drafts its proposed ballot language. The organizations would have to gather about 25,000 signatures to qualify the issue for the November 2020 ballot. Both measures call for using the tracking, testing and regulation of the state’s medical marijuana program, taxing recreational marijuana at about 15%, and reducing or eliminating the tax on medical marijuana.\n\nNebraska\n\nHastings: Runoff from heavy rains in south-central Nebraska is moving down several rivers, posing new flood threats. Warnings were issued after up to 9 inches of rain fell in some spots during storms that struck Buffalo, Dawson, Frontier, Gosper, Kearney and Phelps counties overnight Monday. Floodwater entered several communities, including Kearney, where several people were stranded in their homes or vehicles. The National Weather Service says the Wood River at Alda is expected to crest Friday less than a foot below the record set June 16, 1967. The service says the water will reach houses on the north side of town and cover U.S. Highway 30. Floodwater also invaded the town of about 660 residents after the drenching March storms that hastened the snowmelt and caused widespread flooding in much of eastern Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Burning Man and neon lights are the predominant theme for the planned Reno Neon Line, which will see the installation of several art pieces in the Biggest Little City’s downtown Fourth Street corridor starting this week. Two sculptures will be installed this week, followed by two more next week, according to Jacobs Entertainment. A total of eight to 10 sculptures will be installed at the Reno Neon Line over the next two years. The first four sculptures are Desert Guard, a giant steel Mongolian warrior by artist Lu Ming; SQUARED, a 50-foot, tree-like LED lantern sculpture by industrial artist Charles Gadeken; Bloom, a large interactive sculpture by Michael Christian featuring lights and steel; and Rearing Horse, a kinetic horse sculpture made of found objects and built by Elko artist and inventor Barry Crawford. The installations will light up in the evenings with vibrant neon colors.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Democratic congressional delegation is welcoming Senate passage of a bill creating a commemorative coin to honor Christa McAuliffe, the Concord High School teacher who died in the NASA space shuttle Challenger disaster 33 years ago. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan introduced legislation in January to create a $1 coin to raise money for the FIRST Robotics program, while Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas introduced a House version of the bill. They said the coin would both honor McAuliffe and reaffirm Congress’ commitment to science education. The Senate bill passed Tuesday, and the House will now take up the bill. McAuliffe would have been NASA’s first designated teacher in space. She and six crewmates were killed when the Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff Jan. 28, 1986.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: America’s Playground is going green this week. The second annual Atlantic City Vegan Food Festival comes to the Showboat Hotel from Friday through Sunday. This year’s celebration of the vegan lifestyle, which uses no animal products, will be headlined by a talk from actress and activist Harley Quinn Smith. Smith, the star of “Yoga Hosers” who is featured in Quentin Tarantino’s July 26 release “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” will appear in on-stage conversation with Alex Biese, features reporter for the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. The Red Bank-born Smith also happens to be the daughter of Highlands-native filmmaker Kevin Smith. General admission tickets, if purchased in advance, are $8 for the food truck festival Friday and $15 for the food festival Saturday. Kids ages 13 and under are free.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Environmentalists are going back to court in hopes of putting the brakes on plans to thin thousands of forested acres in the mountains bordering the city. Wild Watershed and others filed their appeal Monday, arguing that a U.S. district court judge erred when allowing the Santa Fe National Forest to move ahead with its plans for Pacheco Canyon and areas near Hyde Memorial State Park. The plaintiffs say forest officials failed to analyze the cumulative and indirect effects of clearing and burning in the area. In initially approving the projects, forest managers said the work needed to be done to reduce risks posed by disease, insect infestation and catastrophic wildfire. The environmentalists are concerned that the projects will end up targeting larger, older trees that are critical for many species.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has expanded a law that prohibits gender pay discrimination, making it illegal to pay someone less based on characteristics including race, religion, disability or gender identity. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the changes into law in Manhattan on Wednesday, just before joining the U.S. women’s soccer team for a parade in New York City honoring their World Cup victory. Members of the team have filed a lawsuit demanding pay equity with the men’s soccer team, adding fuel to the broader debate over pay disparities that continue to affect millions of American workers. The new law, which takes effect in 90 days, also changes a legal standard for pay equity to make it easier for employees to prove discrimination in court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Hurricanes, thievery and wrecks are taking out the state’s popular historical highway markers faster than the state can keep up. Historical marker program administrator Ansley Herring Wegner says five historical markers are missing, and a sixth that had been missing may be damaged beyond repair. More than 1,600 of the markers known as “history on a stick” stand along state roads, telling the stories of people and places that shaped the past. Replacing each costs $1,790. Wegner says the annual budget for new markers, repairs and replacements is $60,000. When she took her job in 2014, Wegner began keeping a database of missing markers and found some that had disappeared in the 1980s. The program began in 1936, when the first marker was placed in Granville County in honor of John Penn, who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Fourteen high schools in the state plan to form competitive video gaming teams during this upcoming school year as interest in esports increases nationwide, including at the collegiate level, where scholarships are offered for varsity teams. The Bismarck Tribune reports Mandan High School is one of them. Mandan Superintendent Mike Bitz says the school will spend about $20,000 this year to buy computers and other equipment to construct an esports lab for students. Bitz says esports will help an “underrepresented population” of students who might not otherwise partake in school athletics or activities feel more included. The Mandan esports season is slated to begin in October and will last through December. Two universities in North Dakota have an esports team, and two more colleges will launch teams this fall.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Discussions are underway to build a kid-friendly park as the city’s downtown population grows. Estimates show the number of people living downtown has grown to between 15,000 and 20,000 people, making it one of Cleveland’s biggest neighborhoods. Heather Holmes, the Downtown Cleveland Alliance’s vice president for marketing, tells Cleveland.com that her group, the city and downtown councilman Kerry McCormack have all been talking about the idea. Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that more than 1,100 children live in the general downtown area, with the number of children under 14 more than doubling over a decade. The park would be in addition to green space like the newly renovated Public Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Community leaders say they’re cautiously optimistic that the city’s new police chief will improve relations between the police department and historically underrepresented groups. Wade Gourley, 51, was appointed Monday as the department’s first new chief in 15 years and will oversee more than 1,200 uniformed officers. A 30-year veteran of the force, Gourley replaces former Chief Bill Citty, who retired in May after 41 years with the agency. Kris Steele, executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform, told The Oklahoman he hopes Gourley recruits and employs a diverse police force. About 6% of the department’s officers are Hispanic, 6% are black, and 1% are Asian. But the Census Bureau says Oklahoma City’s population is 18.5% Hispanic, 14.3% black and 4% Asian.\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Local officials in southern Oregon are asking the federal government to reject a proposed natural gas pipeline. The Medford Mail-Tribune reports the Canadian company Pembina wants to build a 229-mile underground pipeline to ship natural gas overseas to Asian markets. But county commissioners in Southern Oregon’s Jackson County say in a joint letter this month that the project would violate environmental laws and provide only short-term economic benefits to the area. Commissioners say Pembina is asking for exemptions to federal environmental regulations meant to protect forests and rare species. They add the project would only bring temporary construction jobs to the area and provide fleeting economic benefits. Pembina says it hopes to address the county officials’ concerns in future meetings.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf is moving to borrow up to $90 million to help counties pay for new voting machines ahead of 2020’s election, announcing the step Tuesday after a dispute between the Democrat and the Republican-controlled Legislature doomed funding legislation. Wolf said he was ordering a bond issue that would reimburse each county for 60% of their cost, according to Wolf’s administration, which provided little detail about the financing it will seek or the timeline for the move. Wolf began pressing counties last year to replace their voting machines before 2020 after federal authorities warned Pennsylvania and at least 20 other states that Russian hackers targeted them during 2016’s presidential election. That prompted a wide range of election integrity advocates and experts to urge states to switch to machines that produce an auditable paper trail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nHarrisville: A farmhouse that inspired the horror movie “The Conjuring” has new owners. Cory Heinzen tells the Sun Journal in Maine that he’s heard doors opening, footsteps and knocks. He says the house in Harrisville, Rhode Island, is “very busy.” The movie is based on the story of a family that lived in the farmhouse in the 1970s. The previous owners said the 1736 farmhouse was indeed haunted – by trespassers hoping to get a glimpse thanks to the 2013 movie. Heinzen, of Mexico, Maine, says he became interested in the paranormal while bivouacking at a Civil War battlefield and hearing screams and cannons. He and his wife bought the Rhode Island home last month and hope to open it to visitors and investigators later this year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A second police officer has resigned after authorities determined he was writing bogus traffic tickets to drivers without their knowledge. A statement from the Charleston Police Department says Blaine Morgan resigned Wednesday. Officer Michael Baker quit last week after an internal review of the traffic tickets. The department says the officers were writing the tickets so it looked like they were properly patrolling their area of Charleston. They would then dismiss the bogus tickets. The officers have not spoken about the investigation. Police say they have dropped all pending tickets written by the two officers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Regulators have approved a permit for construction of a wind farm in the northeastern part of the state. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission approved a permit with conditions Tuesday to build the Crowned Ridge Wind Farm. The proposed wind farm will cover more than 53,000 acres in Grant and Codington counties and be capable of producing as much as 300 megawatts of energy from up to 130 wind turbines. Northern States Power Co., doing business as Xcel Energy, will purchase energy produced by the wind farm. Among the conditions the PUC placed on the permit are addressing sound levels and shadow flicker experienced by nearby residents, detecting ice on turbine blades, and monitoring grouse mating areas within the wind farm area once construction is complete. Crowned Ridge Wind estimates the wind farm will cost $400 million. Construction is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State health officials are launching a new public education and awareness campaign focusing on the impact of the opioid crisis. The state Department of Health says the campaign will kick off next Tuesday at the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. The initiative will feature stories from people from every Tennessee county about how they have been personally affected by the opioid epidemic. It will also share information on how people can be part of the solution. With the project, state health officials will introduce a statewide media campaign and share materials with community partners to provide info on local resources. The campaign is funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Opioid Crisis Cooperative Agreement.\n\nTexas\n\nSurfside Beach: Kemp’s ridley sea turtles are critically endangered, but numerous volunteers patrol Brazoria County beaches every day during the nesting season to do their part to change that. The (Brazosport) Facts reports Texas A&M University at Galveston and Turtle Island Restoration Network partner to bring the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle eggs found along the Upper Texas Coast to Padre Island National Seashore, where they are incubated until ready to hatch and crawl out to the Gulf of Mexico. Volunteers patrol the 72 miles of beach from the Bolivar Peninsula to Surfside Jetty County Park by foot and utility task vehicles to spot turtle tracks and nests of eggs, says Joanie Steinhaus, the Gulf of Mexico program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. Volunteers patrol each year during the nesting season from April 1 to July 15, says Christopher Marshall, director of the Gulf Center for Sea Turtle Research.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is planning to expand its remote-working program in hopes of reducing emissions and saving office space. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said Monday that more than 2,500 state employees could eventually become authorized to work from home. Utah recently ran a teleworking pilot program with 136 employees who worked at least 3 days a week from home. Officials say it saved carbon-dioxide emissions from cars, and employees showed a 20% improvement in performance. Employees who participated in the program gave up permanent work spaces in favor of temporary shared workspaces, a model that saved space and is expected to be repeated at the new West Valley State Office Building.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Officials say an invasive beetle discovered a year ago in the state is chomping its way through trees in northern and central Vermont. Arborists in Burlington and other cities have considered treating prize trees to kill the emerald ash borer. Foresters, meanwhile, simply want to slow the spread of the pest. The emerald ash borer was first found in Michigan in 2002 and has spread to dozens of states and four Canadian provinces. Tony D’Amato, forestry program director at the University of Vermont, says the insects normally spread 1 to 2 miles a year, but they’re spreading much faster by hitching rides on firewood containing the insect’s eggs and larvae.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Deep-pocketed interest groups and activists on both sides of the long-running fight over gun laws are gearing up for a major clash in the state, now a key election battleground in the issue after Republicans on Tuesday adjourned a special legislative session called by the governor to consider gun-control measures in the wake of a mass shooting. The state’s off-year election will be closely watched because Virginia is the only state where control of the Legislature is up for grabs in 2019. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. GOP lawmakers abruptly ended the session after less than two hours and postponed any movement on gun laws until after the November election. Democrats and gun-control advocates vowed to force them from office. Scores of gun-control advocates had gathered Tuesday outside the Capitol.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife has authorized killing some members of a wolf pack that are preying on cattle in northeastern Washington state. Agency director Kelly Susewind on Wednesday gave authority for the state to kill some members of the OPT pack in an effort to change the behavior of the pack. The action came after a cow was found Saturday in Ferry County that had been killed and partially consumed by wolves. The agency says the carcass suffered numerous bite wounds, accompanied by hemorrhaging. Wolf tracks were also seen at the site. Last year, the agency killed most members of the OPT pack that were preying on livestock. Conservation groups contend that repeatedly killing wolves in the same area does not stop cattle depredations.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A teachers union says it plans to sue over a sweeping GOP education bill that allows the creation of the state’s first charter schools. The West Virginia Education Association released a statement Wednesday saying it has sent the attorney general a formal intent-to-sue letter that alleges the legislation violates the state constitution. Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed the measure late last month after a gridlocked special session drew several heavy protests from teachers. The broad-based measure deals with several aspects of the state’s education system, but educators and Democrats fiercely opposed the provision to allow charters. They argued that charters would end up steering money away from public schools.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Mortgage foreclosure filings in the state have plunged to less than a quarter of what they were during the Great Recession and, in another economic downturn, aren’t likely to become so pervasive, says an economist who tracks foreclosures in Wisconsin. “I almost think it would be hard to get back there because we’re at such a low level now,” says Russell Kashian, a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater economics professor who oversees the college’s Fiscal and Economic Research Center. Data gathered by the center shows that through the first half of 2019, foreclosure filings in the state totaled 3,565 – the lowest in at least 19 years for that span. This year’s foreclosure tally amounts to 16% fewer than the 4,248 filed during the same period in 2018 and less than a fourth of the 15,427 recorded in the January-through-June stretch of recession-riddled 2009.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: The state Game and Fish Department wants people to turn in dead sage grouse they find so the birds can be tested for West Nile virus. Sage grouse have little resistance to West Nile, and the virus is often fatal to the chicken-sized, ground-dwelling birds. Wyoming is among just a handful of states with large populations of sage grouse. Leslie Schreiber with the Game and Fish Department says recent wet weather could encourage mosquitoes that can transmit West Nile to sage grouse. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports you’re unlikely to catch West Nile by handling a dead bird. State officials say people who find a sage grouse that hasn’t died from an obvious injury should double-bag the carcass and take it to a local Game and Fish office.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/04/travel-hypocrisy-street-racing-vaccine-limitations-news-around-states/115097638/", "title": "Travel hypocrisy, street racing: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state hit new highs Wednesday for the numbers of coronavirus cases reported in a single day and patients hospitalized with COVID-19, health officials said as hospitals brace for an additional wave of cases in the weeks following Thanksgiving gatherings. Dr. Scott Harris, the state health officer, said excluding backlogged cases, the state reported more than 3,000 additional virus cases Wednesday, a new daily record. The state also reported having 1,801 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest number since the pandemic began. “There is simply a great deal of community transmission occurring right now in most parts of Alabama. Now, more than ever, we hope that Alabamians can avoid large gatherings, wear masks in public and try to maintain a 6-foot distance from other households whenever possible,” Harris said. About 1 in 3 patients in intensive care units in the state has COVID-19, said Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association. Only 10% of the state’s 1,634 intensive care beds were available Monday, Williamson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second inmate at a prison experiencing a coronavirus outbreak has died from complications related to COVID-19, as the total number of active cases at the state’s largest prison has reached 480, the Alaska Department of Corrections said Tuesday. The 77-year-old with underlying health issues, who was serving sentences for sexual abuse and release violations, died Monday after being taken to a Palmer hospital Nov. 22, the department said. Both prisoners who’ve died of the virus in the state were inmates at Goose Creek Correctional Center near Wasilla, which has been experiencing an outbreak. The department said it offered tests to about 1,300 inmates at the prison to try to find undetected cases. Results brought the facility’s active case count to 480, with results in 120 cases pending and another roughly 190 inmates considered recovered, the department said. Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said it “can only offer and recommend testing” – not require it – but she said there were few refusals to be tested.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Top hospital officials across Arizona urged the state Wednesday to take more action to stop the spread of COVID-19, making a bleak projection that the health care system could go beyond capacity later this month. Gov. Doug Ducey acknowledged that “the numbers in Arizona are heading in the wrong direction,” but he declined to order a statewide mask mandate, curfew or business lockdown. “I don’t think the right answer is to throw hundreds of thousands of Arizonans out of work right before the holidays,” Ducey said. Better enforcement of existing restrictions on restaurants, bars and gyms, along with local mask mandates and good hygiene, are sufficient, he said. Businesses that skirt safety protocols will face closure after a second offense, he said. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, is predicting it could surpass its hospital bed capacity as early as next week and 125% of bed capacity by mid-December.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A White House panel said in a report released Wednesday that Arkansas remains in the “red zone” for new coronavirus cases as the state set a new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations for the fourth day in a row. The White House Coronavirus Task Force said Arkansas last week ranked 24th in the country for new cases per capita. The state’s test positivity ranked 30th, according to the panel. The panel said 88% of the state’s counties have moderate or high levels of community transmission of the virus. The report said cases may be reaching a plateau in Arkansas, but the percentage of nursing homes with at least one coronavirus-positive staff member and positive residents is increasing. The panel again recommended restaurants in the state limit indoor dining capacity to less than 25%, a proposal Gov. Asa Hutchinson has previously rejected. The number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 increased Wednesday by 14 to a new high of 1,088, the Department of Health said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will likely order most of its businesses to close or limit capacity in the coming days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, as part of new rules triggered when less than 15% of beds are available in intensive care units for regional hospital networks. Newsom said four of the state’s five regions – excluding the San Francisco Bay Area – will meet that threshold within a day or two. When they do, the state will order the closure of all hair salons and barbershops; bars, breweries and distilleries; casinos; and indoor and outdoor playgrounds. Restaurants would be limited to takeout and delivery only, while retailers must limit customers inside their stories to 20% capacity during the busy holiday shopping season. California on Wednesday reported more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases, the most ever in one day. A record 8,500 people are in hospitals, including more than 2,000 in intensive care units, leaving the state with fewer than 2,000 available intensive care beds.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The ACLU of Colorado and a county sheriff’s office have reached an agreement to implement measures at the county’s jail to better protect inmates from the coronavirus pandemic. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams and the ACLU have asked a federal judge to enter a consent decree between the two sides to officially implement the changes and provide federal oversight. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit in April alleging that the sheriff’s office had failed to meet public health orders related to the pandemic and did not sufficiently protect inmates, jail staff and the public. As part of the agreement, the jail is required to promote social distancing, require and distribute masks to all people in the jail, conduct coronavirus testing pursuant to U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines, and isolate medically vulnerable inmates while monitoring them regularly. The jail also agreed, with limited exceptions, to prevent inmates charged with misdemeanor, municipal or petty crimes from being held in the facility. The county sheriff will also be required to regularly advise officers to minimize custodial arrests.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Nearly two dozen inmates at the state’s only women’s prison recently tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a partial lockdown, Department of Correction officials said. There were 14 infected inmates with symptoms at York Correctional Institution in East Lyme and another nine inmates who tested positive but had no symptoms as of Wednesday evening, department spokeswoman Karen Martucci said. All of them were in medical isolation, she said. The partial lockdown at York, which houses nearly 500 inmates, includes restrictions on prisoners’ movements and a temporary suspension of in-person, non-contact social visits. Martucci said inmates are still able to use the phone and take showers every day, and free video conferencing has been made available. The facility was undergoing a deep cleaning, officials said. Statewide, more than 290 inmates and nearly 140 employees currently have COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, nearly 1,750 state inmates have tested positive for the virus, and eight have died, according to the latest Correction Department data. More than 9,200 inmates are detained in state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Several key indicators of the spread of COVID-19 in the state have reached or eclipsed spring records. Delaware on Thursday reported 754 new cases, the most ever in a single day. The greatest single-day case count in the spring was 487 on May 10, and that number has been surpassed nine times this fall. The seven-day average of daily confirmed cases has set a record in each of the past five days, climbing to 555.7 on Thursday. The recent spike cannot be solely attributed to increased testing. Although Delaware has administered about 7,000 tests per day over the past week, a dramatic increase over the roughly 1,500 tests performed daily in May, the percentage of tests that are positive is rising, too. The state reported a seven-day average of 8% of tests that are positive as of Nov. 30, the highest it’s been this fall. A week earlier, the figure was 6.1%. There are currently 277 people hospitalized in Delaware due to COVID-19, the most since May 12. At his weekly COVID-19 press briefing Tuesday, Gov. John Carney said the state is considering implementing new restrictions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the second time in a week, D.C. has tallied more than 300 new cases of the coronavirus in a single day, WUSA-TV reports. Thursday marked only the third time ever that the district’s daily COVID-19 case count has exceeded 300. And for the first time ever, the city is now averaging more than 200 new cases of the virus a day. There are also indications that the city’s coronavirus testing capacity hasn’t been able to keep pace. The average positivity rate for tests has been steadily rising and now sits at 5.6%, 2.6 percentage points higher than it was a month ago. Since Nov. 21, average wait times for test results have increased by a full day. Some of that may ease as labs work through the glut of tests from the Thanksgiving holiday, but since labs nationwide are reporting difficult keeping up with testing demand, it’s likely wait times will remain elevated for the near term.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Residents in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities will be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine when the state begins receiving it later this month, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The Republican governor’s priorities, announced in in a video Wednesday evening, largely reflect the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We want to get as much vaccine for our citizens as possible, but we know we will not, nor will any state, have enough to vaccinate everyone right off the bat,” DeSantis said in the three-minute video. He said long-term care residents are most vulnerable to the virus. Through Tuesday, there have been 7,376 confirmed deaths from the virus among residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Overall, COVID-19 is blamed for more than 19,000 deaths in Florida and more than 1 million confirmed infections. On Thursday, the state reported 10,870 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 100 new deaths from COVID-19. There were 4,280 people hospitalized, up 75 from the day before.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of some of the state’s hospitals told Gov. Brian Kemp in a meeting Wednesday that they’re seeing increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, although they said in some cases those infected with the coronavirus do not appear as gravely ill as patients who were hospitalized in earlier waves. The Republican governor continued to express optimism about Georgia’s level of infection compared to other states, as well as about vaccines on the horizon. But some hospital leaders warned that they expect things to keep getting worse, while many said that they struggle to hire nurses and that staff members are exhausted nearly nine months into the pandemic. “I think it’s important for all of us to stay grounded that this third surge is very different than the first and the second ones,” said Bryce Gartland of Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare. “This one is much more insidious in nature. It’s much more building in nature.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A seniors advocacy group has called on the state Department of Health to release more information about nursing home inspections after a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans home caused at least 27 deaths earlier this year. Kokua Council asked the state to put all its inspection reports of long-term care facilities on the health department’s website. The inspection report for the Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home, where at least 71 residents and 35 employees were infected with the virus, has not yet been made public. The facility had been fined twice since 2018 for health violations. The owners of Yukio Okutsu were accused of improperly restraining residents who did not require restraints, failing to adequately supervise residents showering, serving expired food, allowing a resident to fall off a bed and break a hip, and incidents in which staffers accidentally caused minor injuries. Several residents were found to have left without supervision, including one case in which a resident in a wheelchair was found 3 miles away before anyone realized the resident was missing, according to a 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services inspection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Residents will have increased access to broadband service following a state investment of nearly $50 million in federal coronavirus recovery funds. Idaho paid for 102 projects with the money, which will connect about 40,000 Idaho households to broadband service, Boise State Public Radio reports. The state funded projects to provide free wireless internet in schools and public spaces, including downtown areas and parks, plus more than 50 rural libraries. A report by the Pew Research Trusts said Idaho was one of a handful of states without a broadband grant program before the pandemic. Georgia Dimmick, disaster recovery coordinator at Region IV Development in Twin Falls, helped several communities apply for broadband grants over the summer. Eden, a community of 400 residents in Jerome County, received nearly $3 million to bring service to more homes to address the impact of the pandemic and the lack of broadband service for its youth. “There was like 20 or 30 kids out on the front yard at the high school because they didn’t have internet at their house, and they had to get their homework done,” Dimmick said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials reported 10,959 newly confirmed cases of coronavirus illness Thursday and a second consecutive day of near-record deaths. The 192 fatalities from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, matched the toll from May 13, at the height of the initial wave of the disease in Illinois. That total is second only to the 238 reported Wednesday. The Illinois Department of Public Health said some data reported this week was delayed by the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Illinois has now suffered 12,830 deaths among 759,562 coronavirus infections. Hospitalization numbers continue to decrease slowly, good news particularly because the state’s health care front is bracing for another rush of cases in coming weeks after Thanksgiving travel and congregations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As the state faces a longer stretch of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths, the governor and top state health official on Wednesday pinned improvement on personal responsibility and the looming first arrival of vaccines rather than reinstating more statewide precautions. Nearly all of Indiana remained in the greatest-risk categories for coronavirus spread in a state health department update that also showed a new high for average daily COVID-19 deaths for the state. Health officials across the state are worried about hospitals being overwhelmed by the growing number of severely ill patients and a possible new surge tied to Thanksgiving gatherings last week. Indiana hospitals were treating more than 3,400 COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday – about a 350% increase since late September, when the state’s steep increase in hospitalizations and deaths began.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state added another 70 deaths Thursday to the tally of people who died with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours – the largest one-day increase since the pandemic arrived in the state. The state has reported 2,519 total deaths related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That was an addition of 2,449 since Wednesday, according to the state’s Coronavirus.Iowa.gov website. Prior to Thursday, the largest one-day death increase was 47, which was reported Nov. 25. Although the deaths were reported since Wednesday, none occurred in December. Since noon Monday, an additional 107 deaths in November have been reported, bringing that month’s total to 718. The majority of the 70 newly reported deaths – 61 – happened in November, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Eight additional deaths were reported from October. The earliest death that is newly reported is from Aug. 26.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County on Thursday rejected part of the new federal and state guidelines for shortening the time people are quarantined after they’re possibly exposed to COVID-19. New guidance Wednesday from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people who’ve been exposed to coronavirus and show no symptoms but don’t get tested can end their quarantines after 10 days, instead of 14. The new guidance also said a person without symptoms who tests negative can end a quarantine after seven days. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment adopted that guidance, though its top administrator, Dr. Lee Norman, said it is still urging people to remain quarantined for 14 days. Shawnee County will allow people without COVID-19 symptoms who’ve not been tested to shorten their quarantines to 10 days, Dr. Gianfranco Pezzino, the county’s health officer, said Thursday. But he said it will not allow people who’ve tested negative to leave quarantine after seven days. Pezzino said the testing system is stressed in the county, home to Topeka, and the county does not want to overload it. Also, he said, the spread of COVID-19 remains “uncontrolled” locally.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus surged Wednesday after another daily record, and some hospitals are being stretched “to the brink” as virus cases escalate, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear reported 37 more virus-related deaths, eclipsing the previous record of 35 deaths posted Tuesday, as the state’s total death count since the start of the pandemic approached 2,000. The latest deaths included people ranging in ages from their 40s to their 90s. Six were under the age of 60. Back-to-back days of record virus deaths underscored the need for people to wear masks and follow other health guidelines, the Democratic governor said. He recently announced new restrictions on in-person gatherings at restaurants, schools and event venues to combat the virus. Those actions sparked criticism from Republican lawmakers, business owners and private schools. “We are not surrendering. We are fighting back,” Beshear said Wednesday. “That’s not always going to be popular. It’s going to be difficult.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A health care worker and an academic are warning that testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is being neglected during the coronavirus pandemic. Joseph Olsen, an HIV testing manager at a clinic in New Orleans, told WDSU-TV on Wednesday that the clinic has performed 2,000 HIV tests since the pandemic began. Before the virus outbreak, he said the clinic usually did up to 12,000 tests in a year. “Coronavirus parallels HIV. They do not care who you are; they just do what viruses do and spread,” Olsen said. Some HIV testing sites have closed as clinics shifted to telemedicine during the pandemic, said Meredith Clement, a professor at Louisiana State University’s Health Sciences Center. Olsen said his clinic, Crescent Care, has increased at-home testing kits and is offering walk-up testing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday that the number of doses of the new coronavirus vaccine that the state could receive later this month is disappointingly low. Mills, a Democrat, said Maine is slated to get about 12,600 doses of a vaccine by the middle of December. The vaccine requires two doses, which means the shipment could allow the state to vaccinate some 6,300 people. The people at the front of the line for the new vaccine would be health care workers. Mills called the number of doses “far less than what is needed.” She said the state hoped for closer to 36,000 doses in the initial shipment. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah has said the number of vaccine doses the federal government could ship to the state is a preliminary number that could change.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will receive about 155,000 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine during the first wave of distribution – an amount that will not even cover half of the front-line health care workers who are slated to receive initial immunizations. “That’s a tiny fraction of what we need,” Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday in Annapolis. “It doesn’t get anywhere near what we need in phase one.” He said state officials learned details of the first phase Tuesday. It’s still unclear whether the 155,000 will represent complete doses of two separate injections or individual injections. Hogan said about 50,000 will come from Pfizer and the remainder from Moderna. “The good news is they have vaccines that are years ahead of schedule, and we’ll get some relatively fast,” Hogan said. “The bad news is it’s not enough. So we have some difficult decisions ... about the implementation and rollout of the plan.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A 220-bed field hospital at a sports and convention center in Worcester is scheduled to open Sunday, and the state is already working on establishing a second to care for an expected torrent of coronavirus patients, Gov. Charlie Baker said Thursday. “Field hospitals play a critical role in our preparedness strategy that helps us alleviate pressure on the health care system generally and enable hospitals to focus on non-COVID patients,” the Republican governor said after touring the field hospital set up at the DCU Center in Worcester and run by UMass Memorial Health Care. The visit came a day after the state reported 4,613 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began, with nearly 1,300 patients in the hospital. In addition to all the medical equipment and amenities its needs to care for patients, the Worcester facility also has some features aimed at helping patients dealing with the isolation they often feel because family can’t visit, including common areas and exercise bicycles, said Dr. Eric Dickson, president of UMass Memorial Health Care.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday that her administration may extend portions of a three-week partial shutdown of schools and businesses next week because of the “sheer volume” of coronavirus cases in Michigan. The Democratic governor said no decision had been made, but hospitals can’t be overrun with COVID-19 patients. Although the infection curve has leveled off, it is a “dangerous moment” for the state, she said. “As we get a few more days of information under our belts, we’ll be in a much stronger position to really assess if there are some things that maybe are safer to do,” Whitmer said during a news conference in which she reported continued progress addressing virus-related racial disparities. The state health department’s order closed high schools to in-person instruction, stopped organized sports, prohibited indoor restaurant dining, and closed various entertainment businesses such as movie theaters and bowling alleys. It will end late Tuesday unless extended, which was commonplace for stay-at-home and other restrictions earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz and public safety officials pleaded Wednesday for Minnesotans to follow coronavirus safety guidelines to protect their local police, fire and ambulance services, which have been hit hard by staff shortages amid the surge in cases. Jay Wood, a firefighter from Plato, a town of about 300 people about 45 miles west of Minneapolis, said his 20-person all-volunteer department had to shut down last month because most members had tested positive for the virus or been exposed. One had to be hospitalized. And he said departments large and small across Minnesota face similar challenges. “Just like we preach about fire safety, one little spark can cause a fire. And that’s exactly what happened to us,” Wood said at the governor’s briefing. “COVID-19 sparked an outbreak at the Plato Fire Department. Before we knew it, over three-quarters of our fire department had been affected in one way or another from the virus.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state reported its single-day record of nearly 2,500 new coronavirus cases Wednesday as the state health department issued an advisory saying people should avoid social gatherings, including weddings, funerals, sporting events and in-person religious services. “Where we are in the pandemic right now, just to be very clear, it’s nonessential social activities that are absolutely undermining the health and well-being of our state,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said during a news conference. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has declined to reinstate a statewide mask mandate that expired two months ago, but he has issued mask mandates for 54 of the state’s 82 counties where virus transmission is highest. Many physicians have called on the governor to require masks statewide in public places. Dobbs said Wednesday that the mask conversation “is distracting from the real threat” of spreading the virus through nonessential gatherings. He said people let down their guard and hug others at parties or funerals, often without their faces covered.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: The state plans to bring in hundreds of health care workers from other states to help provide care as already-stretched hospitals prepare for a possible increase in COVID-19 cases resulting from the Thanksgiving holiday. Gov. Mike Parson and Herb Kuhn, president and CEO of the Missouri Hospital Association, announced Wednesday that the state will partner with Vizient, a private national health care company, to recruit up to 760 more health care workers for Missouri. Kuhn said the partnership comes as early data have raised concerns about a possible surge in new COVID-19 cases because of Thanksgiving travel. He said data showed Missourians’ travel for recreation and retail increased an average of 40% daily from Nov. 23 to Thanksgiving Day. The workers will include registered nurses, respiratory therapists and certified nurse assistants. When fully deployed, the plan will add nearly 600 hospital beds to Missouri’s statewide bed capacity, Parson said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday that the state could receive about 9,750 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by drug company Pfizer as soon as Dec. 15. Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for emergency authorization for their vaccines. Once it’s granted, the state is slated to receive thousands of additional doses in subsequent weeks, Bullock said. The state has between 45,000 and 60,000 health care workers and 10,000 residents and staff members at long-term care facilities, who will have first access to the vaccine once it is available. The focus of the first allotment will be health care workers, the governor said. Bullock said during a news conference that the state is slated to use all $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief allocated to the state in the spring, and he called on Congress to pass another relief measure to help the state address economic and health-related challenges once the deadline for spending the original allocation passes at the end of the month. “This is a storm that cannot be weathered without federal support,” Bullock said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: City leaders across the state find they’re left with the onus of whether to require masks as the governor continues to resist issuing a statewide mask mandate in the face of a raging coronavirus pandemic. The Omaha suburb of Papillion was slated to vote Thursday on a proposal to require masks in public buildings, after two consecutive nights of public debate over the proposal. The Papillion Board of Health has recommended the mask mandate, and several medical workers and educators – two professions hit particularly hard by the outbreak – spoke in favor of a mandate at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, the Omaha World-Herald reports. More than a dozen people spoke against the proposal, including laundromat owner Peter Mayberry, believed to be the first person in Omaha ticketed for violating that city’s mask mandate. In Grand Island, police made clear this week that they will enforce the city’s mandate passed last week, including charging violators with public nuisance counts. On Wednesday, the state reported 48 more coronavirus deaths and 2,336 new coronavirus cases.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state reported 48 new deaths from the coronavirus Thursday, marking the deadliest day since the onset of the pandemic. Nevada also reported 2,536 new confirmed virus cases, bringing the statewide totals to 159,532 cases and 2,249 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Nevada is more than a week into what Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak coined a “statewide pause” involving virus prevention measures, with the number of customers businesses can accept and the number of people allowed in gatherings reduced to 25% of fire codes limit. Meanwhile, state officials said they plan to revise their coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to align with interim recommendations that a U.S. Centers for Disease Control committee issued Tuesday. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that the first available doses go to nursing home residents and health care workers. In Nevada, where tourism and hospitality fuel the economy, officials initially assigned residents of long-term care facilities third-tier priority, behind retail workers, teachers, police officers and airport operators.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Senate Democrats are pressing Republican Gov. Chris Sununu to address a COVID-19 outbreak at the New Hampshire Veterans Home that has left 15 residents dead. Senate Minority Leader Donna Soucy and Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, both of Manchester, sent a letter to the governor Thursday saying they are deeply disturbed by what they view as a lack of action at the 250-bed nursing home in Tilton. Since the virus was first detected at the home Nov. 10, 53 residents and 64 staff members have tested positive, and 15 veterans have died. The senators called for the implementation of a plan to prevent further spread of the virus, address staffing shortages and ensure the availability of personal protective equipment. “The staff at the New Hampshire Veterans Home are risking their health and safety simply to do their jobs and care for our veterans,” they wrote. “This is unacceptable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 caseload surged Thursday to levels not seen even during the height of the spring outbreak, with Gov. Phil Murphy and experts warning things could get worse. The state recorded about 4,900 new cases overnight as New Jersey weathers another wave of the outbreak, Murphy, a Democrat, said Thursday in a tweet. The increase comes as weeklong averages of new cases have climbed steadily for weeks. The Democratic governor also reported 64 new deaths overnight, putting the toll at 15,373. Murphy said Wednesday he’s keeping “all options on the table” when it comes to closing parts of the state’s economy again, as he ordered in the spring. He urged people to be especially vigilant with Christmas coming up. “This is Grinch times five. Don’t travel,” he said Wednesday, urging people even to keep their distance from Santa. “Santa’s got to wear a face covering; you’ve got to wear a face covering.” New Jersey’s hospitalizations topped 3,000, Murphy said – a level not seen since May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: City officials are planning a crackdown on illegal street racing and other disruptive driving that has accompanied the coronavirus pandemic and say they’ll seek new regulations to help them. It’s just one of many safety concerns as state health officials on Wednesday reported a record-setting 40 virus-related deaths across New Mexico. Interim Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said Wednesday during a telephone town hall event that the city is expanding late-night patrols in response to reckless driving including racing and will lobby state lawmakers for stiffer penalties for repeat offenders on par with sanctions for driving while intoxicated. He described a rash of complaints about drag racing, loud mufflers and tire-squealing maneuvers. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller believes the speedway phenomenon extends to many communities nationwide. “This is happening all over the country, and it’s because of COVID,” Keller said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city is setting up plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines starting this month, including making sure hospitals have the ultracold freezers needed to store the Pfizer vaccine, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he hopes to receive 170,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Dec. 15, with additional vaccine shipments from Pfizer and Moderna within weeks. Health care workers and nursing home residents and workers will be prioritized in the first wave of vaccinations, Cuomo said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi noted that while the Moderna vaccine can be stored at normal freezer temperatures, the Pfizer vaccine requires ultracold storage at minus 80 degrees Celsius. Chokshi said more than 50 city hospitals either currently have access to ultracold storage or will have ultracold freezers delivered soon, for a total citywide storage capacity of at least 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nYoungsville: The town is planning to hold a Christmas parade despite concerns from county health officials that the event could facilitate the spread of the coronavirus. The Raleigh News & Observer reports Youngsville plans a mile-long parade with up to 300 people watching. Those who are expected to attend include a volleyball team, a plumbing company and a hair salon. The town has faced repeated warnings from the Franklin County Health Department, which warned that COVID-19 cases are reaching record highs locally. The county also said the parade would violate Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order limiting crowds. Town Manager Phil Cordeiro told county officials that Youngsville’s parade falls under the same First Amendment exemption that allowed Raleigh protests this year. He also said the parade is a permitted religious service because it starts in the parking lot of a church. “It’s just been a really bad year, and we’re trying to do something to lighten people’s spirits and give them a little hope,” Mayor Fonzie Flowers told the newspaper. “We don’t want it to be a situation where people don’t feel safe.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State lawmakers decided Thursday to require masks at the Capitol, despite opposition by far-right members of the Republican-controlled Legislature. Senate and House lawmakers approved rules Thursday for the session that convenes Jan. 5. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert and Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said they support a mask mandate at Capitol legislative spaces to help protect lawmakers and the public. A memo written to the Legislature by its lawyers said the lawmakers have the authority to impose restrictions on areas of the Capitol controlled by the legislative branch. Lawmakers who ignore the mandate may be removed by law enforcement and charged with a misdemeanor crime or expelled from the Legislature. Gov. Doug Burgum imposed a mandate in November after months of refraining from such an order, hoping to stem a coronavirus surge that is among the worst in the U.S. and threatens to overwhelm the state’s hospitals.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state will receive close to 100,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine by mid-December, Gov. Mike DeWine announced during a briefing Thursday. The brief but promising details provided the first look at what vaccine distribution will look like in Ohio as the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to rise at staggering rates. The Pfizer drug requires two doses for each person taking the vaccine, meaning the initial distribution will only affect about 49,000 Ohioans. Also Thursday, DeWine made good on earlier threats and vetoed a bill that would restrict the state Health Department’s abilities to issue public health orders during emergencies. The governor said he would provide further details about the state’s vaccine plan Friday but disclosed the partnership the state will have with CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to provide the vaccine to nursing home patients and staff. “This is a huge, logistical operation made particularly more challenging by the necessity of keeping the vaccine super cold,” DeWine said during the briefing. “We’re going to report the best we can about the progress. We’ll be transparent.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine is expected in the state in about 10 days, with health care workers and long-term care providers and residents receiving the first doses, state health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said Thursday. Federal health officials are also working to provide vaccine to long-term care facility staff and residents, according to deputy health commissioner Keith Reed. Frye said emergency use approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer is expected Dec. 11, and 33,000 initial doses should arrive in Oklahoma two or three days later, with shipment of a second, required dose expected about three weeks later. Emergency approval of a similar vaccine developed by Moderna is also anticipated, and about 10,000 doses are expected by the end of December, Frye said. The state’s plan places first responders such as paramedics, police officers and firefighters in addition to the elderly and those at high risk in the second phase of people to receive the vaccine. School students, teachers and staff are in the third phase of those to receive the vaccine, then the general public.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An 11-person COVID-19 outbreak at the Wilsonville office of the Oregon Employment Department will likely cause further delays in handling claims, officials said. The outbreak “will cause real disruptions in our ability to get work at the pace we have been,” said David Gerstenfeld, acting director of the department, which has already been dealing with a backlog. Agency officials said many of the office’s 600 employees will soon work from home. Health authorities have not advised the office to close, Gerstenfeld said. But Gov. Kate Brown’s COVID-19 safety orders require employers to allow work-from-home options when possible. The department has made significant progress in enabling remote work and establishing safety protocols, Gerstenfeld said. He said he expects hundreds of Wilsonville employees to work from home in the future, but some lack adequate internet service. As part of Brown’s proposed budget and policy agenda announced Tuesday, she wants $146 million to replace the employment department’s computer systems and implement a new paid family and medical leave program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hospital beds are filling up, and medical staffs are being stretched to the limit, as Pennsylvania’s health care system copes with a growing number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Nearly half of all hospitals in the south-central region of the state and a third of those in the southwest anticipate staffing shortages within a week, according to the state Department of Health. Nurses in the Philadelphia area say they’re overloaded with COVID-19 patients, limiting the quality of care they can provide. And Pennsylvania’s top health official, Dr. Rachel Levine, said Thursday that she’s worried about modeling that shows the state will run out of intensive care beds this month. More than 85% of the state’s ICU beds are occupied amid an enormous statewide spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations this fall. The health secretary added that she’s even more concerned about hospital staffing. While medical-surgical beds can be converted into ICU beds, the supply of medical workers is “not infinite.” On Thursday, Pennsylvania reported more than 5,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the state’s highest point in the pandemic and up from a statewide average of about 450 at the end of September.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nearly 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines will arrive in the state before the end of month, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Thursday. The term-limited Democrat also declared she wouldn’t be President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for health and human services secretary, dispelling speculation that’s ramped up in recent weeks as Biden forms his Cabinet. “My focus is right here in Rhode Island,” the governor said near the end of her weekly coronavirus briefing. Meanwhile, early reports from the state’s two-week economic “pause” imposed Monday are encouraging, Raimondo said. She said restaurants and bars appear to be following the new rules on their industry, which include reduced capacity limits for in-person dining and shuttering bar areas to patrons. Raimondo also said road travel appeared lighter, and officials have received no credible reports of large parties. She said she’s hopeful the restrictions will lead to a decline in COVID-19 cases in the next couple of weeks. At the same time, Raimondo said, she hasn’t ruled out extending the temporary restrictions, currently slated to run through Dec. 13.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s Republican leaders made no major changes Wednesday to their main House committees, and the group that handles the budget remains stuck with the same problems, only this time it’s looking at steep cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Rep. Murrell Smith of Sumter was reelected chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, two years after House Speaker Jay Lucas wielded his power to make committee assignments for all members and kicked Rep. Brian White off the powerful panel he led for eight years. Smith told his committee they will have to immediately deal with the budget, as economists can’t guarantee that tax and other revenue estimates slashed by the COVID-19 economic downturn will be enough to avoid budget cuts before this spending plan ends in June.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s COVID-19 death toll surged past 1,000 on Thursday, with 38 additional deaths, the Department of Health reported. The additional deaths brought the total to 1,033, and they included a person between 20 and 29 years old, which has been a rarity. So far, three people in that age range have died with COVID-19, while 15,656 in that age range have tested positive for the coronavirus. The new deaths brought December’s total to 87 so far, after a November in which deaths went from 425 to 946. The department reported 1,145 new coronavirus infections, along with 490 newly recovered infections. The number of active infections increased to 15,474. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 rose from 531 to 538. The peak for hospitalizations was set Nov. 10, with 607.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials have expanded a mental health hotline during COVID-19 times to extend support to teachers. The Department of Education says the hotline provides free and confidential support from trained volunteer mental health professionals to people experiencing increased anxiety and stress due to the pandemic. Officials say the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services set up the hotline in May for health care workers and first responders on the front lines of the pandemic. The department partnered with the Mental Health Active Response Team; the Tennessee Association of Alcohol, Drug, and other Addictions Services; and the Tennessee chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. With the expansion, educators are now eligible for the services as well. The hotline is available at 888-642-7886 daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Central time.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Mayor Steve Adler went on vacation to Mexico with family in November as he urged people to stay home amid worsening coronavirus caseloads in Texas, at one point recording a video during the trip in which he told residents back home that now was “not the time to relax.” The trip revealed Wednesday is the latest example of a public official who has pleaded for vigilance in the face of rising cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. seeming not to heed their own guidance. Hours after the story was published, Adler issued a statement apologizing for the trip. “While I violated no orders or guidelines, I regret this travel,” Adler said. “I wouldn’t travel now, didn’t over Thanksgiving and won’t over Christmas. But my fear is that this travel, even having happened during a safer period, could be used by some as justification for risky behavior. In hindsight, it set a bad example, for which I apologize.” The trip to Cabo San Lucas came after Adler hosted an outdoor wedding and reception with 20 guests for his daughter at a hotel near downtown. Adler said the attendees had to take a rapid COVID-19 test and maintain social distancing. He acknowledged, however, that although masks were distributed at the wedding, all guests were “probably not” wearing them all the time.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that the state plans to prioritize front-line health care workers after it receives its first round of coronavirus vaccine doses that could arrive as early as mid-December. The first doses in Utah will go to front-line workers such as doctors and nurses in emergency departments, urgent care facilities and COVID-19 units, as well as housekeeping workers, said Dr. Jeanmarie Mayer, chief of infection prevention at the University of Utah Health hospital. “It’s just so incredibly important to make sure that we keep our health care systems intact and able to care for the most vulnerable in our populations,” Mayer told reporters. Public health experts have warned that if people do not follow masking and social distancing guidance, COVID-19 hospitalizations will further overwhelm the state’s already strained health care system. In Utah, 1 in 173 people was diagnosed with COVID-19 over the past week, and the state is ranked eighth in the country for new cases per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s tax department is forecasting a 9% increase in education property taxes, mostly because of the pandemic. The forecast assists lawmakers and administration officials in planning for a budget and gives them a preview of education tax yields for homeowners and the non-homestead tax rate for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The forecast indicates a lack of spending at local stores, restaurants and hotels translates to an estimated $40 million shortfall in the education fund. Tax Commissioner Craig Bolio called it “one of the largest-single year increases in the average homestead rate in the last decade.” But he said the numbers aren’t final, and the economic picture could improve depending on how the state does in curbing the virus and getting more people back to work. “The governor and administration do not believe this is a tenable tax increase for Vermonters who are working hard to recover from the pandemic, nor for the Vermont economy which continues to struggle due to the pandemic-related disruption,” Bolio wrote.\n\nVirginia\n\nRustburg: Officials in Campbell County have passed a resolution expressing opposition to the governor’s new safety guidelines that aim to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Lynchburg News & Advance reports the county’s supervisors on Tuesday declared it to be a “First Amendment sanctuary.” The resolution is considered mostly symbolic and is similar to a Second Amendment sanctuary resolution passed by the county’s board more than a year ago. Gov. Ralph Northam’s executive order limits indoor and outdoor gatherings to no more than 25 people. It also directs restaurants and bars to halt alcohol sales at 10 p.m. and close by midnight. The county’s resolution claims the Democratic governor’s mandate is in violation of the state’s constitution and seeks to oppose enforcement of his executive order. It asks the sheriff’s office to “not assist any state law enforcement officer, state health agent or federal agent” attempting to enforce the order. The Virginia Department of Health enforces the governor’s mandates, not local law enforcement agencies.\n\nWashington\n\nLittle Boston: A COVID-19 outbreak on the Port Gamble S’Klallam Reservation in North Kitsap has spread to at least 13 people and forced nearly 50 close contacts into isolation. The tribe said in an announcement that the 13 positive tests had come over the weekend through Tuesday, saying nearly 10% of the households on the reservation needed to quarantine. “It did not need to be this way,” the tribe said in a pointed update on its Facebook page, connecting the spread of the virus on the reservation to group gatherings during Thanksgiving week. “This past week, people got complacent,” the announcement said. “They had dinners. They got together with loved ones. We’re now seeing the consequences of those actions. If you’re one of the affected, this notice is not meant to shame – we hope for a quick and uneventful recovery. It is important though that we all, as a community, learn from where we find ourselves right now.” The tribe was an early adopter in setting up a community testing site in May and has continued to test its employees and community members since then.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state debuted a partnership for free home-based saliva coronavirus testing Wednesday. The testing kits from Vault Health can be requested on the state’s coronavirus website. Results are expected in 24 to 48 hours after individuals send their test sample back in the mail. Officials said there are no restrictions on who can request the tests. Gov. Jim Justice announced the news as the state reported 20 additional deaths linked to COVID-19, bringing the total to at least 778 deaths. There were 678 new confirmed cases, for a total of 49,905. Forty-seven of the state’s 55 counties are classified with the state’s most severe infection rate with 25 or more positive cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said he expects the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer to reach the state Dec. 14. He acknowledged that a focus on increasing testing in the state has not brought the outbreak under control.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers told President Donald Trump and the state’s congressional delegation Thursday that Wisconsin needs $466 million by April to pay for vaccine distribution, coronavirus testing, contact tracing, hospitals and a public health awareness campaign. Evers, a Democrat, made the plea amid talks with Republican state lawmakers on COVID-19 proposals but with no agreement or immediate action in sight. Evers also wrote to the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking that Wisconsin be prioritized for vaccine distribution so the state’s 450,000 health care workers can be vaccinated. Wisconsin is expected to receive nearly 50,000 doses of vaccine within weeks. The state is nearing 400,000 total cases of COVID-19 even as new positive tests begin to slow from a peak in mid-November. There were 4,618 new cases reported Thursday, bringing the total to 399,708 cases. There were 60 new deaths, for a total of 3,562.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An oil and gas stimulus program in the state has shown promising initial results in helping operators recover from the economic downturn caused in part by the pandemic, officials said. Gov. Mark Gordon created the Wyoming Energy Rebound Program to give companies money needed to complete specific projects placed on hold because of the pandemic, including plugging and abandoning wells, as well as drilling uncompleted wells, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Republican governor announced last month that he would dedicate $15 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to create the program. He later doubled the amount to $30 million in response to high demand. “This is a great and appropriate use of CARES Act money to respond to the devastating effects of the pandemic on our economy,” Randall Luthi, chief energy advisor to Gordon, said in a statement. “The oil and gas operators responded quickly and they need to act quickly in the near future.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/07/anti-pipeline-push-lynyrd-skynyrd-gopher-frogs-news-around-states/118674524/", "title": "Anti-pipeline push, Lynyrd Skynyrd: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/07/grateful-dead-greta-dakotas-aerial-ant-attack-news-around-states/40276147/", "title": "Grateful Dead, Greta in Dakotas: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Educators say they’re concerned about a new reading test they say could result in thousands of third graders in the state being held back. Al.com reports the test is the result of a new state law that requires third graders to read on grade level starting with the 2021-22 school year in order to advance to fourth grade. Critics say the testing will result in students with disabilities and English language learners to be held back. At a recent meeting in Montgomery, Decatur Superintendent Michael Douglas said that if teachers are not properly trained, it could become a “big train wreck.” This year’s first graders have three years to get ready for the make-or-break reading test.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency has rejected an iconic Alaska tree for listing as a threatened species due to climate warming. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday that yellow cedars do not warrant additional protections because trees affected by warming grow in areas representing less than 6% of the overall area where they can be found. A spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity calls the yellow cedar decision reckless. Shaye Wolf says yellow cedars face harm from climate change and logging. Yellow cedar trees can live more than 1,000 years. Alaska Native people have used wood and bark for canoe paddles, totem poles, baskets and backing in blankets. Yellow cedar’s shallow roots rely on snow for protection, and warming has made them vulnerable to freezing.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city celebrated the grand reopening of the Piestewa Peak trailhead’s new and upgraded amenities Friday morning. The event featured a tribal blessing from the Gila River Indian Community, along with remarks from Phoenix officials and members of the Hopi Tribe. The ceremony ended with a ribbon-cutting opening the new 104-foot-long pedestrian and vehicle bridge. The trailhead improvements included renovated parking lots that doubled the amount of parking at the trail, an 84-ton bridge connecting the parking lots to improve traffic flow, and access to trails. The summit was renamed Piestewa Peak in 2003 after fallen soldier Lori Ann Piestewa, who was the first Native American woman to die in combat.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Department of Human Services has temporarily taken over three more nursing homes after complaints were made about how they were being run. The agency previously put the private operator’s other two nursing homes into receivership. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that Facebook posts tipped off DHS about potential problems with resident care, payroll and the purchasing of supplies, which led state inspectors to visit the five locations. While the state is the temporary receiver, it will ensure that the homes remain open, that residents are taken care of and that employees are paid until DHS is assured the homes are operating as they should. No residents are expected to be moved.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A bronze sculpture that mysteriously disappeared from the Los Angeles Central Library 50 years ago has returned to its original home. One of three panels of the Well of Scribes was unveiled at the downtown library Friday, the Los Angeles Times reports. The sculpture depicting writers from different cultures vanished in 1969 when the library underwent a renovation. The story of its disappearance was revived in Susan Orlean’s 2018 novel “The Library Book,” which inspired Alta magazine’s managing editor to investigate its whereabouts. An article published in the magazine’s July edition caught the attention of an antiques dealer in Arizona who bought the panel from a woman for $500 years earlier. City Librarian John Szabo says the discovery has given him hope the other two panels might turn up one day.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Real estate experts say a state agency has left an office building unoccupied for about a decade, representing millions in lost potential revenue. The Denver Post reports the five-floor Capitol Hill building is one of three owned by the state Public Employee Retirement Association, which manages the retirement fund for about 600,000 current and former public employees and retirees. Officials say the agency has lost $1.8 billion on investments in 2018, and the losses cost the workers who pay into the agency and the retirees who receive benefits. City appraisers say the 40,000-square-foot building would be worth about $8 million in a sale. An agency spokesperson says officials have been looking for a tenant for more than two years but have been unsuccessful.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The educational group that owns the B-17 bomber that crashed at an airport, killing seven people, says it is suspending flights and its Wings of Freedom Tour for the remainder of the year. The Collings Foundation said Friday that the decision comes in the wake of Wednesday’s tragic crash. The plane carrying 13 people crashed and burned after experiencing mechanical trouble on takeoff from Bradley International Airport. The foundation says its flight team is cooperating with officials to determine the cause. The propeller-driven 1945 B-17 Flying Fortress was part of the foundation’s extensive Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display. The group says it will refund tickets for flights through December.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The City Council president is pressing criminal charges against a man who regularly criticizes her and other officials at public meetings. Dion Wilson was arrested at his home Wednesday on misdemeanor charges of harassment and disorderly conduct. Court documents show City Council President Hanifa Shabazz told police she feared for her safety. Wilson is free pending a December arraignment, but his release conditions bar him from entering the city government building. Wilson says his arrest is an overreach of power and an attempt to silence him. A board member for the Delaware Coalition for Open Government called Wilson’s arrest an outrage. At one council meeting last month, Shabazz prevented Wilson from speaking during public comments, and Wilson responded with profanity.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A public psychiatric hospital has been without drinking water for more than a week. News outlets report bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease were found in the water system of St. Elizabeths Hospital last month, leading staff and patients at the district-owned facility to rely on bottled water. The District Department of Behavioral Health director, Barbara J. Bazron, says no one has shown any signs of illness as a result of the bacteria discovered during a routine water supply test. Emergency protocols were put into place, and staff and patients are now using substitutes for running water, including wipes and body wash spray. Despite the problems first reported by the Washington City Paper, St. Elizabeths continues to admit patients.\n\nFlorida\n\nBig Cypress National Preserve: Officials say trappers have captured a record-setting python as part of a growing effort that encourages hunters to remove the invasive snakes from the Everglades. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says the 18-foot, 4-inch female python weighed 98 pounds and 10 ounces. A statement by the Fish and Wildlife Commission says it was the largest snake captured by the new Python Action Team and the largest ever captured at the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of Miami. The agency says it is the second-largest python ever caught in the wild in Florida. The commission says hunting female Burmese pythons is critical because they add between 30 and 60 hatchlings each time they breed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Tyler Perry officially christened his massive new film studio Saturday, beaming as his fellow entertainment industry luminaries descended on Atlanta and strode a red carpet to his sprawling complex for an opening gala. The attendees warmly greeted Perry, a man who had once been homeless and yet now helmed his own studio, one of the nation’s largest. Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, Cicely Tyson, Samuel L. Jackson, Halle Berry and others helped Perry christen his new facility, a 330-acre studio that once served as a Confederate army base. Winfrey praised Perry and said the new studio head is a force to be reckoned with. Jackson pointed to Perry’s vision as the key to his ascent. Tyler Perry Studios has 12 soundstages, each named after seminal black actors and actresses.\n\nHawaii\n\nNahiku: Scientists have used helicopters to launch an aerial attack against an invasive ant species on east Maui. Maui News reports the Maui Invasive Species Committee and Hilo-based Hawaii Ant Lab sprayed low-toxicity gel bait from helicopters Tuesday to curb the stinging pests in the Nahiku forest. Scientists say 15 helicopters were part of a joint-island effort to treat an infestation of little fire ants called one of the worst invasive species in the world. Crews from Maui and Hawaii island say the spray combines food-grade ingredients and a birth control-like growth regulator. Experts say the South American native insects are smaller than the average friendly ant and have a burning sting that can permanently blind cats and dogs and cause irritation for humans.\n\nIdaho\n\nWinchester: A public health advisory is in place for Winchester Lake after testing indicated elevated levels of toxins produced by blue-green algae. The Lewiston Tribune reports health officials and the Nez Perce Tribe have urged people to use caution when spending time in or near the water. A release from Public Health Idaho North Central District says blue-green algae is a natural part of Idaho’s water bodies. But when temperatures rise, their populations can bloom, and toxic chemical compounds can be released into the water. Those spending time near surface water with a health advisory are urged to avoid swimming, wading or other activities. Health officials say people should not drink or cook with water containing a bloom.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is spending $850,000 of his own money to continue renovations to the historic Illinois Governor’s Mansion, including fixing tile on the first floor, remodeling guest rooms and modernizing current plumbing. The estate built in 1855 will be closed for tours until Nov. 23 due to the latest overhaul. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the billionaire businessman has given at least $3.45 million of his money to cover government costs that include doubling some salaries. The Democrat broke campaign finance records last year by giving his own campaign $171.5 million. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner, also a wealthy businessman, launched his own privately funded $15 million mansion makeover, leading a fundraising campaign that started in early 2015.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Bureau of Motor Vehicles is putting on hold a policy allowing nonbinary gender designations on driver’s licenses while officials develop new formal regulations for gender changes on state-issued IDs. The agency had proposed allowing such changes with an amended birth certificate or a special state Department of Health form signed by a doctor. State Attorney General Curtis Hill stalled the proposal last month, citing insufficient public notification. The BMV says it is working on a revised proposal and set a public hearing for Nov. 15. BMV spokeswoman Susan Guyer tells The Journal Gazette it will continue processing male-to-female and female-to-male gender modifications with a doctor’s statement.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court has apologized to a legislative committee investigating the break-ins at courthouses and the court system’s own state-owned building as part of a cybersecurity vulnerability test. Speaking Friday to the Senate Government Oversight Committee, Mark Cady acknowledged mistakes as the judicial branch worked to protect confidential information and promised they wouldn’t happen again. Senators criticized several judicial branch administrators for signing contracts with a cybersecurity company without properly vetting them for inconsistencies or errors. Information technology employees say they believe the men who burglarized the court buildings acted outside the scope of the contract. Sen. Tony Bisignano called it a “covert stupid operation” that put law enforcement officers and the men involved in the break-ins at risk.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has joined a legal battle to save a federal program that shields young immigrants from deportation. Kelly’s move Friday puts the Democratic governor and Republican Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt on opposite sides of a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly signed onto written legal arguments opposing President Donald Trump’s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Kelly joined Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and the Democratic attorneys general of Michigan and Nevada. Schmidt has joined 11 other GOP state attorneys general and Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in a court filing arguing that the DACA program established by President Barack Obama wasn’t lawful.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell says he’s working to secure sufficient funding for the state’s military posts, including a new middle school at Fort Campbell. The Trump administration announced plans last month to divert $3.6 billion in funding from military projects like schools to pay for the construction of a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. McConnell made the remarks Friday during an appearance in Louisville with Defense Secretary Mark Esper where they highlighted the importance of Kentucky’s military installations to national security. McConnell called last month’s announcement a “bump along the way” to getting the sufficient long-term military funding and pledged to “fully fund a new middle school at Fort Campbell, something they’ve wanted for years and I secured in the first place.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A southeastern Louisiana university has released its first branded beer. Nicholls State University launched Colonels Retreat, a lager brewed by Bayou Tech Brewery, at Saturday’s football game against Central Arkansas. The Houma Courier reports that the first pours came at an alumni tailgate on the Thibodaux campus, for members of the Nicholls Alumni Federation who were 21 and older. Colonels Retreat sales will bring in revenue for the university and the alumni association. Nicholls’ lager is the latest in a trend of beers named for or licensed by Louisiana colleges and universities. Arnaudville-based Bayou Teche Brewing also brews branded beers for McNeese State and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Universities with licensed beers from other brewers include Tulane, Northwestern State and the University of Louisiana at Monroe.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s Supreme Court says Goose Rocks Beach belongs to the town of Kennebunkport and not the beachfront landowners who spent years fighting to keep the public off the beach. Goose Rocks Beach landowners contend Maine law says waterfront property extends all the way to the low tide mark, allowing them to exclude the public. However, there’s also a long-established public rights doctrine from 1674 that allows the use of the “intertidal zone” between the high and low tide watermarks for fishing, fowling and navigation. The Maine Supreme Judicial concluded there’s “no doubt” that beachfront owners failed to establish ownership. The beach has been the subject of litigation for a decade.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s top prosecutor has begun asking judges to throw out nearly 800 convictions she says were tainted by officers linked to a corruption scandal. The Baltimore Sun reports State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby’s review found 790 criminal cases handled by 25 city officers whom she says she has reason to distrust. Mosby updated the number of officers being scrutinized Friday, saying it could fluctuate as her office investigates. Eight members of the Gun Trace Task Force were convicted of racketeering crimes and sentenced to prison. Many of the other 17 officers cited by Mosby’s office were named in testimony during the federal trial, though not necessarily charged with crimes. Mosby’s office hasn’t disclosed all their names because of ongoing federal investigations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nConcord: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has recommended replacing the two narrow and often backed-up bridges that carry vehicular traffic across the Cape Cod Canal. The Corps, which oversees the Bourne and Sagamore bridges, issued its draft report Thursday following a study that weighed the advantages of rehabbing the nearly 85-year-old bridges versus replacing them entirely. The Corps determined replacing them would be more cost-effective than paying $1.5 billion to rehabilitate them. The report recommends replacing the four-lane bridges with new, wider four-lane structures that include auxiliary acceleration-deceleration lanes, plus bike and pedestrian access. Construction of new bridges, in roughly the same location as the current bridges, could start as early as 2025.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city is receiving $9.7 million from the federal government to help remove lead from homes, the largest single amount awarded to a local government. The Detroit News reports the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the lead abatement grants Thursday at nonprofit Urban Neighborhood Initiatives. Mayor Mike Duggan says the subsidies will help 450 homeowners living in zip code 48209, a southwest neighborhood with 75% of its houses constructed in the 1940s or earlier. The Detroit Health Department will run the program and post information for prospective homeowners in January. Duggan says Detroit expects to start work on the first set of houses before the end of spring.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The mother of a girl whose videotaped arrest sparked an angry backlash on social media says her 13-year-old daughter has a mental illness, and officers were overly aggressive in handling her. Prosecutors filed a juvenile delinquency petition Friday charging the girl with fourth-degree assault in connection with her arrest in St. Paul last week. Police say the incident began after the teen violated a no-trespassing order, fled officers and ultimately resisted arrest. But the girl’s mother, Davida Conover, says her daughter was “basically treated like an animal.” Video of the arrest recorded by a witness shows three white officers struggling to arrest the black teen as she screams and thrashes on the floor of a UPS store. Conover has accused the officers of racial bias.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The state’s blue guitar license plates are disappearing, and any vehicle that still wears one come January will be an easy target for a traffic ticket. By the end of the year, “Lucille” will be retired. The blue-and-white plate honored musician B.B. King and his guitar Lucille. But many people in the state aren’t crazy about the “dirty” brown color and design of the new plate. There’s a fix for that – actually, more than 225 options – and nearly 1 in 4 of Mississippi’s 2.9 million vehicles now sports a specialty plate or a vanity plate with a personalized message. Sales of specialty plates are up 10% from January through August compared to the same time last year, says Kaitlin O’Dougherty, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Revenue.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A federal judge has declined to block a state law that bans companies from labeling plant-based meat products or meat substitutes as meat. U.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan Jr. said last week that he wouldn’t issue a preliminary injunction to stop Missouri agriculture officials from enforcing the law, which says a product cannot be marketed as meat unless it comes from an animal with two or four feet, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Turtle Island Foods, which produces Tofurky products, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Good Food Institute appealed the decision Wednesday. They argue the law violates their free-speech rights. Gaitan wrote in his opinion that Tofurky would not be affected by the law because its labels disclose that its products are plant-based or grown in labs.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. forest officials have announced details of a proposed land exchange that would increase public access. The Billings Gazette reports the Custer Gallatin National Forest proposed trading portions of forest lands to the Crazy Mountain Ranch, Rock Creek Ranch and Wild Eagle Mountain Ranch. The deal includes 5 square miles of forest lands for about 6 square miles of private land. Officials say entire sections are privately owned, and the forest has worked to consolidate its holdings since 1934. Forest officials say exchange discussions have been underway since 2005 but picked up recently after dedicating more staff to the project. The Forest Service is expected to host an open house in Livingston on Oct. 23 to discuss the proposal.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Proposed social studies standards for the state’s schoolchildren would encourage them to look at history from multiple perspectives. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the draft proposal was written by a group of Nebraska educators and suggests what students should know about and be able to do in history, government, civics, geography and economics. If the standards are approved by the Nebraska State Board of Education next month, school districts must adopt the standards or their own of equal or greater rigor. The new proposal emphasizes the importance of understanding different points of view and provides examples to emphasize the point. It mentions, for example, the different perspectives among religious, racial and ethnic groups, immigrants, women, LGBTQ people and Native American nations.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed amendment to a county ordinance has renewed a debate about the rights of sex workers in the state. The Las Vegas Sun reports the Nye County ordinance would restrict the hours when legal prostitutes are permitted to leave licensed brothels. Officials say workers would be prohibited from leaving brothels for more than six hours within a 10-day period. Brothel officials say they are concerned workers could have unprotected sex off the premises. Some current and former sex workers say the ordinance infringes on the rights of legal prostitutes. Nye County Commission officials declined to comment when asked if the ordinance discriminates against or violates the rights of prostitutes. The draft is set to be introduced Oct. 15.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Scholars and die-hard fans of the Grateful Dead will soon gather in the state for a weeklong conference that looks at the cultural impact of the band. Saint Anselm College in Manchester will host “A Long Strange Trip: The Culture of the Grateful Dead” on Oct. 22-25. The event will feature panels and discussions that touch on subjects such as how the iconic band with songs like “Friend of the Devil” and “Terrapin Station” influenced pop culture as well as drug culture. The event concludes with something that the band’s late lead guitarist Jerry Garcia would have loved – a musical jam. Among the speakers will be Thomas Mangan, a filmmaker and executive producer of a four-part documentary on the Grateful Dead, titled “Long Strange Trip.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Marty Small intends on bringing big changes to this city, where yet another political corruption scandal has propelled him to the office he has sought for so long. Small, the City Council president, became acting mayor Friday, a day after Frank Gilliam Jr., a fellow Democrat, admitted stealing $87,000 from a youth basketball club he founded, and resigned. It was the latest spin of the mayoral wheel in this seaside gambling resort, where political corruption has such a long, rich history that HBO created an award-winning TV series about it, “Boardwalk Empire.” As recently as 2007, four of the city’s last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges, and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest. And Small himself was indicted twice – and acquitted twice – of election fraud-related charges.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A tree to be displayed outside the U.S. Capitol building over the holidays is supposed to come from a forest in the state – if the U.S. Forest Service can get an exception from a tree-cutting ban across all New Mexico national forests and one in Arizona. The agency says it’s trying. The ban came in a 2013 lawsuit filed by WildEarth Guardians that accused the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of failing to track the threatened Mexican spotted owl for more than 20 years. A federal judge has OK’d personal firewood permits but sidelined other timber management activities. The Capitol Christmas Tree is scheduled to be cut from Carson National Forest early next month. WildEarth Guardians says the ban wouldn’t prevent that from happening.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is taking most 17-year-olds with offenses out of the adult criminal justice system. The change is effective this month under the second part of 2017 legislation that raised New York’s age of criminal responsibility to 18. The first part of the law addressing most 16-year-olds went into effect last year. New York had been among the last states that automatically prosecuted 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Supporters say incarcerating youth alongside adults is connected with higher suicide rates and increased recidivism. This year’s state budget includes $200 million in funding for programs such as diversion services. Under the legislation, such young people charged with misdemeanors would have their cases tried in family court proceedings.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican lawmakers are defending how they redrew state House districts at the direction of state judges who found lines drawn two years ago were tainted by extreme partisan bias favoring the GOP. The legislators’ attorneys filed a brief Friday urging the three-judge panel that ordered the remap to leave recent changes intact. They are responding to the victors in a partisan gerrymandering lawsuit. Common Cause and state Democrats questioned last week how Republicans redrew nearly 20 House districts last month and asked the court to fix them. The GOP attorneys rejected accusations that lawmakers violated the court’s prohibitions of using partisan data. The judges have a redistricting expert at their disposal to remake some or all of the districts that the legislature approved last month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nCannon Ball: A 16-year-old climate activist who garnered international attention when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations is visiting American Indian reservations in the Dakotas to talk about oil pipelines. Greta Thunberg appeared at panel discussions on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota on Sunday evening and is scheduled to do the same on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota on Tuesday. The Lakota People’s Law Project says Thunberg is concerned about the proposed path of the Keystone XL pipeline and plans to double oil flowing through the Dakota Access pipeline. Thunberg traveled to the United States in August on a sailboat to promote her climate change campaign.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A bill that would require public middle and high school students to take an annual class in suicide and violence prevention training is headed to the state Senate. The bill passed last week by the Ohio House also would require every public school to have a student-led anti-violence club and a threat assessment team composed of school staff. The proposed Safety And Violence Education For Students Act, or SAVE Students Act, would also mandate that schools contract with an anonymous, round-the-clock reporting system to field and report tips about potential safety threats. Republican Rep. Gayle Manning, of North Ridgeville, introduced the legislation in March. She says it aims to reduce social isolation and give schools and students the necessary tools and resources for suicide-prevention and threat-assessment training.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEnid: A woman was shot in the thigh when a dog inside the vehicle with her jumped onto a back-seat console, causing a gun under the console to fire. The Enid News & Eagle reports Tina Springer was in the passenger seat of the vehicle that had stopped Thursday to wait for a train. The yellow Labrador retriever, which belongs to the 79-year-old driver Brent Parks, was in the back seat and jumped onto the folding console. That’s when the .22-caliber handgun under the console went off. Police say cloth from the seat covers could have gotten into the trigger well of the gun, making it discharge. The 44-year-old Springer, who lives in Nash, Oklahoma, and is Parks’ caretaker, was taken to a hospital for treatment. Police say Parks told them the gun isn’t usually loaded.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A newly established pack of wolves has something to howl about. At least four pups have been born to the pack in the western part of the state, where they are still listed as endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday that a photo from a trail camera confirmed the pups’ existence. Their fur gray with cream-colored streaks, three of them were photographed walking on an unpaved road with a larger wolf, with the fourth pup on the other side of the road and farther back. The existence of the pack was officially confirmed only early this year, when it numbered three wolves. The pups are growing fast. Officials with the federal and state wildlife departments say they placed a GPS collar on a pup suspected to be from the pack Sept. 26 in the Umpqua National Forest.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state law is ending a requirement that telephone customers who want to remain on the state’s do-not-call registry have had to renew their listing every five years. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday signed changes to the Telemarketer Registration Act that also allow business phone customers to sign up for the do-not-call list. The legislation requires that robocalls start with a clear way for recipients to opt out of them and that telemarketing voicemails must include a phone number to prevent future calls. It bans telephone solicitation on legal holidays in the state. Lawmakers voted unanimously for the legislation. It takes effect in two months.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: The University of Rhode Island is holding a ceremony to celebrate the opening of a $150 million engineering complex. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, members of the state’s congressional delegation and URI officials plan to attend the event Monday morning at the South Kingstown campus. Voters approved $150 million in bond measures to build the Fascitelli Center for Advanced Engineering and renovate and expand Bliss Hall, which opened in 1928. Work began on the project – the largest construction project in the university’s history – in February 2017. The Fascitelli Center opened for classes in September. It was designed with open spaces to foster collaboration across academic disciplines.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An investigation into law enforcement shooting records found that Greenville County deputies have pulled the trigger more than any other agency in the state. At least 31 times in 10 years, Greenville County Sheriff’s Office deputies fired their weapons at a person. Someone died in 19 of those shootings. In each case, authorities determined the shootings were justified, and no deputies were disciplined. Yet the fallout from each of the shootings lingers. Someone dies or is seriously injured; families grasp for explanations; communities become hesitant to interact with the people sworn to protect them; and officers’ careers – and sometimes their mental state – are changed after a pressure-filled, split-second decision. The investigation found 1 in 8 fatal shootings by law enforcement officers in the state involves a Greenville County deputy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWind Cave National Park: More black-footed ferrets have been released at this southwestern South Dakota park. The National Park Service says 29 ferrets were released into their new home at the park Thursday. The ferrets, which will add to the park’s estimated ferret population of 18 to 20 animals, were raised at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in northern Colorado. Park Superintendent Vidal Davila says the goal is to increase the ferret population and enhance the animal’s genetics that have existed in the park since ferrets were originally reintroduced in 2007. Crews will perform surveys in the next week to monitor the newly released ferrets. Black-footed ferrets are considered among the rarest animals in North America.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: Two bear cubs were rescued after they locked themselves in a van and then honked the horn for help. News reports say security technician Jeff Stokely had parked his van outside a customer’s home in Gatlinburg and went to work. Soon he heard a horn honking and realized it was his van. He went back to the van and was surprised when he saw two small bear cubs locked inside and repeatedly hitting the horn. Stokely says the cubs must have climbed in through the driver-side door and locked themselves inside by hitting the lock button. Stokely took video and photos of the cubs before opening a door to let them out. He says he didn’t see Mama Bear nearby.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: An annual celebration honoring the life of slain Tejano music queen Selena will no longer be held in her South Texas hometown. Officials in Corpus Christi were caught by surprise after learning their city would be losing the Fiesta de la Flor event, an annual two-day festival first held in 2015. The family of Selena Quintanilla-Perez announced Thursday that the festival was moving but didn’t say where it would be held next year. Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb says losing the festival is a blow. The event had a nearly $11 million economic impact on the city this year. Next year’s festival will coincide with the 25th anniversary of Selena’s death. A former president of Selena’s fan club is serving life in prison for killing her.\n\nUtah\n\nAntelope Island State Park: The state has announced plans to restore the bighorn sheep population a year after a respiratory illness outbreak killed more than 100 sheep. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources unveiled plans Thursday to release 35 sheep on Antelope Island in January with the goal of increasing the island’s sheep population to 125. Wildlife biologist Jace Taylor said only 26 out of 150 sheep survived the November 2018 outbreak on Antelope Island, but they were later euthanized. Taylor said officials still haven’t determined how the sheep contracted the disease. State park employees are planning to build a fence on the south end of the island to help monitor and contain the sheep. There are currently an estimated 4,150 bighorn sheep throughout Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A new historic site marker on the Lake Champlain waterfront commemorates the first documented international hockey game. The marker in Burlington’s waterfront park was dedicated Saturday morning. The marker says the first recognized international ice hockey game took place on the ice of Lake Champlain in Burlington on Feb. 26, 1886. Organizers say the game between the Montreal Hockey Club and a local team assembled by the Van Ness House hotel is the first documented ice hockey game between teams from different countries. Montreal won 3-0. The game was part of the Burlington Carnival of Winter Sports in February.\n\nVirginia\n\nBuchanan: Agricultural producers in the state’s southwest are feeling the pain of drought conditions. The Roanoke Times reports most of the Roanoke and New River valleys are experiencing moderate drought, with some parts reaching severe levels. The last areawide rainstorm fell July 23. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 40% of pasture in Virginia in very poor condition. In addition, 67% of apples have been harvested this year, down from 74% during the same time last year. Botetourt County farmer Kevin Marshall says conditions forced him to feed hay to cattle starting in mid-September, two months early. He says he thinks he’ll have enough hay for the winter but won’t make extra cash selling some.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Orange, yellow, white and purple carrots of all shapes and sizes were harvested last week as part of a research trial to test carrots’ genetic resistance to disease. The Skagit Valley Herald reports plant pathologist Lindsey du Toit said 220 breeding lines of carrots were planted in a research plot this summer at the Washington State University Mount Vernon Research Center. She said the goal is to find varieties that have the best nutrition and flavor and are genetically resistant to disease. Volunteers helped harvest the carrots and sort them based on the severity of fungus growing on them. The fungus was added to the soil earlier in the growing season to expose the carrots to disease. Du Toit said the research could help organic carrot growers in Skagit County.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A project to digitize historical newspaper archives has landed another grant. The West Virginia University Libraries’ West Virginia & Regional History Center received a nearly $202,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to keep digitizing newspapers published in the state from 1790 to 1923. It’s the fifth grant contribution from the National Endowment for the Humanities, bringing the group’s total contribution to the center’s efforts to $968,000. The West Virginia center so far has contributed 400,000 pages from more than 50 historic newspapers to the Chronicling America website. The grant will allow another 100,000 pages to be added. This round of newspapers focuses on the Civil War and the West Virginia Mine Wars.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers will issue the state’s first pardons in nine years, invoking his constitutional power to grant clemency to four people. Evers plans to issue the pardons Monday – the first he’s making as governor after he restarted the pardons board in June. Evers’ predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, never issued a single pardon over his eight years as governor. The planned pardons are the first in the state since Democratic Gov.

The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports Gov. Mark Gordon’s wife, Jennie, announced the Wyoming Hunger Initiative’s launch Friday.

Why do we celebrate it? What to ...", "text": "Grab your forks and spoons! The biggest food holiday of the year is almost here.\n\nThanksgiving, the day we give thanks while stuffing our faces, is Thursday, Nov. 23.\n\nThrough the years, Thanksgiving has become known for spending time with family and friends, watching football and the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and, of course, eating good food.\n\nWhile the holiday's origins may not be as accurate as the tales that appear in children's stories or high school textbooks, many see the day as an opportunity to enjoy the company of loved ones and show gratitude.\n\nBut how did Thanksgiving begin? When was the first celebration, and what did they eat? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving 2023?\n\nThanksgiving is on Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023.\n\nOn what day does Thanksgiving fall?\n\nThe holiday falls on the fourth Thursday in November each year.\n\nWhen did Thanksgiving become a federal holiday?\n\nThanksgiving was celebrated independently by colonies and states for more than 200 years, The History Channel reports. Magazine editor and famed author Sarah Josepha Hale became known as the Mother of Thanksgiving for her campaign to establish it as a national holiday.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln answered her call during the Civil War in 1863 and proclaimed a national Thanksgiving would be celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nBut, in 1939, department store mogul Fred Lazarus Jr., concerned that the late Thanksgiving that year would mean less shopping days before Christmas, persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving back a week. For a couple years, the confused nation celebrated the holiday on two different days. To end the confusion, Congress passed a joint resolution, signed by Roosevelt on Dec. 26, 1941, that established Thanksgiving as a federal holiday held on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to the History Channel, the first Thanksgiving celebration is believed to have occurred in 1621.\n\nThe story, historically told from the pilgrim's perspective, is that Plymouth colonists from England shared a meal with the indigenous Wampanoag people to give thanks for a successful fall harvest.\n\nThis lore, however, may not be completely accurate. Most recounts of the event's significance are often overstated, journalist Eryn Dion noted in her reporting.\n\nMembers of the Wampanoag were not formally invited as a gesture of good grace, she says. Instead, the pilgrims became a bit rowdy at their feast and began shooting into the air. Fearing violence, Wampanoag warriors went to see what was occurring, prepared for war (if need be), but saw it was a celebration and eventually joined the feast.\n\nThe second Thanksgiving celebration was held in 1623 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark the end of a long drought that threatened the year's harvest. Days of fasting and feasting would soon become common practice in other New England settlements over the years.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe national holiday began as a celebration of the harvest and other blessings, per the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Thanksgiving, however, has since moved away from its Puritan roots and has become a day to \"symbolize intercultural peace, America's opportunity for newcomers, and the sanctity of home and family.\"\n\nHow is Thanksgiving celebrated?\n\nFor generations, Thanksgiving Day, fondly referred to as Turkey Day, has been celebrated with a large feast consisting of several dishes that vary by culture, ethnicity, state and region. But in most households, you will usually find stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, corn, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, candied yams, macaroni and cheese, pumpkin pie, and the quintessential main dish: turkey.\n\nThanksgiving Day is also often celebrated with football games, parades, and volunteering, BBC Good Food reports. The day after Thanksgiving has also become its own celebration known as Black Friday. During this day, stores nationwide offer extended hours, discounts and special promotions in preparation for the Christmas shopping season.\n\nWhat was eaten at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe History Channel reports that no record exists of the first Thanksgiving menu. Although turkey has become the official mascot of Thanksgiving Day, many historians believe it was likely not a part of the original feast. Here's a list of foods that might've appeared on the table instead:\n\nDeer, likely roasted over a smoldering fire or made into a stew.\n\nLocal vegetables such as onions, beans, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, carrots and peas.\n\nIndigenous fruits such as blueberries, plums, grapes, gooseberries, raspberries and cranberries.\n\nCorn, likely pounded into a thick corn mush or porridge.\n\nVarious types of seafood like mussels, lobster, bass, clams and oysters.\n\nPumpkin custard.\n\nRoot vegetables like turnips and groundnuts.\n\nWhat other countries celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe United States isn't the only country that has a designated holiday for giving thanks. Several other countries and territories also celebrate Thanksgiving. But the dates and reasons for celebrating may vary.\n\nThe countries and territories that celebrate their own versions of Thanksgiving include:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/22/thanksgiving-story-native-american-history/71563811007/", "title": "The truth about Thanksgiving: The Indigenous fight against erasure", "text": "Paula Peters remembers learning about the pilgrims' arrival in North America in elementary school, the backstory behind Thanksgiving Day.\n\nAs the teacher explained how \"friendly Indians\" came to help settlers arriving on the Mayflower, Peters was excited to hear about her own history in the classroom. She's a citizen of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe who grew up to become an independent scholar of the history of the Wampanoag, who have inhabited present-day Massachusetts and Eastern Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years, according to the tribe.\n\n\"As a kid, I'm thinking to myself, 'This is great. She's talking about me, and she's talking about my history,'\" Peters told USA TODAY in an interview this month.\n\nBut her wonder was squashed when a classmate asked what happened to those friendly Indians after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"They all died,\" the teacher said.\n\nPeters remembers being shocked at the erasure of a long history that preceded the Mayflower and the Wampanoag's continuation into today.\n\n\"That's the way that our history was being taught for the longest time, and still is in some areas of the country,\" she said.\n\nWith the upcoming holiday, known by many as Thanksgiving but recognized by Native American communities as the National Day of Mourning, Peters and other Indigenous activists and scholars are advocating for the recognition of the Wampanoag's true history. They say that must be grounded in the fact that they existed far before and long after the pilgrims' first harvest feast.\n\n\"I mean, you can't argue with people coming together and celebrating family, good fortune and being thankful. That's an important holiday to have,\" Peters said. \"But it is also a platform that we as Indigenous people have to step on and remind people of the significance of our story and the myths that are perpetuated by the Thanksgiving holiday.\"\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so expensive?Here's what the data says\n\nThe myth of Thanksgiving\n\nThe Plymouth colonists and the Native American Wampanoag people \"shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the colonies\" in 1621, according to the History Channel.\n\nThe History Channel says that the pilgrims invited the Native Americans to the feast, but Peters said that part is a myth.\n\n\"There wasn't an invitation extended to invite the Wampanoag to come and feast with them,\" she said. \"It was really quite by accident, that there were any shared festivities at all.\"\n\nThe pilgrims were celebrating their first harvest when they fired off muskets repeatedly, a form of entertainment for the settlers.\n\nHearing the blasts, the Wampanoag thought it was a threat. The supreme leader Massasoit Ousamequin assembled a small army of approximately 90 warriors and approached the settlement, much to the surprise of the pilgrims.\n\nAfter deescalating the situation, the pilgrims and the Wampanoag feasted together, though historical texts don't indicate what they might have eaten besides deer hunted by the Wampanoag, as Peters writes in an introduction to \"Of Plimoth Plantation.\"\n\n\"The contemporary holiday perpetuates the myths of the Wampanoag and Pilgrim relations,\" Peters writes in the book. \"It further buries the truths of kidnappings, pestilence and subjugation and ignores the scant details of the tense encounter, while it conjures up Hallmark images of happy Natives and Pilgrims feasting on a cornucopia of corn, pies, and meats, including a fully dressed roast turkey.\"\n\nWhat the Thanksgiving story misses about Indigenous history\n\nPeters said that the years leading up to the arrival of the Mayflower and the first harvest are just as important as what followed. The pilgrims were aided by a couple of Indigenous men who remarkably knew how to speak English, including a man named Squanto.\n\nHis acquired tongue was not a miracle, but a byproduct of tragedy. In 1614, he was part of a group of Native Americans lured onto a ship and and sold into slavery in Spain.\n\nWhen he returned in 1619, his home village of Patuxet had been ravaged by a great plague. In fact, the settlers who came to that same land had to move decaying bodies to make the village that later became Plymouth.\n\nPeters said that story is rarely told, and demonstrates an example of the erasure of Indigenous histories.\n\nThat erasure exists in part to gloss over the ugly parts of American history, said Joseph P. Gone, an enrolled member of the Aaniiih-Gros Ventre Tribal Nation of Montana and a professor at Harvard who researches the intersections of coloniality and mental health in American Indian communities.\n\nThat can have an impact on those whose stories are not being told, he said.\n\n\"We are aware of much more than most people would realize the weight of history and the realities of dispossession that even though these might have happened centuries ago, they linger on in our relationship to America,\" Gone said. \"So we engage today in a constant tussle with American myths about who we were and who we are, in the effort to better imagine a future.\"\n\nMore:New Barbie doll honors Wilma Mankiller, the first female Cherokee principal chief\n\nReconciling the holiday and the history\n\nAlthough the Wampanoag and the pilgrims did not exist as harmoniously as many are taught, many tribal members still take the holiday to celebrate family, Gone and Peters said.\n\nJordan Marie Brings Three White Horses Whetstone of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe in South Dakota started the Truthsgiving Run to bring awareness to Indigenous perspectives and issues.\n\nThe virtual, 4-mile run was created in the summer of 2020 to try to counteract some of the myths around Thanksgiving and the first interactions of between pilgrims and the tribes of first contact, said Whetstone, also the founder and executive director of Indigenous grassroots organizing group Rising Hearts.\n\n\"We really wanted to highlight the truth coming from the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and some of the far more eastern coastal tribes, the first-contact tribes and get their perspectives,\" Whetstone said. \"So (Truthsgiving) was just our way to kind of give a different perspective. But also, how can we do it in a way that's not going to turn people off.\"\n\nThis year's run supports Rising Hearts, ReNew Earth Running, Mashpee Wampanoag and ⁠Wabanaki Public Health & Wellness.\n\nMore:Is commemorating Columbus Day offensive? Why the day's namesake is disrespectful to some\n\nHow to help do better\n\nWhetstone said she hopes that as people sit with the truth, they feel inspired to take action. She suggested the following:\n\nChanging language to reflect the history of the day by calling it \"Truthsgiving\" or \"Thankstaking\"\n\nIncorporating more indigenous foods into Thanksgiving meals\n\nDonate or participate in local action events\n\nWhetstone emphasized that, as Indigenous peoples are not a monolith, many will have different opinions and relationships to the day.\n\n\"It's about becoming an ally and in taking that first step of engaging with Indigenous peoples that you think you know about and you may not at all,\" Whetstone said. \"But getting to learn from them, get their perspective and learn how you can volunteer, or help support or be able to offer maybe any useful resources that they may not have access to.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/11/17/year-some-north-jersey-families-celebrating-thanksgiving-firsts/731943001/", "title": "Celebrating Thanksgiving firsts: Vegans, college homecomings and ...", "text": "The first first Thanksgiving, the one the Pilgrims celebrated in 1621, marked a milestone: their first year in America.\n\nMilestones have been an important part of Thanksgiving ever since.\n\nThey can be happy ones: The first Thanksgiving with the new baby. They can be sad ones: The first Thanksgiving without a grandparent. They can be exciting ones, ones that celebrate the beginning of a new chapter or a new era — just like that original Pilgrim Thanksgiving, four centuries ago.\n\nIn 2016, some 25 Portuguese-speaking immigrants in Newark celebrated their first Thanksgiving in a new country with the Rev. Fernando De Almeida, who invited them into his home. It was a day he — and they — will never forget. \"I asked everybody who doesn't have families here in America to my house,\" says the Rev.

Here are a few that will be playing out this year, at dining room extension tables and kids' tables all over North Jersey. Behold the first Thanksgiving …\n\n...with a new baby\n\nThe table is set and family is gathered around. The scene is similar to last year — with one small change: a new baby. Rutherford’s Courtney Calderon, 36, will know this feeling. She is celebrating her first Thanksgiving as a new mom to her son, Jaxon, 4 months old.\n\nShe says her plans aren’t changing that much this year, except she will be loading “two dogs plus a baby into her car,” she says, to drive to her parent’s house in Manchester. Unfortunately, her husband, Ray, has to work the holiday.\n\nCalderon will try not to dwell on the absence of her husband on Thanksgiving, but celebrate in the excitement as Jaxon meets her older brother, Bobby, and his family for the first time.\n\nStory continues below video.\n\n“He lives in North Carolina with his wife and two kids so we don’t see them too often.” (Jaxon has already met Calderon's younger brother, who lives in Clifton with his wife.)\n\n“Our Thanksgiving usually consists of appetizers, games, turkey, a dance party, nap, dessert, turkey again and football,” she says.\n\nAlthough Jaxon is too young to try any food, he may reveal a smile when he sees one of his family members wearing a turkey hat during dinner, a Thanksgiving tradition that Calderon secretly loves.\n\nAnother holiday tradition: “The next morning we enjoy leftover turkey and cranberry sauce on a biscuit,” Calderon says.\n\nThere's another reason why Thanksgiving now holds a special place in Calderon's heart: Last year, she and Ray revealed to her parents that they were pregnant.\n\n“My parents were so surprised they couldn’t believe it,” she says. “They were beyond happy and excited. Lots of happy tears! It made me so happy seeing them happy.”\n\nAnd what is she thankful for this year?\n\n“My beautiful son, my amazing husband and my parents who I don't know what I would do without,” she says. “I look forward to spending time with family…always.” — Laura Adams Stiansen\n\n…with a high-end vegan menu\n\nSeventeen-year-old Elizabeth Benson has been busy planning her vegan \"Friendsgiving\" menu for some time now. While the Lakeland Regional High School senior may have cooked an all-vegan feast for her friends last year — it was her first Friendsgiving dinner — this year she is going to present a whole batch of new dishes, more sophisticated fare. After all, this Thanksgiving, she can use the cooking skills she's learned over the summer at the culinary school at Passaic County Community College and this semester.\n\n“I’m thinking of making sweet potato casserole with a cinnamon and sugar streusel topping, biscuits stuffed with gravy and mashed potatoes, and a lentil loaf, but I still have to test it out.\"\n\nShe isn't worried. \"My knowledge of cooking has grown over the year,\" she said. \"It's been enhanced.\"\n\nLast year was different, when she invited her four close fiends, three girls, one boy, none of whom are vegan, to her Ringwood home. \"I was nervous,\" she recalled. \"I didn't know how they were going to like it.\"\n\nApparently, the anxiety was unwarranted.\n\n“They loved it,” said Benson, who cooked the lavish buffet meal herself over the course of two days. She plans to do likewise this year.\n\nHer friends, she said, couldn’t believe it was vegan.” In fact they went for second helpings. “They put everything on their plate again,” she said.\n\nBenson does not use any animal products — no meat, dairy, honey, eggs, seafood or even gelatin.\n\nHer meal included: faux-turkey appetizer, made of a guacamole body with finely chopped red, orange and yellow peppers for feathers; fresh baked rolls; green bean casserole with a vegan mushroom glaze; mashed potatoes with a splash of almond milk; bread stuffing flecked with onions, celery and carrots; thick gravy made with vegetable broth and corn starch; pumpkin spice ice cream made with coconut milk and pumpkin puree, plus whipped cream (coconut milk and powdered sugar); and ganache balls rolled in coconut flakes. A friend contributed peanut butter chocolate brownies. And for drinks? Shirley Temples made with cherry juice and ginger ale and Lipton iced green tea.\n\nHer table was decked with orange place mats set atop a crisp white tablecloth, tall wine glasses, white plates, and fresh-cut flowers in the center and lit candles all around.\n\nBenson, who has been a vegan for the past two years and a vegetarian for the previous three, loves to cook. “It’s a stress-reliever,” she said.\n\nShe discovered her love for cooking “through Thanksgiving,” she said. “Cooking for Thanksgiving is an entire family activity. As soon as I was old enough, I joined my brother and sister and parents making the family Thanksgiving dinner.” The family usually has 20 or so guests.\n\nLast year, she said, \"we had so much fun. We were all so stuffed.\" This year everyone may be even more stuffed, given her more advanced cooking skills.\n\n— Esther Davidowitz\n\n...in America\n\nJean Radyn Piard's first Thanksgiving in America is a heartfelt one. He's thankful to be alive.\n\n\"I'm thankful to the Lord, because I'm present now,\" says Piard, 34, who has been in Teaneck since September. \"The people in the United States, in New Jersey, are very nice.\"\n\nHaiti, the country where he's originally from, is a land of rich culture and deep spirituality. But it's not overflowing with creature comforts. Port Au Prince, where Piard is from, is Haiti's capital and biggest city, but there are many who don't have a roof over their heads, and anything — let alone turkey and cranberry sauce — to eat. The devastation wrought by the epic 2010 earthquake and tsunami remains, seven years later, a painful reality. And there is violence.\n\n\"Someone tried to kill me,\" says Piard, who came over here in July on a tourist visa (he's hoping to get a green card). As a professional dancer, teacher, actor, model and makeup artist, it wasn't easy for him down there, he says. \"My situation is Haiti is very bad,\" he says. \"I'm an artist. People are jealous.\"\n\nThat was after he had already survived the 2010 earthquake. \"I said only 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, I don't need to be dead,' \" he remembers. \"I was very scared. I go outside, I hear somebody saying, 'Help! Help!' I see some people with their legs cut off. People were white with all the dust. And the blood on the face. The buildings — down.\"\n\nPiard will be celebrating his first Thanksgiving in the apartment he shares with his aunt, Marie Vinite Piard (\"my second mother\"), her two children, and a niece. \"I will cook for us,\" he says. \"I can't wait.\"\n\nHe's heard a bit about the American Thanksgiving — enough to know that it's about food, and family. \"I know about the turkey,\" he says. \"In the United States, people come and cook their food, their dinner. The date's important for the United States.\"\n\nIn Haiti, there is a somewhat similar festival. Independence Day, Jan 1, marks the anniversary of Haiti's 1804 victory over the French (Haiti was the first black country to gain its independence; Toussaint L'Ouverture is their George Washington). It is a day of bounty.\n\nJoumou, a pumpkin-beef soup, is the commemorative dish. Neighbors share ingredients: those who have celery, onions, carrots or potatoes lend to those who don't. And as with the American Thanksgiving, people provide for the less fortunate.\n\n\"If the homeless are passing, they give them the food,\" Piard says. — Jim Beckerman\n\n...home from college\n\nStephanie Schmidt Rivelli of Wayne is looking forward to a festive Thanksgiving at home with her two sons, her boyfriend Rod, who lives in Butler, and his parents.\n\nTheir first?\n\n“My oldest son Robert went away to college in September,” Rivelli said. “Labor Day weekend. So this will be the first time he’ll be coming home for the holidays. He’s a sophomore. He attended freshman year at CCM [County College of Morris]. Now he’s studying accounting at Rutgers in New Brunswick. He’s about an hour away, but I’ve only seen him once since he left, so we’re all looking forward to this Thanksgiving.”\n\nRivelli said the change was harder on her younger son, Evan, than it was on her.\n\n“He and his brother always used to hang out together, watching sports on TV,” she said. “So that was difficult. In the last couple of weeks it’s gotten easier, but Evan still worries about him. He’ll say, ‘I hope he’s not partying too much.’”\n\nLike most moms, Rivelli hopes that, too. “Still,” she said, “I really encouraged him to go away to school. I thought it would be a good experience for him, an experience I didn’t get to have. He’s 21, and I know he’s having a good time. I assumed we’d talk all the time but the truth is I barely hear from him. We would text here and there. Then last week, I texted, ‘Can you talk?’ And he texted back, ‘Why?’ And I texted back, ‘Because I haven’t seen you in weeks!’”\n\nShe’s not too concerned, though.\n\n“They grow up so fast,” Rivelli said, “but he’s always been mature and level-headed for his age.”\n\nAs for their holiday celebration: “I have to be honest, I’ve had a lot of disappointing Thanksgivings. You spend so much time preparing everything and everyone eats it all so fast!\n\n“This year,” she continues, “will be a little different in another way, too. My boyfriend and I have been eating mostly vegan for the last six months, basically a plant-based, whole-food diet. So I will be making vegan options in addition to the usual turkey and sides. I think Robert coming home, though, will make it special, since I see Thanksgiving, traditionally, as a homecoming. It’s the start of the holiday season. It’s colder outside. The house smells of all that good food and everyone just wants to be close.” — Bill Ervolino\n\n...away from home\n\nInstead of carving a turkey, Rich Lopez, 36, of Hawthorne will be building scenery this year — in South Korea. Lopez works for Blackwalnut, a scenery-building company located in Valley Cottage, New York. \"I’m working with a crew building the scenery for NBC's coverage of the winter games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\"\n\nLast-minute kitchen tips:Oh no! You've burned the bird!\n\nThanksgiving guide:Where to eat, what to make, how to give back and more\n\nRoad Warrior:Thanksgiving's legacy of death\n\nTraditionally, Rich and his wife, Lauren, would go to her parents' house in Mahwah to celebrate the holiday with what he describes as a \"big food spread.\" What makes this year even more special: Lopez and his family have a new addition: his wife's new little niece, Olivia, will be having her first Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's going to be rough — Thanksgiving is a bigger day for me than Christmas,\" he said. \"It’s a time where everyone just stops and hangs with each other, real quality time with loved ones. This year, with a new baby in the family, it’s no doubt going to be an amazing Thanksgiving.\"\n\nHe'll still get to celebrate, though. NBC will be having a Thanksgiving dinner for everyone working on the crew. \"So, it’ll be different, but still a great gesture— I’ve known a lot of these people for a bit now, so it’ll be a good time with the 'makeshift' family.\" — Kristin Coursen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2024/11/08/when-is-thanksgiving-2024-us-what-day-is-thanks-giving-date-nov-28-turkey-dinner-facts-macys-parade/76108124007/", "title": "What date is Thanksgiving Day 2024? When was first holiday and ...", "text": "Thanksgiving, a holiday rooted in healing a bitterly divided nation, happens much later in November this year. Traditionally it's celebrated with lots of food, football games and a parade welcoming the approaching winter holiday season.\n\nEach year, Thanksgiving draws lots of attention and Google searches. Here's a look at what people want to know about the holiday in 2024.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving 2024?\n\nThursday, Nov. 28 is the date of this year's Thanksgiving.\n\nWhen did Thanksgiving become a national holiday?\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln declared a national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. It was a gesture, say historians, meant to reconcile a deeply divided country in the midst of the Civil War.\n\nLincoln wasn't the first president to issue a Thanksgiving proclamation — George Washington did it in 1789. Lincoln's order, however, set a precedent for observing Thanksgiving on the last Thursday in November.\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so late this year?\n\nThanksgiving is traditionally celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, but that wasn't always the case.\n\nBelieve it or not, the U.S. once celebrated two Thanksgivings because of politics\n\nIn 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving up a week to spur retail sales during the Great Depression, according to the National Archives. Sixteen states refused to accept the change and Thanksgiving was celebrated for two years on two different dates. The decision, called \"Franksgiving\" by Roosevelt's detractors, proved so unpopular the president signed a bill in 1941 making Thanksgiving the fourth Thursday in November.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving and why do we celebrate?\n\nThe early history of Thanksgiving can be traced back to the autumn of 1621 in Massachusetts, but historians note there are several misconceptions about what it looked like.\n\nSome Americans cling to a romanticized version of Thanksgiving, in which the Pilgrims invited Native Americans to share a bountiful meal together. That's not entirely true, say historians, and one of several myths about Thanksgiving that paints a deceptively rosy narrative, often overlooking how Native people suffered death, disease, enslavement or forced relocation by white European settlers.\n\nThe Pilgrims did celebrate a three-day harvest festival in 1621, experts say, but there's no record the Wampanoag tribe in Massachusetts received an official invitation to the party, according to the National Endowment for the Humanities. Instead, they might've crashed it.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\nThe Wampanoags, historians believe, arrived ready for battle after hearing the Pilgrims shooting their guns in the air during the festivities. Historical records mention 90 members of the tribe, led by chief Massasoit, then decided to stay for the feast — later bringing the pilgrims five deer to put venison on the menu.\n\nWhatever peace they enjoyed, it didn't last.\n\nRelations between both sides deteriorated by the 1670s to the point of bloodshed. At one point, the severed head of Massasoit's son was mounted on a pike outside Plymouth Colony. Today, not all Native Americans celebrate Thanksgiving.\n\nWas turkey always on the menu for Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to History.com, turkey was not on the menu during the Pilgrim's autumn feast. Instead, they would've likely eaten local seafood such as mussels, lobster and bass. The Wampanoag also brought deer and fruits, including pumpkin.\n\nHow long has pumpkin pie been a traditional part of Thanksgiving?\n\nPumpkin pie was a staple on New England Thanksgiving tables as far back as the turn of the 18th century. Legend has it that the Connecticut town of Colchester postponed its Thanksgiving feast for a week in 1705 due to a molasses shortage, according to history.com.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\nWhat time does the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade start?\n\nThe Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade runs from 8:30 a.m. to noon on Thursday, Nov. 28 and will air on NBC and Peacock.\n\nWhen is Black Friday 2024?\n\nBlack Friday, a time when retail outlets offer many deals and discounts for holiday shoppers, happens Friday, Nov. 29, 2024.\n\nWhat are the remaining holidays in 2024?\n\nMonday, Nov. 11: Veterans Day\n\nVeterans Day Thursday, Nov. 28: Thanksgiving Day\n\nThanksgiving Day Tuesday, Dec. 24: Christmas Eve\n\nChristmas Eve Wednesday, Dec. 25: Christmas Day\n\nChristmas Day Tuesday, Dec. 31: New Year's Eve\n\nHow to move to Canada:Thinking of moving abroad after Election Day?

According to History.com, the Pilgrims had a bountiful corn harvest and celebrated with their Native American allies. The celebration lasted three days.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Continental Congress designated one or more days of thanksgiving per year. In 1798, George Washington gave the first Thanksgiving proclamation by the national government of the United States; in it, he called upon Americans to express their gratitude for the happy conclusion to the country’s war of independence and the successful ratification of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHowever, there wasn't an official day of Thanksgiving in the United States until 1863. At the peak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln set an official day of Thanksgiving on the final Thursday of November to ask God to heal the wounds of the nation.\n\nIs Thanksgiving celebrated elsewhere in the world?\n\nAccording to calendardate.com, Thanksgiving is celebrated in the following countries:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/connections/history/2017/11/23/through-years-thanksgivings-spirit-charity-has-endured/866898001/", "title": "Thanksgiving history shows enduring spirit of charity", "text": "Gerald R. Smith\n\nCorrespondent\n\nWhen I think of Thanksgiving, the first image that comes to mind is Norman Rockwell's wonderful \"Freedom from Want,\" part of his 1943 Four Freedoms paintings.\n\nIt's an idyllic image of Americana with the grandparents bringing the turkey to a table full of traditional dishes surrounded by family and friends.\n\nMany of us still recreate that image each year, and it hearkens to that first Thanksgiving in 1621 when a large assemblage of Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans celebrated for three days after a successful first harvest. During those early years, many of the traditional foods still eaten today were introduced into our culture. It was also during that period when outdoor games around the Thanksgiving and Christmas season were introduced to pass the time.\n\nFrom the time of the American Revolution, an informal Thanksgiving was held at different times in different states, yet most of them occurred in or near November, and President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation set the final Thursday in the month as a time to give thanks. Finally, the fourth Thursday became the date for celebration with a joint resolution of Congress signed by Franklin Roosevelt in 1941.\n\nDespite the non-fixed date of the holiday, what the day represented has stayed remarkably consistent through the years. Many of those customs have been carried from the New England States into our own area. Looking through the pages of the newspapers from the earliest time until today illustrates that despite the changing fabric of history, many of the threads of that fabric have remained and strengthened through the generations.\n\nThanksgiving dinner has been the focal point for the gathering of family and friends, a gathering that brings together those from near and far to sit, eat, enjoy the camaraderie and celebrate the blessings of the year. Whether the the menu includes turkey or any number of other food choices, it's the gathering itself that is the important part of the dinner (save maybe for pumpkin pie).\n\nWhile many of us gather around the table in our homes, one of the other traditions of the holiday has been to gather around a table in a restaurant and allow the ambiance of the eatery to envelop the family and friends in celebration. The menu from the Hotel Bennett in 1921 shows the wide variety of holiday fare, all of it for only $1.50! Similar menus could be found in other restaurants and hotels for the day.\n\nToday, we enjoy the meal and then loosen our belts and sit down to enjoy a football game on television. While the advent of television brought the sport closer to home, the enjoyment of the game dates back more than a century. Newspaper articles show that football has been a part of our community for generations. Of course, those were football games played by local high schools and enjoyed in person and via radio broadcast.\n\nWhile the holiday might be a time of giving thanks, it is also traditionally a time for charity. Accounts from more than a century discuss a gathering of people to serve a holiday meal to those less fortunate, or those who cannot celebrate with family.\n\nIn the early 1900s, meals were prepared for children at St. Mary’s Orphanage and the Susquehanna Valley Children’s Home. Meals were brought to the prisoners in the jail. The Salvation Army laid out a sumptuous feast for many of the homeless in the community. This tradition was continued by the Volunteers for America, and continues today at places like Binghamton High School.\n\nPerhaps that is the greatest tradition of the holiday: the spirit of helping others, of giving of one’s time and effort to help your fellow resident without any expectation of having to get something back. Watching everyone, no matter what position in society or economic status, sitting down with each other and enjoying a good meal.\n\nIt makes the day truly one of giving thanks for all that we have.

He is helping to chair the march and the rally at this year's National Day of Mourning gathering in Plymouth.\n\nThe \"Suppressed Speech\" by James describes how different it is to look back on what happened to his people since the arrival of the Mayflower compared to the shorter history of the white man in America.\n\nWhile many of us gather to celebrate Thanksgiving Thursday, the story that many of us are taught about the origins of the holiday leaves out large swaths of Native American history and perspectives today.\n\n\"Coming together as a community for a feast and to express gratitude - that's not something that was imported to this continent because of colonization.\" Pierite said. \"Indigenous peoples have had these practices going back beyond, beyond colonial contact.\"\n\n\"While we are mourning some tragic history but also contemporary issues, we are also expressing gratitude for each outer and building this community space,\" Pierite said.\n\nWhat is Indigenous Peoples' Day?What to know about push to eliminate Columbus Day\n\nWhat the Thanksgiving myth leaves out\n\nThe Plymouth colonists and the Native American Wampanoag people \"shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the colonies\" in 1621, according to the History Channel. The Wampanoag have inhabited present-day Massachusetts and eastern Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years, according to the tribe.\n\nPaula Peters, a citizen of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and independent scholar of the history of the Wampanoag, said the notion that it was just a harmonious celebration is partly a myth.\n\n\"There wasn't an invitation extended to invite the Wampanoag to come and feast with them,\" Peters previously told USA TODAY. \"It was really quite by accident, that there were any shared festivities at all.\"\n\nThe pilgrims were celebrating their first harvest when they fired off muskets repeatedly, a form of entertainment for the settlers.\n\nHearing the blasts, the Wampanoag thought it was a threat. The supreme leader Massasoit Ousamequin assembled a small army of approximately 90 warriors and approached the settlement, much to the surprise of the pilgrims.\n\nAfter de-escalating the situation, the pilgrims and the Wampanoag feasted together, though historical texts don't indicate what they might have eaten besides deer hunted by the Wampanoag, as Peters writes in an introduction to \"Of Plimoth Plantation.\"\n\n\"The contemporary holiday perpetuates the myths of the Wampanoag and Pilgrim relations,\" Peters writes in the book. \"It conjures up Hallmark images of happy Natives and Pilgrims feasting on a cornucopia of corn, pies, and meats, including a fully dressed roast turkey.\"\n\nHow the Thanksgiving myth took hold\n\nThe Thanksgiving story became part of a national nostalgia that stoked \"Manifest Destiny\" support, according to the National Museum of the American Indian's Native Knowledge 360° resources.\n\nIn 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in an attempt to foster unity in the country, according to KN360°.\n\nBut the idyllic story they were touting erased the history of the first contact tribunes before the settlers arrived, their role in helping pilgrims, and the suffering they faced after the fact.\n\nFor example, some pilgrims were aided by Indigenous men who knew English after being forced into slavery in Spain, Peteres said. Among them was Squanto, who found his way back to his home village of Patuxet, but it had been ravaged by a great plague and decaying bodies had to be moved for settlers to make the village that would one day become Plymouth.\n\n2024 National Day of Mourning rally to focus on Palestine and environmental issues\n\nAt the National Day of Mourning, Indigenous peoples from around the world come to speak and talk about the fights they're facing in their homes, Pierite said. They pray, they march and they rally. (People can also tune in to watch the livestream.)\n\n\"There's absolutely...many different emotions,\" he said. \"It is a heavy time, but the thing of it is, is that we keep...the energy, we open in prayer, we close in prayer and we continue to lift each other up.\"\n\nThis year's event will include a Palestinian speaker, Pierite said, and organizers encourage donations to groups that support Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Pierite said some folks impacted by pipelines and other energy extraction projects are expected to speak as well.\n\n\"The message from Indigenous peoples internationally has been consistent: that we need to center the development of traditional ecological knowledge, Indigenous knowledge, and move away from fossil fuel extractive economies,\" Pierite said. \"At this time the world needs Indigenous peoples.\"\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

But according to Rayna Green, a curator at the National Museum of American History, Thanksgiving started out as an impromptu gathering of pilgrims and natives, to eat and hang out. All cultures understood what a good thing feasting was, so the First Thanksgiving participants brought what they had — game, fish, squash, cranberries — and gorged in peace. The pilgrims could officially give thanks to God too, for not starving to death in the New World that year, thanks to the guidance of the American Indians who taught them to farm indigenous crops.\n\nWhile thanksgivings were celebrated after that, Thanksgiving wasn’t declared a national holiday until President Lincoln made it so in 1863. According to Green, the pilgrims' first Thanksgiving became part of American mythology in the decades that followed, taught in schools as a matter of history — part of our national identity and being. In the fullness of time, Thanksgiving shed its religious aspects and became an established secular celebration of gratitude with family and friends. Venison and fish gave way to turkey, traditions came and went, and Thanksgiving has been morphing ever since.\n\nVictory for Frankenfish and for Mother Earth: Column\n\nAnd it should. Even today, we should reassess the where, what and how of Thanksgiving, individually and nationally. While the mythology has made Thanksgiving a steadfast national holiday, we need to ask ourselves: Is it time for a change in our celebrations and traditions, even for the holiday that seems cast in historical granite?\n\nTwo years ago, there was a big change for our family — a generational one. It was not a reassessment of the worthiness or grateful spirit of the holiday, but a change of venue and some traditions. I had staged Thanksgiving for upward of 40 years. Everyone flew or drove to our house, and I set the beautiful table with my best china, recreated the time-honored recipes for pie and stuffing and found just the right turkey.\n\nBut during those 40 years, I got old, and so did Thanksgiving. The pies were the first to go. I easily gave up the time-consuming mess of rolling out my mother’s impossible dough and composing her elaborate pie fillings. The perfect table setting was next. It gave way to the more informal buffet, first with china, then with decorative plastic plates. After a bad back injury, guests brought some of the food. Thanksgiving had become a potluck buffet supper. But Thanksgiving still started with a prayer, and it still was about gratitude for everything we have.\n\nI was officially “retired” from Thanksgiving hostess two years ago when one daughter-in-law called me apologetically and suggested she stage the whole holiday at her house that year. She and my son were newlyweds, proud to have a home and a feast to invite their families to. Their time had come; mine was over.\n\nAmerica must welcome those seeking freedom: Ant�nio Guterres\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nI accepted my fate with some pensive resignation. Thanksgiving had always been my proud holiday. But I had begun to ask myself: Could I still do it anymore? I recalled how my mother and grandmother moved around so painfully during their last holidays too. I wondered how they felt when the end of Thanksgiving came for them: Did they have a sense of relief or of remorse, as they were forced to acknowledge the relentless passage of time?\n\nPerhaps they smiled, as I did. There it was again, the beautiful table and the great feast along with a busy hostess and helpers, energetically intent on getting everything just right. Some new relatives, babies and friends were added to that family circle. There were even some new holiday specialties added to the feast, reflecting the diversity of cuisine and people that had come to our table, as it had to the great American culture around us.\n\nThanksgiving has become a forever holiday in America, even if it didn’t start that way. It endures wherever we are, whatever stage of life we’re in. Once a year, no matter what, we stop and give thanks for what we have, what we are. It is a national holiday of gratitude — not for the crop that was just brought in, but for the good things we enjoy now, crops or not.\n\nImagine that: a holiday devoted to stopping and thinking about how lucky we are, wherever we are in our national history, during wars, recessions and tumultuous times along with those prosperous years of nice houses and growing bank accounts. At least once a year, Americans can stop in their tracks, embrace their families and think: This is good, and we are very lucky compared with the rest of the world.\n\nVery lucky.\n\nAlcestis \"Cooky\" Oberg, a freelance writer living in Houston, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

It's also a sad day reflecting on the atrocities that happen to Native people.\n\nBrandy Unruh, 43, Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Cree: I have mixed feelings on Thanksgiving. I have two sides because my dad's family came through Ellis Island, and my mom's family was Bitterroot Salish and Cree. Without them, I wouldn't be here, so I focus on the positive. I love the holidays because we get a break from work and school to spend time with our families.\n\nLeslie Stump-Meyers, 35, Chippewa Cree: Celebrating the colonization of Indigenous people is sad. Instead, we celebrate by remembering what our ancestors went through and how they persevered.\n\nKirby Drake, 36, Crow: It's somber, but I like the food.

The young birds, Liberty and Bell, allegedly hail from Minnesota, though I was unable to independently confirm their place of origin.\n\nIs “Minnesota” some kind of code word used by members of the Biden Crime Family? Are we to believe the president issued these pardons without expecting something in return?\n\nSomething about Joe Biden's turkey pardons seems very suspicious\n\nAdding to my suspicions, I could hear the turkeys speaking a language that definitely wasn’t English.

Is that why Biden pardoned them?\n\nI’m just asking questions here, folks.\n\nPresumably Hunter Biden is a part of this turkey-pardoning conspiracy\n\nAs if this so-called decadeslong White House tradition didn’t already seem dodgy, I read on the internet Tuesday that the “two turkeys President Joe Biden pardoned Monday have been spotted at Hunter Biden's home.”\n\nDid they ride over there in the president's Corvette, the one where he stores all his classified documents? I don’t know. Am I the one who posted the information about the turkeys being at Hunter Biden’s house on the internet? We’ll never know for certain.\n\nBut what’s abundantly clear is these now-pardoned turkeys were very likely board members of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, the very same company that once had Hunter Biden on its board.\n\nPolitics and Thanksgiving:How to avoid talking politics at Thanksgiving? Consider a 'NO MAGA ALLOWED' sign.\n\nEveryone who understands that facts are a form of government control knows this: Joe Biden did something nefarious involving Burisma at some point in order to protect his son from something that was certainly explosively corrupt. I’d explain the details and the evidence that back these claims up, but I don’t feel you can be trusted with that information.\n\nI also don’t have that information because it doesn’t exist, but I believe in it strongly enough to manifest my own reality.

(Families are notoriously afraid of TRUTH SEEKERS.)\n\nUnfortunately, to get to the heart of this bird conspiracy – which I’m quite sure also involves China, Hillary Clinton and at least one of Obama’s secret madrasas – we’re going to need congressional subpoenas.\n\nSo I’m calling on some of our most intelligent and sensible lawmakers – like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar and George Santos – to launch an immediate investigation into Liberty and Bell, the so-called farm in Minnesota where they allegedly were raised and the Biden administration’s obvious scheme to solicit foreign money in exchange for Thanksgiving pardons.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.I regret to inform you that you're doing it wrong.\n\nWe the people deserve the truth about Biden's sinister Thanksgiving ploy\n\nWe deserve to know what really happened, and whether the turkeys were, at any point, in possession of Hunter Biden’s other laptop.

A look back.", "text": "Every year, the president \"pardons\" one or two turkeys before the Thanksgiving holiday. This may be one of the more eccentric jobs the president takes on during their tenure, but the yearly \"pardoning\" has become a tradition of its own.\n\nBut how did the tradition start and who was the first president to pardon a turkey?\n\nThe national Thanksgiving turkey presentation has been observed since 1947, according to the National Turkey Federation. So, before you dig into your bird this holiday season, here's a primer on its annual pardoning.\n\nWhat is the turkey pardoning?\n\nIt is believed Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey in 1863. Lincoln's son Tad allegedly became attached to the turkey that was fated to be served at the family's Christmas meal, according to the History Channel. Lincoln was said to have spared the bird from becoming dinner, based on an 1865 dispatch by White House reporter Noah Brooks. This account, however, may be overstated, the White House Historical Association reports.\n\nStarting in 1947, the National Turkey Federation began giving the president a turkey ahead of Thanksgiving. \"The White House Presentation signals the beginning of the holiday season of national thanks, historically representing agriculture’s bountiful harvest,\" the federation's website states. Each year, the president receives the National Thanksgiving Turkey and an alternate.\n\nThe first president to receive a live turkey was Harry S. Truman from the National Turkey Federation. As a result, he is often credited as the first to pardon a turkey. But the 33rd president does not hold that title. Many confuse this Truman's presidency did mark the start of the official turkey presentation.\n\nThe turkeys Truman received actually met the fate of becoming a holiday feast. In 1948, Truman said to reporters that the birds would \"come in handy\" for Christmas dinner, according to the History Channel.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving?What date it is - and why it's always on a Thursday.\n\nWho was the first president to pardon a turkey?\n\nThe first president to pardon a turkey was John F. Kennedy, the White House Historical Association reports. The words \"pardon\" and \"reprieve\" were used by the Washington Post in a 1963 article, while Kennedy said of the turkey, \"Let's keep him going.\"\n\nRonald Reagan was the first to formally use the term \"pardon\" in regard to a turkey, the History Channel reports. In 1987, Reagan was asked by reporters if he'd pardon his aides who had been accused in the Iran-Contra scandal. He ignored those questions, but joked, \"I'll pardon him,\" of the 55-pound Thanksgiving bird.\n\nIt wasn't until the George H.W. Bushpresidency that pardoning turkeys became commonplace for the president. According to the History Channel, on Nov. 17, 1989, Bush said of the turkey:\n\n\"Let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy. He’s granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\" - President George H.W. Bush\n\nFrom then on, two lucky birds get to live out the remainder away their days without worrying about ending up on the Thanksgiving dinner table.\n\nWhy is it called Black Friday?It wasn't always the biggest shopping holiday of the year.\n\nJust Curious for more?

Biden has acknowledged he actually is a big fan of the lunchbox classic. What the president said \"no\" to was making a pair of Indiana turkeys, affectionately named Peanut Butter and Jelly, the centerpieces of traditional holiday meals.\n\nPeanut Butter and Jelly were last year’s presidentially pardoned turkeys, the first from Indiana in about 15 years.\n\nWith their new freedom and celebrity, Peanut Butter and Jelly have been living a life of luxury at Purdue University. That’s right, they’ve been gobbling up the good life.\n\nThe two toms, or male turkeys, are enjoying their retirement at Purdue’s Animal Sciences Research and Education Center, a farm setting just about 10 miles off campus.\n\nWhile there are about 700 turkeys that are taken care of at the Center, Peanut Butter and Jelly have their own digs. You can’t miss it: It’s a small red barn with a big 3-foot insignia on the back that reads “Seal of the National Thanksgiving Turkey.”\n\nThe barn is newly-built for the duo, and has air conditioning for the summer months and heating for when the weather gets chilly.\n\nThat barn opens onto to a fenced pasture and grove of trees — all told, between the barn and grassy area, Peanut Butter and Jelly have about 2,000 square feet of space to call their own.\n\n“They don’t know how good they have it,” said Jillian Ellison, a spokeswoman with Purdue’s Agricultural Communications Office. “They’re like dogs that way.”\n\nThat’s not the only way they’re spolied: The turkeys also regularly get treats. According to Jason Fields, the poultry unit manager and Peanut Butter’s and Jelly’s main caretaker, their favorites are blueberries, grapes and grub worms.\n\nThe two turkeys, which weigh about 45 pounds each, are good friends — where one goes the other follows, Fields said. They rarely are more than a few feet apart.\n\nThey also have a special relationship with Fields, who tries to give them hugs fairly often.\n\nHe says each bird has its own personality. Jelly has a little extra skin over his eye that gives him a perpetual scowl.\n\n“That’s just the way he looks,” Fields said. “It just looks like he’s grumpy all the time.”\n\nBut the appearance is fitting. He describes Jelly as the bird with attitude. Peanut Butter, on the other hand, is a bit more friendly.\n\nIn truth, Ellison said, they both are really sweet and love to be around people. They recognize the sound of Fields’ truck tires on the gravel road, coming out to greet him each morning. Peanut Butter and Jelly also like to be outside in their pasture when workers or students are walking around the Center and barns.\n\nThey are a bit of attention hogs, or turkeys, Fields said.\n\nIt makes sense, though, they were raised to be comfortable around people.\n\nPeanut Butter and Jelly were raised by a farming family down in Jasper. They were two of about 40 in the flock of turkeys raised for possible inclusion in the annual holiday photo opportunity on the White House lawn. That group also got its own brand-new barn and the family made sure to interact with them multiple times throughout the day.\n\nAndrea Welp, the farmer, said her two young children would play music and spend time with the turkeys so they were used to loud noises and lots of movement around them.\n\nThey also hosted visitors at the farm to see the flock, including family, friends, neighbors and several field trips. That’s actually how Peanut Butter and Jelly got their names — several students who visited put those names in the suggestion box.\n\nWelp said Peanut Butter and Jelly stood out from the flock to be selected as the turkeys of honor: “They were front runners from very early on,” she said.\n\nShe worked with all the turkeys every day and even practiced looking presidential, which she described as strutting their stuff up on the table at the White House.\n\n“Peanut Butter just knew what he had to do from the beginning to make it to get his presidential pardon,” Welp said, “and Jelly wasn’t far behind.”\n\nThe royal treatment kept rolling in Washington, D.C. where the nation literally rolled out a red carpet for their arrival. Peanut Butter and Jelly also got their very own suite at the Willard InterContinental Hotel before the ceremony.\n\nConservation: In bill gutting wetland protection, lawmakers agreed to a study. It found new law harmful.\n\nWhile they may be in retirement, their celebrity status has only continued to grow. The turkeys were greeted with a welcome party at Purdue when they arrived on campus and they since have had many “appearances” around the state.\n\nTheir biggest was roughly a month spent at the Indiana State Fair over the summer. Fields and the Purdue team moved Peanut Butter’s and Jelly’s entire barn to the fairgrounds, so that they would feel at home.\n\nJust about everyone who meets the turkeys wants to take a picture with them. That includes Jerome Adams, the former U.S. Surgeon General and Health Commissioner of Indiana.\n\n“Even the actual celebrities think the turkeys are celebrities,” Fields said.\n\nAs exciting as it is to have the national pardoned turkeys hail from Indiana, they also help serve an important purpose: Education.\n\nFields said they help people get interested in farming and learn about livestock agriculture throughout the state and region in a way they might not otherwise. Indiana is the fourth-largest turkey producer in the country, no. 1 in duck production and second for number of eggs produced.\n\nThe celebrity fowl open the door for those conversations, he said.\n\nEven though they will soon be passing on their title — this year’s pardon ceremony will be Monday, with turkeys from North Carolina — Peanut Butter and Jelly will keep their enclosure and luxurious lifestyle. Fields said he hopes they won’t be the last presidentially pardoned turkeys from Indiana.\n\nEven as their reign as 2021's Presidentially Pardoned Turkeys comes to an end, Peanut Butter and Jelly will keep a few engagements throughout the year, as their health allows.\n\nBut their age is starting to show: Their beards, the black tuft of whiskers on their chest, continue to grow longer. Both turkeys are about a year and a half, and likely will live to be between four to five years old.\n\nDespite their regal stature, they really are quite clumsy — in an endearing way, Ellison said — with large feet that resemble what a dinosaur’s feet might look like. They don’t move anywhere fast — but why would they want to, Fields added, they’ve got all they could want right here.\n\n\"It's their own little sanctuary,\" he said.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com.

The only red wave this season is going to be if German Shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce,” Biden told an audience on the White House South Lawn.\n\nJustice, and perhaps a side of cranberry sauce, was served as Biden roasted the 2022 National Thanksgiving Turkey and an alternate, Chocolate and Chip. The president quipped that the two birds were part of “another flock hoping to come to Washington in 2024.”\n\nBaste on tradition, Biden designated Chocolate as the official National Thanksgiving Turkey, but both Chocolate and Chip were pardoned. The birds weigh in at 46 and 47 pounds, respectively, and were raised by National Turkey Federation (NTF) chairman Ronnie Parker near Monroe, North Carolina.\n\nAs he began his remarks on the crisp November morning, Biden joked he would keep it short because “nobody likes it when the turkey gets cold.”\n\nThe poultry of honor arrived in Washington, DC, over the weekend, where they gobbled up an opportunity to stay at the nearby Willard Hotel and ruffled some feathers as they trotted around a Sunday press conference.\n\nBiden made much ado about stuffing before heading to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina, for a Friendsgiving dinner with service members and military families, part of first lady Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative. The Biden family will spend the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, where family discussions about the president’s political future and a 2024 run will begin in earnest.\n\nDespite the cornucopia of jokes cracked Monday, the turkey pardon comes as Americans are facing rising costs at their Thanksgiving tables. The American Farm Bureau’s annual survey found that the average price of Thanksgiving dinner is up 20% since last year due to high inflation, as well as supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine.\n\nThere was also the added challenge this year, the Department of Agriculture said in a memo, of a “highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which resulted in the loss of over 50 million birds, including over 8 million turkeys.” The USDA, the memo said, worked with states and producers “to implement a comprehensive, collaborative, and all-hands-on-deck response to this outbreak and ensure there is an adequate supply of turkeys for the holiday season, successfully ensuring that everyone who wants a bird will be able to get one.”\n\nRumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as the Lincoln administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln’s young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe NTF became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947 and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since President Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from them – however, he did not spare the bird.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 21: U.S. President Joe Biden pardons Chocolate, the National Thanksgiving Turkey, as he is joined by the 2022 National Turkey Federation Chairman Ronnie Parker on the South Lawn of the White House November 21, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren’t chicken.”\n\n“Yes, we cran,” Obama added.\n\nChocolate and Chip will retire to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, following their trip to the nation’s capital.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/24/bidens-cabinet-election-certifications-5-things-know-tuesday/6391441002/", "title": "Biden's cabinet, election certifications, Trump's turkey pardon: 5 ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBiden to introduce new hires in Delaware\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden was scheduled to introduce some of his personnel picks Tuesday at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.

Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign over the board’s actions, leaving the future of the AI company on shaky ground. More than 500 of OpenAI's 700-plus employees have signed a letter urging the company’s board to resign and some have threatened to join the newly-announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Altman and Greg Brockman, another OpenAI co-founder and former president who quit in solidarity.

Food bank leaders from all corners of the country tell USA TODAY their neighborhood pantries are serving more people while using less resources, as economic pressures continue to ravage the budgets of low-income Americans and service providers alike. And after pandemic-era boosts to government food aid ended earlier this year in many states, families are turning to food banks to close a gap.

It's very unusual.\"\n\nFollowing the tradition of earlier presidents, Trump spared the lives of both of the turkeys presented to him, but he announced an official presidential pardon only for Butter, who was officially designated this year's National Thanksgiving Turkey.\n\nThe guests at the ceremony included two House Republicans who are among Trump's most ardent defenders, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. \"They have all been great warriors,\" Trump said of his congressional guests.\n\nTrump also extolled his presidency during the ceremony, praising the stock market and the military, and telling the crowd that \"our country is doing very well\"\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has used the traditional turkey pardoning to make jokes about his political opponents.\n\nAt last year's event, held less than a month after Democrats won control of the U.S. House in the congressional elections, Trump wisecracked about the opposition's desire to investigate him.\n\n“Even though Peas and Carrots have received a presidential pardon, I have warned them that House Democrats are likely to issue them both subpoenas,” he said.\n\nBread and Butter:Trump to pick between Bread and Butter at annual turkey pardoning ceremony\n\nTrump also joked about his defeats in lawsuits, telling last year's turkeys: \"Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee that your pardons won’t be enjoined by the Ninth Circuit ... Always happens.\"\n\nIn 2017, his first turkey pardoning as president, Trump joked that, while seeking to reverse many of the actions taken by predecessor Barack Obama, \"I have been informed by the White House Counsel’s Office that Tater and Tot’s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked ... So, Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a task force on missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n\n“That’s something that should have been done a long time ago,” Trump said at an Oval Office signing ceremony.\n\nAfter the turkey pardoning, Trump is scheduled to leave the White House for a Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida – his first holiday since he switched his residency from New York City to Florida.\n\nThe president kicks off the weekend with a campaign rally Tuesday night in Sunrise which is about 50 miles southwest of Palm Beach.\n\nTrump also warmed up for his turkey pardoning by tweeting.\n\nIn a series of posts, Trump criticized a judge's decision that White House Counsel Donald McGahn must testify to Congress about claims the president tried to short-circuit the Russia investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The administration is appealing the ruling.\n\n'The ultimate fighter':Conan, the military dog wounded in Islamic State raid, gets hero's welcome at White House\n\nHouse Democrats are also seeking testimony from Trump aides in the impeachment investigation involving Ukraine. Trump is accused of using foreign aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating U.S. Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump said he is \"fighting for future Presidents\" in appealing the ruling that the White House lawyer must testify.\n\nDenouncing the \"D.C. Wolves and Fake News Media\" over the impeachment saga, Trump said he would not mind testimony from McGahn, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, retiring Energy Secretary Rick Perry, or Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney because, he said, he has done nothing wrong.\n\n\"It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but, future Presidents should in no way be compromised,\" he said. \"What has happened to me should never happen to another President!\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/06/rocky-mountain-dry-ashes-american-flags-tom-petty-degree-news-around-states/49487927/", "title": "Rocky Mountain dry, ashes of American flags: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDelta: The highest point in the state, Cheaha Mountain, will soon become a repository for the ashes of retired American flags. A vault called “Old Glory Lookout” has been added to Cheaha State Park in Delta and will be dedicated Tuesday, on the 80th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The vault will hold the remains of old U.S. flags, which are supposed to be destroyed by fire. A statement from Alabama’s state park system said the container consists of a steel vault encased in quartzite that was cut by members of the Civil Conservation Corps, a New Deal program formed in the 1930s under then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The vault is on the eastern slope of a ridge near a public boardwalk. The project is a joint effort between an American Legion post in Atmore and the park, located about 80 miles east of Birmingham. Paul Chason, adjutant for the American Legion post, said military, veteran and civic organizations will be able to inter flag ashes at the site. “We believe it is the first of its kind in America,” he said. Flags that were retired and burned during a ceremony on the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, will be placed in the vault during the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough is suing the Alaska Redistricting Board over recently drawn legislative boundaries that it says dilutes the votes of its residents. The lawsuit – brought on behalf of the borough and Michael Brown, the borough manager – was filed Thursday, their attorney Stacey Stone said. The board finalized its maps Nov. 10, triggering a 30-day period in which challenges could be filed. The board was charged with rewriting Alaska’s political boundaries following the 2020 census. The lawsuit cites concerns with the degree to which the target population for House districts was exceeded in the region and says two shared districts, with Valdez and parts of the Denali Borough, ignore “logical, municipal, and natural boundaries.” Peter Torkelson, the board’s executive director, said the board “will review any legal challenges with our counsel and then respond through the court system as contemplated by the Alaska Constitution.” A plan proposed by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough included four full House and two shared House districts. It did not seek to be paired with Valdez in one of the shared districts. Officials with the borough and Valdez argued against such a pairing.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A high school principal will not be back next year after a firestorm over a summer book assignment. The Paradise Valley Unified School District governing board voted Thursday not to renew the contract of Linda Ihnat, principal at Horizon High School. Ihnat failed to follow procedure when it came to informing parents about sensitive content in a book, according to board members. The book, “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed” by Jon Ronson, was an option on an Advanced Placement English reading list last summer. The book examines victims of social media mobs and so-called cancel culture. Controversy erupted last month after some parents became aware of sexual content in the book, including references to orgies and bestiality. Ihnat was put on leave. Superintendent Troy Bales issued an apology letter to parents Nov. 16. He wrote that the book was not on a district approved literature list, nor was it age-appropriate. He also promised better reinforcement of procedures when it comes to relaying assigned books to parents. Several parents and students – some with signs – showed up to Thursday’s meeting to give public comment. Some protested and called for the teacher to be fired. But others argued that the sexual content was only a small portion of the book and that teachers should be given more discretion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A computer used by Josh Duggar at work contained child pornography behind a partition that allowed the user to circumvent an application that monitors internet use, and metadata indicates the images were downloaded when the former reality TV star was working, computer forensics experts testified. Duggar, 33, is charged with receiving and possessing child pornography and faces up to 20 years in prison on each count if convicted. His federal trial began last week in northwest Arkansas. Defense attorneys for Duggar have argued that someone else downloaded or placed the child pornography onto the work computer, noting that no child pornography was found on Duggar’s phone or laptop. But federal prosecutors have detailed logs showing, minute by minute, the activity on Duggar’s computer that alternated between him sending personal messages, downloading child porn and saving pictures of notes. On Thursday, Justice Department computer expert James Fottrell testified that a Linux open-source operating system and a browser capable of encryption were installed behind a partition on the used-car dealership’s desktop computer. That essentially split the hard drive into a public-facing side that was business-related and included the tracking program and a secret second side using Linux and the browser, experts said. This allowed anyone using the computer to evade an accountability program installed to report to Duggar’s wife about inappropriate internet activity, such as searching for pornography.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A stench that emanated from a flood-control channel in a Los Angeles suburb and triggered thousands of complaints resulted from chemicals that flowed from a storage yard during a fire and caused vegetation to decay, air regulators said Friday. The South Coast Air Quality Management District said in a statement that it issued notices of violation to four companies and Los Angeles County, which is responsible for maintaining Dominguez Channel. The notices allege the emissions of hydrogen sulfide caused a public nuisance. The fire began Sept. 30 at a warehouse property in Carson where two companies stored large amounts of wellness and beauty products, and chemicals including ethanol subsequently flowed into the channel, the district said. Complaints of a rotten-egg stench began Oct. 3 and eventually came from thousands of people in at least a half-dozen communities in the area. The air district sent violation notices to two companies’ whose products were involved, the company that owns the property and its parent company, and LA County. Prologis Inc., the parent of the company that owns the property, said in a statement that it was working with the Los Angeles County Fire Department to safeguard the property from stormwater runoff and to clean up the fire debris.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Mile High City’s winter has started with a whimper, and the parched mountains to the west aren’t faring much better. Denver has already shattered its 87-year-old record for the latest measurable snowfall, set on Nov. 21, 1934, and it’s days away from breaking an 1887 record of 235 consecutive days without snow. The scenario is playing out across much of the Rocky Mountains, as the West at large is experiencing a megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. The warm, dry weather has drawn crowds to restaurant and bar patios in Denver, and the city’s parks and trails have been bustling with people basking in the sunshine in shorts, short sleeves and occasionally flip flops. As enjoyable as the weather is, climate scientists and meteorologists are warning that prolonged drought could threaten the region’s water supply and agriculture industry. It also could hurt tourism, which relies heavily on skiers, snowboarders, rafters and anglers. “Every day that goes by that we don’t see precipitation show up, and we see this year-to-year persistence of drought conditions, it just adds to a deficit. And we continue to add to this deficit year after year, particularly in the Colorado River Basin,” said Keith Musselman, a hydrologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwalk: Multiple students at a southwestern Connecticut high school were hospitalized after using a vaping product at school. WABC-TV reports police responded to the school Friday afternoon after receiving a report of a student needing medical attention. Officers found several students had used a vaping product that appeared to have been tainted somehow and made the students very ill. The Brien McMahon High School students were taken to Norwalk Hospital for treatment. The Norwalk Public Schools district did not immediately respond to a message Saturday seeking an update on the students and more information about the incident. Police warned parents to discuss the dangers of vaping products with their children and said they can be tainted with dangerous or deadly chemicals.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the University of Delaware to allow the state Supreme Court to weigh in on a lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions imposed by school officials last year. The judge ruled in August that current and former students could pursue claims that the university breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring. The plaintiffs are seeking partial refunds of their spring 2020 tuition and fees. Judge Stephanos Bibas said in his August ruling that the students had plausibly alleged the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” he wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Following that ruling, the university sought to petition the Delaware Supreme Court for a determination on whether state law permits an implied contract to be formed between a university and a student where an express written contract exists. The university also wanted the court to determine whether any implied terms sought by a student are limited to those involving “good faith and fair dealing.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Holiday decorations unveiled last week for Joe and Jill Biden’s first White House Christmas honor front-line workers who persevered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses, doctors, teachers, grocery store workers and others are recognized in this year’s gigantic Gingerbread White House, which was made into a 350-pound gingerbread village with the addition of a school and police, fire and gas stations, as well as a hospital, a post office, a grocery store and a warehouse to honor workers who stayed on the job. Fewer people are likely to see the decked-out mansion in person this year, with public tours still suspended because of the continuing threat from COVID-19. But videos, photos and other details are available at WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays. “Gifts from the Heart” is the theme. In remarks thanking volunteers for decorating, the first lady explained the vision behind her theme, speaking of unity and her view that everyone comes together around faith, family and friendship, gratitude and service, and love for one’s community. Front-line workers are also represented in the iridescent doves and shooting stars that illuminate the East Colonnade hallway, “representing the peace and light brought to us by all the front-line workers and first responders during the pandemic,” the guidebook says.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: Nearly two decades after earning a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and more than four years after his death, rock icon Tom Petty has been awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Florida. The school’s board of trustees unanimously voted to award Thomas Earl Petty a posthumous doctoral degree in music during a Friday meeting. Born and raised in Gainesville, Petty once worked as a groundskeeper at UF as he tried to make it in the music industry, but he was never enrolled. Petty passed away from an accidental drug overdose in October 2017. Days later during a UF home football game, the song “I Won’t Back Down” was played at the stadium as a memorial to Petty. The song has since become a regular feature at Gators games. Usually backed by the Heartbreakers, Petty broke through in the 1970s and went on to sell more than 80 million records, featuring hits like “Free Fallin,’ ” “Refugee” and “American Girl.” Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The University of Georgia is asking regents to name two buildings for some of the university’s earliest Black graduates. Last week’s proposal followed a decision by the University System of Georgia regents not to remove names of any people associated with slavery, segregation or the mistreatment of Native Americans from 75 buildings statewide. University President Jere Morehead said UGA would seek to name its existing science library for Shirley Mathis McBay, the first African American to earn a doctorate from the university. UGA also is asking regents to name a dormitory under construction for Harold A. Black, Mary Blackwell Diallo and Kerry Rushin Miller. They were the first three African American students to enroll at UGA as freshmen and graduate. Regents decide the names of buildings and facilities at all of Georgia’s 26 public universities and colleges. Their next scheduled meeting is in January. “Through these namings, we acknowledge the importance of these pioneers in the history of our institution,” Morehead said in a statement. “We celebrate their remarkable achievements and recognize the profoundly positive, lasting impact they have made on the University of Georgia.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Amid a continuing crisis over fuel contaminating the Navy’s tap water at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu’s water utility said Friday that it shut off one of its wells so it doesn’t taint its own supply with petroleum from an underground aquifer it shares with the military. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply said it acted shortly after the Navy on Thursday disclosed that a water sample from one of its wells had shown the presence of petroleum. The well is near a giant World War II-era underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years. The tap water problems have afflicted one of the military’s most important bases, home to submarines, ships and the commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region. They also threaten to jeopardize one of Honolulu’s most important aquifers and water sources. Nearly 1,000 military households have complained about their tap water smelling like fuel or of physical ailments like stomach cramps and vomiting. The Navy water system serves 93,000 people. The Navy said Thursday that it would flush clean water through its distribution system to clear residual petroleum products from the water, followed by testing to make sure the water meets Environmental Protection Agency drinking standards. The Navy said it will investigate how contaminants got into the well and fix it.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Far-right activist Ammon Bundy says hours he spent campaigning to be the next governor should count toward his community service requirement after he was convicted of obstructing police during his arrest for trespassing at the state Capitol. Aaron Welling, Bundy’s campaign treasurer, wrote to Ada County’s 4th District Court that Bundy has “completed 1,621 hours of public service,” doing what appears to be campaign activities. In the letter submitted late last month on campaign letterhead, Welling said that Bundy has traveled the state while encouraging people to “become more active in holding public officials accountable” and that he encouraged people to register to vote. When asked by phone whether the letter described community service or campaign activities, Welling told the Idaho Press newspaper: “It is what it is. If the courts don’t like it, the courts don’t like it.” Bundy was convicted of misdemeanor trespassing and resisting or obstructing officers during a jury trial earlier this summer. He was ordered to pay more than $1000 in fines and sentenced to a few days in jail, but the sentence was commuted to 40 hours of public service to be completed within 6 months. The conviction stemmed from Bundy’s Aug. 25, 2020, arrest after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse that officials ordered cleared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A civil rights attorney joined Jelani Day’s mother Friday to demand the FBI take charge of an investigation into why the Illinois State University graduate student disappeared in August and was later found dead in a river. Ben Crump told a news conference at Rainbow PUSH headquarters in Chicago that the Justice Department must step in and investigate Day’s death as urgently as it has probed cases of suspected foul play involving white victims, such as Gabby Petito. Crump, who is Black, gained prominence by representing the families of victims of police brutality and vigilante violence. “We will make him a priority,” Crump said Friday of Day. “There is a killer out there on the loose of this young Black man, and we need to find him.” A coroner determined in October that Day died from drowning but said it was unclear how the 25-year-old had gone into the Illinois River, 60 miles north of Bloomington, where he was last seen. LaSalle County’s coroner said an autopsy on Day found no evidence of “manual strangulation, an assault or altercation, sharp, blunt or gunshot injury.” Authorities have said his death remains under investigation. But Day’s mother, Carmen Bolden Day, said law enforcement officials have all but told her they believe her son died by suicide, which she dismissed out of hand.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The two Indiana-raised turkeys given Thanksgiving pardons by President Joe Biden are now at their new Purdue University home. The turkeys arrived last week and were welcomed by visitors on the West Lafayette campus’ Memorial Mall. The turkeys named Peanut Butter and Jelly will live at Purdue’s Animal Sciences Research and Education Center, where the school says they’ll spend their days in an enclosed setting with access to a shaded grassy area. Animal sciences professor Marisa Erasmus told WLFI-TV that having the turkeys on campus will provide a chance to explain more about the birds. Indiana ranks fourth in the country in turkey production, according to Purdue. The two turkeys were raised by Jasper, Indiana-based Farbest Farms, which says it oversees the raising of about 15 million turkeys each year with growers in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. The birds were featured in a Nov. 19 ceremony at the White House during which Biden continued the annual tradition of sparing them from the fate met by millions of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, launched in 2015 by the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, has finally worked through the state’s evidence kit backlog, Attorney General Tom Miller announced last week. Iowa received $3 million in federal grant money to tackle its backlog, with roughly 3,800 untested evidence kits collected prior to April 2015, including some dating back to the 1990s. The initiative worked with a private lab to test 1,606 of those kits, resulting in 852 valid DNA samples and 290 matches with other DNA profiles in federal databases. Twenty-six of those belonged to people previously convicted of sex crimes. Others were referred to local prosecutors and have so far resulted in four criminal cases and two convictions. In announcing the conclusion of the project Tuesday, Miller touted not only the hard work of sorting out the backlog but also procedural changes and additional staffing that will allow the state to process sexual assault evidence faster, with more transparency to victims, and without allowing another backlog to develop despite an 87% increase in kits submitted to the state lab for testing. “We’ve gone from a backlog that was a significant problem to a system where it takes eight weeks to test – and it can be tracked during that eight weeks,” Miller said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Dr. Lee Norman, who led the state through the coronavirus pandemic until his abrupt departure last month, has said in an interview that he was “Fauci’d” out by COVID-19 politics. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly announced Nov. 19 that Norman had stepped down both as top administrator at the state Department of Health and Environment and as state health officer. He had been the health department’s top administrator since Kelly took office in January 2019. He was replaced quickly by Janet Stanek, a longtime hospital administrator from Topeka. But in an interview with Kansas News Service published Tuesday, Norman said he resigned because he was asked. He cited constant friction between the governor and the Republican-led Legislature. “The shameful treatment in the Trump administration of public health leaders, I think, set the stage for having the same thing happen at the state level,” Norman said, citing frequent criticism from the right of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert. Referring to the constant criticism, Norman said: “To be honest with you, I think I was Fauci’d.” Kelly, in announcing Norman’s departure, praised him as “the most consequential” leader in the department’s history.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: A century-old Confederate statue outside a western Kentucky courthouse has been vandalized with red paint, authorities said. The incident involving a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside the Calloway County Courthouse was reported Thursday morning, Sheriff Nicky Knight told the Murray Ledger and Times. The monument had red paint on its base as well as the statue of Lee atop it before volunteers with Sons of Confederate Veterans and other community members cleaned it, news outlets report. The statue had drawn calls for its removal last year, including a resolution from the Murray City Council asking county officials to “expeditiously remove and relocate” the monument. County officials decided to keep it, saying it was erected to honor residents who fought for the Confederacy and not, “as several have argued, for the purpose of promoting continued oppression.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nHolly Beach: Dredging has begun for a marsh creation project in southwestern Louisiana. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority said the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is expected to complete the 308 acres of marsh in January in Cameron Parish northwest of Holly Beach. “The project will restore critical habitat for fish, wildlife, and the people and communities who depend on those resources,” the authority’s executive director, Bren Haase, said Thursday. This is the second phase of a $3 million project that started by creating 2.3 miles of terraces to slow waves. The agency says those were finished in June. The area has been hit hard by subsidence, drought, surges from storms including Hurricane Rita in 2005, and saltwater retention caused by poor drainage resulting from silted-in canals. The authority said 1.9 million cubic yards of sediment will be pumped from the Gulf of Mexico to make the new marsh. “The Cameron Meadows project will fortify the natural buffer that protects southwest Louisiana from storm surge while restoring hundreds of acres of coastal marsh habitat lost due to hurricanes and other factors,” agency chairman Chip Kline said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: An abandoned Maine Central Railroad Company corridor is being converted to a new multiuse trail. The Madison Branch spans 32 miles across Kennebec and Somerset Counties and will connect with the Maine Interconnected Trail System and Maine ATV Trail System, officials said. “Snowmobiles and ATVs are as much a part of the Maine outdoor experience as hiking boots, snowshoes, and skis,” said Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. “My administration has listened to our off-road recreational vehicle riding community who wants to be able to travel long distances, legally and safely, and have a good time.” The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry completed the purchase in November from Pan Am Railways at the cost of just over $1 million.\n\nMaryland\n\nPoolesville: A home was accidentally burned to the ground by an owner trying to get rid of a snake infestation, officials said. The homeowner in Poolesville, a town about 25 miles outside Washington, D.C., was attempting to use smoke to purge the snakes from the house, according to Montgomery County Fire Department officials. In the process, the homeowner caught the house on fire, causing about $1 million in damage, The Washington Post reports. The fire broke out about 10 p.m. Nov. 23, officials said. Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the county fire department, said on Twitter that 75 firefighters were called to put out the blaze that started in the basement. Piringer said that the fire, caused by placing coals too close to combustible material, was accidental and that no people were hurt. But he said the well-being of the snakes was “undetermined.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Middle and high school students would learn about the history of genocide and human rights issues under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The bill requires middle schools and high schools in the state to include instruction on the history of genocide. The legislation comes as incidences of hate and antisemitism are on the rise across the country, with several incidents reported in Massachusetts over the past year, according to supporters of the legislation. Massachusetts has not required education on the Holocaust or other genocides as part of its classroom curriculum. Lawmakers renewed the push for mandating education about the history of genocide earlier this year after a Duxbury high school football coach was fired following reports that the team used antisemitic language, including a mention of Auschwitz, in its on-field play calling. This bill would create a Genocide Education Trust Fund to support the development of teaching materials and to provide professional development training for educators. The legislation would also require school districts to annually file a description of their lesson plan and programs to educate students about genocides with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Thursday unanimously approved $3.3 billion in water infrastructure spending to replace lead pipes and repair aging dams around the state while also sending money to a Detroit-area system that has struggled with flooding blamed on climate change. The House will next consider the massive influx of aid, likely in the new year. It includes about $2.4 billion in federal funding – $1.4 billion from the infrastructure law enacted last month and nearly $1 billion from the pandemic rescue law passed in March. Senators initially proposed $600 million to replace service lines that can leach lead into drinking water if the supply isn’t properly treated. They upped it to $1 billion following the passage of the federal infrastructure bill. Benton Harbor currently is grappling with elevated lead levels in homes. The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated Michigan has 460,000 lead pipes in the ground, the third-most in the country. State regulations, made tougher following Flint’s water crisis, generally require that every line be replaced by 2040 – which could cost $2.5 billion in today’s dollars.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The U.S. Forest Service plans to reduce the number of entry permits for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness next year, citing damage to natural resources, crowding and congestion. The Forest Service didn’t say how many permits would be eliminated, nor which entry points into the million-acre wilderness would be affected. Superior National Forest spokeswoman Joanna Gilkeson said the reduction will be spread across the entire wilderness, with a focus on more popular entry points and lakes where visitors have complained over the years about resource damage and an inability to find campsites. The number of visitors to the Boundary Waters has surged amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people look for more outdoor recreation. Nearly 166,000 people visited the BWCA in 2020, a 16% jump from the previous year and the most in at least a decade, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The number of permits issued jumped from about 25,000 to more than 30,000, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The increased popularity played a role in what Forest Service officials said was “unprecedented natural resource damage,” including cutting of trees, littering, and improper disposal of human waste. There were also reports of increased crowding and noise levels, plus disruptive, oversized groups.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has declared that a state law allowing landlords to seize tenants’ belongings during the eviction process is unconstitutional. In his Tuesday order, U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills called the Mississippi law “unpredictable and absurd” and said it goes further than eviction statutes in any other state in the U.S. Under current law, “Mississippi tenants who overstay their lease may be confronted with the loss of virtually everything they own, even cherished belongings such as family photos and diplomas which have no discernable economic value to the lessor,” Mills wrote. Mills was tasked with reviewing Mississippi’s law after Columbus resident Samantha Conner filed a lawsuit last year against an apartment rental company, the apartment’s owner and manager, and the Lowndes County constable. She was aided by a low-income housing clinic at the University of Mississippi School of Law. When she was evicted in 2019, Conner said, her landlord changed the locks on her apartment and refused to let her take any of her belongings from inside, including her computer and hard drive needed for her work as a paralegal, keepsakes from when her son was a baby, family photographs and personal records. Many of her personal items were later discarded by her landlord.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A state health department analysis shows cities that have required masks to combat the coronavirus pandemic this year saw fewer infections, but Republican Gov. Mike Parson insisted Thursday that mandates don’t work. The analysis was first reported Wednesday by The Missouri Independent and the Documenting COVID-19 project at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation following an open-records request. Parson’s office asked the health department for information on the impact of mask mandates on infections, according to emails obtained in the request. In response, the agency last month compared infection rates in urban centers, where mask mandates were in place, with rural areas between April and November. The data shows that cities with mask mandates saw fewer infections and deaths across the board. Parson on Thursday responded to the Independent’s report with a scathing 12-part Twitter thread attacking the reporter. He described the article as “purposefully misleading” and said it left out important context. “There is no definite evidence that proves mandates solely saved lives and prevented COVID-19 infections in Missouri’s biggest cities,” Parson said. He added that mask mandates “do not work and can have collateral health consequences.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Helium prospecting is picking up in north-central Montana, with Canadian companies expanding south after years of development in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Montana oil and gas records show at least two companies drilling wells in an area spanning Toole, Hill and Liberty counties. Developers say geological formations on the U.S. side of the border share similarities with areas in Canada where helium development has become part of a larger plan for long-term economic development. “It all goes back to geology,” Genga Nadaraju, Avanti Energy vice president of subsurface geology, told The Billings Gazette. “Helium is the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. It comes up from basement rock. Helium is everywhere, but in that area, there are higher concentrations of helium and the right geological conditions. We have reservoir rock, we have structure and we have a seal where you can trap it.” Drilling information at the Montana Board of Oil, Gas and Conservation shows development in potential helium sites. Permit holders have six months to show the state what they’re drilling for, but companies are disclosing Montana development to would-be investors.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: U.S. Rep. Don Bacon is among a list of Republicans being targeted by former President Donald Trump, who is calling for a “Republican patriot” to challenge the Omaha lawmaker in next year’s primary election. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated in a statement his call for Bacon and 12 other lawmakers to face primary challenges, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Trump has targeted Bacon for his vote last month in support of President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Bacon was one of 13 House Republicans who voted for the bill. Bacon’s campaign said Wednesday that Trump is “entitled to his views” but that the congressman “has a strong record of delivering results for the people of Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.” Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also issued a statement Wednesday defending Bacon, saying the congressman “has served our country honorably, he has done a good job serving the 2nd Congressional District, and has earned their trust time after time.” So far, no primary challenger has filed to run against Bacon. At least two Democrats – state Sen. Tony Vargas, of Omaha, and Omaha therapist and mental health advocate Alisha Shelton – have announced their candidacies for the seat.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In a federal effort to forcibly assimilate Native Americans into Euro-American culture, more than 20,000 students were sent to the Stewart Indian School, among more than 350 residential schools that the U.S. Interior Department plans to examine as part of the Federal Boarding School Initiative Review. On Friday, Gov. Steve Sisolak heard stories from tribal elders about the school’s history. The governor, tribal leaders, state agency heads and Interior officials discussed ways the state – which funded the school’s construction and helped gather children to send there – can contribute to the federal efforts to confront historic injustices and intergenerational trauma and honor the children who died at boarding schools. Descendants of Paiute, Washoe and Shoshone people who attended Stewart during the 90 years it was in operation told stories of bounties being offered to bring Native children to the school; of students attempting to run away due to starvation; and of extreme overcrowding in dormitories. The governor apologized on behalf of the state and promised to fully cooperate with the Interior Department and its first Native American secretary, Deb Haaland, as they review records and investigate the federal government’s past policies and oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a long-brewing mental health crisis for the state’s children, particularly those whose illness manifests as aggression, according to the latest annual report by a state watchdog agency. The 2021 report released Thursday by the Office of the Child Advocate highlights the state’s recent rollout of community-based services to prevent psychiatric hospitalizations and the long waits in emergency rooms that often precede them. But implementation was long delayed, and in the meantime, the pandemic further stressed children with “isolation, uncertainty and fear,” the report says. The effect was greatest on children with chronic developmental disabilities or those whose illness was so neglected or aggravated that they became assaultive or aggressive, according to the report. Moira O’Neill, the child advocate, said such children have been systemically excluded from acute psychiatric care at Hampstead Hospital, the private psychiatric hospital that the state is in the process of purchasing for children’s treatment. The state moved children from New Hampshire Hospital to Hampstead last year, but the contract excludes patients with “violent or aggressive behaviors resulting in criminal charges or serious bodily harm.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city will host a three-day country music concert festival next August, headlined by Luke Bryan and Morgan Wallen. The Tidalwave Music Festival will be held on the beach Aug. 12-14, 2022. An additional headliner will be announced in the coming weeks. “We knew we wanted to bring our country music festival concept to the northeast coast, but the location had to be just right,” said Brian O’Connell, president of country touring at Live Nation. “The perfect spot by the ocean in Atlantic City. We can’t wait until next summer to bring these world-class acts, alongside a tailor-made festival experience.” Also performing will be Lauren Alaina, Blanco Brown, Breland, Travis Denning, Riley Green, Lindsay Ell, Hardy, Jon Langston, Tracy Lawrence, Chase Rice, Runaway June, Elvie Shane, DeeJay Silver, Mitchell Tenpenny and Lainey Wilson. Three-day passes will go on sale beginning Dec. 13 at 10 a.m. EST at www.tidalwavefest.com.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: James Lujan has resigned as Rio Arriba County sheriff after being sentenced to prison on felony convictions of aiding a felon and intimidating a witness in 2017. Lujan submitted his resignation Thursday after being sentenced to a three-year prison term, one day after state District Court jurors convicted him following a three-day trial. A judge denied a request by Lujan’s attorney that his client remain free pending an appeal, and the 60-year-old Lujan was taken into custody by Santa Fe County sheriff’s deputies. Lujan was convicted on charges stemming from allegations he helped former Española City Councilor Philip Chacon evade police following a high-speed chase. The jury found Lujan guilty of harboring a felon for helping conceal Chacon as police were searching for him. Lujan also was found guilty of bribery of a witness for threatening one of his deputies to prevent him from revealing Chacon’s whereabouts to other officers.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new allegation of sexual harassment against Chris Cuomo emerged just days before CNN announced it was firing the anchor amid an investigation into work he did defending his brother from similar harassment allegations. Attorney Debra Katz said Sunday that her client was the victim of “serious sexual misconduct” by Cuomo and that she had contacted CNN about the woman’s allegations Wednesday. CNN suspended Cuomo last week after details emerged about how he assisted his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as the politician faced sexual harassment allegations. Katz said the accuser decided to come forward came after the New York attorney general’s office released evidence showing Chris Cuomo had taken a much more active role than previously thought in strategizing and helping to craft a response to the allegations his brother was facing. When the initial allegations surfaced against the then-governor, Chris Cuomo had told viewers he had “always cared very deeply about these issues,” Katz said. “Hearing the hypocrisy of Chris Cuomo’s on-air words and disgusted by his efforts to try to discredit these women, my client retained counsel to report his serious sexual misconduct against her to CNN,” Katz said in the statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s 2022 elections under new legislative and congressional maps can begin as scheduled this week after judges on Friday rejected demands from lawsuit filers who claim the lines have to be blocked because they so egregiously favor Republicans. The refusal of a three-judge panel to issue preliminary injunctions against the boundaries drawn and approved by GOP majorities in the General Assembly last month means candidate filings for the March 8 primary may start at noon Monday. One of the lawsuits, filed by the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, mathematicians and voters, challenges both the legislative and congressional maps. The other, filed by voters supported by a group affiliated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, focuses solely on the state’s U.S. House map. The judges said there was a reasonable doubt about whether the lines violated the state constitution. The plaintiffs in the League of Conservation Voters lawsuit filed an appeal notice with the state Court of Appeals late Friday. And Friday’s ruling doesn’t throw out the lawsuits that formed the basis for the injunction requests heard in Wake County court.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The cost of the state’s special five-day session last month is within the amount allotted, a legislative budget analyst said Thursday. Figures released to the Associated Press show costs incurred by taxpayers total just more than $301,000. About $316,000 was budgeted for the session, highlighted by redistricting legislation and the spending of nearly the entire amount of the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus aid available to the state. The Republican-led Legislature also approved policy-related measures, including bills banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the teaching of certain concepts about race and racism in public schools. Eleven of the Legislature’s 141 members had not submitted lodging and mileage expenses as of Thursday, said Allen Knudson, the lead budget analyst at the Legislative Council, the Legislature’s research arm. “We expect the final cost of the special session to be very close to the amount budgeted,” Knudson said. Most legislators make $189 daily while in session, with an extra $10 or $15 per day for certain leaders. Each day they are in a special or reconvened session costs taxpayers about $64,000, budget writers estimate. Legislators who do not live in Bismarck or Mandan are eligible for a housing and travel allowance.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge on Friday refused to dismiss the 25-count murder indictment against a doctor accused of ordering excessive painkillers for hospital patients, meaning one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional will proceed toward trial. William Husel, 46, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say he was providing comfort care for dying patients in the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System, not trying to kill them. Mount Carmel’s review concluded Husel ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years, but the fired doctor was charged only in cases involving at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. The previous prosecutor on the case, who wasn’t reelected, had said using dosages that large in nonsurgical situations – for people being taken off ventilators – pointed to an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued that during the still-secret grand jury proceedings, the prosecution must have misrepresented whether such dosages would surely be deadly, and that the resulting indictment should therefore be dismissed. They noted that prosecutors had records from a patient who was not part of the indictment who received even larger dosages and survived for days.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt denied clemency Friday for a death row inmate sentenced to die for the 1985 shooting death of a Putnam City schoolteacher. The Republican governor’s decision clears the way for Bigler Stouffer II, 79, to receive a lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. It comes despite a 3-2 recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that Stouffer’s sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. Several members of the board voiced concerns about the state’s ability to humanely execute people after John Grant convulsed on the gurney and vomited during his lethal injection in October. Stouffer has maintained his innocence in the attack on Linda Reaves and her boyfriend, Doug Ivens, that left Reaves dead and Ivens seriously wounded. Stouffer was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 after his first conviction and death sentence were overturned. He said at his parole board hearing last month that Ivens was shot as the two men fought over a gun at Ivens’ home and that Reaves was already dead when he arrived. Prosecutors said Stouffer went to the home to borrow the gun from Ivens, then fatally shot Reaves and wounded Ivens in an attempt to gain access to Ivens’ $2 million life insurance policy. At the time, Stouffer was dating Ivens’ ex-wife.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: TriMet officials say bus services will be reduced starting Jan. 9 because of an extreme shortage of bus operators. The Portland-area transit agency said TriMet would temporarily reduce service levels by 9%, meaning TriMet will shrink weekly bus service on about 20 of its 84 bus lines, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. TriMet Spokesperson Roberta Altstadt said services will be less frequent on weekdays for those lines, and most affected lines will follow Saturday schedules. Altstadt said riders should check TriMet’s online trip planner after Jan. 9. As of last week, Altstadt said the agency was short 45 operators. The agency dropped service levels by about that much in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a nearly 70% decrease in ridership. Public transit use slowly began to increase again, but TriMet has had trouble recruiting workers – a problem it hasn’t historically faced. Altstdat said TriMet has stepped up hiring efforts. Bill Bradley, an executive board member with Amalgamated Transit Union 757, representing about 2,700 TriMet workers, said the union believes the current shortage is higher, about 60 drivers. The agency saw a rise in assaults on operators around the beginning of the pandemic, which Bradley said hasn’t decreased. The stressors and dangers have taken a toll on operators, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf followed through on his veto threat Thursday, rejecting Republican-penned legislation to allow people to carry a firearm openly or concealed, without a permit, adding to his total for Pennsylvania’s chief executive with the most vetoes in more than four decades. Wolf, a Democrat, called the permitless-carry bill “dangerous.” Wolf’s veto comes amid a tide of deadly gun violence in Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, and political finger-pointing over blame. Republicans said the bill would have made people safer. Wolf has said it is a top priority to address what he says is a gun violence crisis affecting largely minority communities, but the Republican-controlled Legislature has rejected nearly all his proposals. The bill he vetoed Thursday would have removed the requirement that gun owners get a permit to carry a gun that is concealed, such as under clothing or in their vehicle’s glove box. It also would have wiped out a law, applying only to Philadelphia, that requires gun owners to get a permit to openly carry a firearm in the city. According to online state records, Wolf penned his 52nd veto with 13 months left in his second term, more than any other governor since Milton Shapp, who left office in 1979.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The largest state employees’ union in Rhode Island has approved a new four-year contract that includes $3,000 COVID-19 vaccination bonuses, officials said. Council 94 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents about 3,800 workers, overwhelmingly approved of the deal Thursday. The contract also includes 2.5% annual raises. Union and state officials said the bonus will help retain strained public workers. “Our employees continue to provide services while shouldering increased demands because of the pandemic, and it is important we recognize those efforts and make the state an employer of choice,” state Director of Administration James Thorsen said in a statement. “This was done so that we could retain your public servants,” Council 94 Vice President Lynn Loveday said. Workers can get the bonus without being vaccinated against COVID-19 if they are granted a religious or medical exemption. The program is estimated to cost $9.6 million and will be funded with federal relief dollars. Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee told WPRI-TV that the contract “was fair to the workers and fair to the taxpayers.” The bonuses drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans who said it was unfair and appeared to condemn the unvaccinated.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and his wife, Peggy, are inviting people to come to their house Monday evening to view their Christmas decorations and listen to carols. The open house at the Governor’s Mansion in downtown Columbia is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday. The Columbia Garden Club is decorating the mansion, and light refreshments will be served. Simone Bryant of Benedict College has been invited to sing Christmas carols. Admission is free, but the governor and first lady ask guests to please bring canned goods to donate to Harvest Hope Food Bank. Guided tours of the governor’s mansion are also available on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings over the next two weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Department of Health is beginning to issue medical marijuana cards, but officials say it could be months before dispensaries will have anything to sell. Municipalities across the state are also receiving applications for permits from those who want to open a dispensary. The businesses must sell marijuana that is grown in the state, and with no cultivation facilities licensed in South Dakota, the dispensaries, for now, will have nothing to sell. Importing cannabis products across state lines remains a federal offense. State health officials say they’ve received 11 cultivation applications. Commercial grow facilities are now going through the state and local application process. It could take months for them to begin selling cannabis. In the meantime, medical marijuana cardholders can grow up to three plants for personal use. Cities have taken different approaches to selling medical marijuana. Yankton will permit two medical cannabis dispensaries. “Once those two applicants get state approval, they still have to do a certificate of occupancy with the city,” said Lisa Yardley, the city’s deputy finance officer. “They still have to do a site permit. They still have to do any building permits, building inspection.” Yankton will not allow any marijuana cultivation or processing operations.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday had harsh words for state officials who continue to enforce retroactive punishments against sex offenders, some of whom committed their offenses decades before the state’s sex offender law took effect. “Tennessee officials continue to flout the Constitution’s guarantees,” U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger wrote in her ruling ordering officials to remove eight men from the sex offender registry and stop subjecting them to restrictions on where they can live and work, among other things. In April, a different federal judge, also in the Middle District of Tennessee, ordered two men be removed from the sex offender registry, finding that it was unconstitutional to subject them to sex offender laws that were written after they committed their offenses. In her Friday order, Trauger cited the April ruling and other similar recent rulings. She noted that the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 ruled against the retroactive enforcement of a Michigan sex offender law. “The federal district courts of this state have repeatedly concluded that the same analysis applies … to Tennessee’s own, very similar scheme and policies,” Trauger wrote. Despite those rulings, “Tennessee officials have continued to impose the state’s repeatedly-held-to-be-unlawful policy on other, similarly situated individuals.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: For more than seven years, no one has known what happened to $600,000 in checks and cash that were stolen from a safe at Pastor Joel Osteen’s Houston megachurch, which has one of the largest congregations in the country. Now, there’s a possible plot twist in the case: The money might never have left the church, and a plumber could have helped solve the mystery. Houston police are investigating whether cash and checks discovered by a plumber during repair work that was being done at Lakewood Church is connected to the money that was stolen in 2014. The revived investigation comes after a plumber on Thursday called “The Morning Bullpen with George, Mo & Erik on 100.3 The Bull” during a segment on the Houston radio station in which people were asked to talk about the most unusual things of value they had ever found. The plumber went on the air with his story of what he found while repairing a leaky toilet at the church about four weeks ago. “I went to go remove the toilet, and I moved some insulation away, and about 500 envelopes fell out of the wall. I was like, ‘Oh, wow.’ I got my flashlight, shined up in there,” he said in audio provided by the station. The plumber said he thought the envelopes full of money were connected to the 2014 theft and immediately told the church’s maintenance supervisor, who contacted police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park will soon require reservations to hike a famous southern Utah trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff, officials announced Friday. As of April 1, people who want to hike the narrow Angels Landing hike will need permits provided through a lottery system. The lottery will be fairer to visitors and reduce crowding on the trail, said superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh. Crowding is a major concern on the trail edged by a sheer cliff, where a small number of people typically fall and die every year, park officials have said. The number of people visiting Zion has been growing rapidly in recent years, swelling from about 2.8 million visits in 2011 to nearly 4.5 million visits in 2019. Angels Landing is one of the most sought-after destinations, and more than 300,000 people hiked it in 2019, according to park officials. There will be two lotteries, one seasonal and another for one day ahead of planned hikes. Each drawing costs $6 per person to enter, and people who win must pay a $3-per-person fee. That will cover the cost of running the lottery and rangers to check permits on the trail. The permit system will apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, often called the “chain section” because it has metal handholds driven into the rock.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The public is invited to cut down a Christmas tree from Green Mountain National Forest. A required $5 permit can be purchased online or at Green Mountain National Forest offices in Manchester and Rochester. This year, the U.S. Forest Service is providing free Christmas tree vouchers to fourth grade students in support of the Every Kid Outdoors initiative. It was created so that the country’s fourth graders and their families could discover wildlife, resources and history for free. The students must register online at everykidoutdoors.gov and present a printed voucher to redeem a Christmas tree voucher, U.S. Forest Service officials said. Trees may be harvested within designated areas of the forest and must be cut 6 inches or less from the ground, the Forest Service said. All trash and litter from the activity, including woody debris, must be removed from roads, ditches and culvert openings, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A three-judge panel overseeing a recount in a close Virginia Beach state House race upheld the Republican candidate’s victory Friday, a decision that also reaffirms the GOP’s takeover of the chamber and completes the party’s sweep of last month’s elections. Republicans also claimed the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in the Nov. 2 balloting. Those wins were a dramatic turnaround in a state where the GOP had not won a statewide race since 2009. Democrats still hold a 21-19 majority in the Senate – where elections won’t be held until 2023 – splitting control of the Legislature. The certified results from the election showed Republicans leading in 52 districts and the Democrats leading in 48. The recount in the 85th District race resulted in Democratic incumbent Alex Askew gaining 12 votes, but he still trailed Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh by 115 votes. There was one contested ballot. The panel found that the intent of the voter was unclear, so that ballot was not counted for either candidate. After Democrats requested recounts in two races with razor-thin margins, that left open the remote possibility of a 50-50 split. Though the second recount, in the 91st District, is still expected to proceed this week, Democrats no longer have a shot at undoing the GOP’s majority.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: An explosive device was tossed at the Islamic Center of Olympia – an act leaders of the facility said was an apparent act of intimidation. “It seems like it was meant to stoke fear,” Mustafa Mohamedali, social secretary for the Islamic Center of Olympia, told KING5. The Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said nobody was hurt, and there was no damage Nov. 23, but neighbors heard the blast. The explosion is the latest in a series of assaults on houses of worship in the Puget Sound region, including churches, synagogues and mosques. In October, someone set fire to the Islamic Center of Tacoma. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office didn’t respond to questions from KING5.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: John Hutchison will become the state Supreme Court’s chief justice Jan 1, the court announced Thursday. As chief justice, Hutchison will become the administrative leader of the state’s judiciary system, including circuit, family and magistrate courts. A new intermediate court system will open July 1. In 2020, Hutchison won a special election for a four-year term on the court. He was appointed in 2018 to the seat vacated by convicted former Justice Allen Loughry. The court also announced that Beth Walker will serve as chief justice in 2023. Walker also served as chief justice in 2019. The current chief justice is Evan Jenkins.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed five Republican-authored anti-abortion bills Friday. Evers, who is making his support for abortion rights a key plank of his 2022 reelection campaign, had been widely expected to veto the measures the GOP-controlled Legislature passed in October. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again today: as long as I’m governor, I will veto any legislation that turns back the clock on reproductive rights in this state – and that’s a promise,” Evers tweeted in announcing the vetoes. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override the vetoes. One bill would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the proposal is a solution in search of a problem, as doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep those babies alive. A second bill Evers vetoed would require doctors to provide the parents of fetuses and embryos that test positive for a congenital condition information about the condition. A third would prohibit abortions based on a fetus’ sex, race or national origin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The 14th annual Menorah Lighting Ceremony was held Wednesday at the state Capitol, where Rabbi Zalman Mendelsohn and Gov. Mark Gordon placed an emphasis on spreading a positive light this Hanukkah season. The event moved back indoors this year, filling a wing of the Capitol with people from around Wyoming, as well as food, music and the massive menorah that towered behind the podium. The Cheyenne Youth Symphony contributed a string ensemble to play classic Hanukkah songs prior to the event. When it was time to light the menorah, Medelsohn stepped to the podium and thanked the many people who had gathered for the event before holding a moment of remembrance for Rabbi Larry H. Moldo, who died in August 2020. To conclude the introduction, he offered a gift in the form of a metal sculpture of a menorah to Gordon, thanking him and first lady Jennie Gordon for embodying the “commonality that exists within each and every one of us.” “There’s so many different paths, so many different lifestyles and so many different political viewpoints,” Rabbi Mendelsohn said in his speech. “There’s a solid gold that brings us all together, with love, with humanity, with character and with a sense that we are all part of the same people of Wyoming.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/06"}]}

But was it really the first national Thanksgiving?\n\nHere are four things to know about Thanksgiving:\n\nWhy the Continental Congress issued the proclamation\n\nThe Continental Congress received word on Oct. 31 that British General John Burgoyne had surrendered at the Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York. Today, many historians look at that battle as a major -- or one of the turning points -- for the American side in the Revolution War, said Dan Roe, vice president of interpretation at the York County Heritage Trust.\n\nIn response to the victory, the Continental Congress formed a committee of some of the delegates, including Samuel Adams and Richard Henry Lee, to consider having a day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress issued a proclamation on Nov. 1, 1777, thanking God for the victory and encouraging colonists to observe a day of prayer and thankfulness while thinking about the cause. The day of Thanksgiving was set for Dec. 18, 1777.\n\nIt marked the first Thanksgiving for the colonies after declaring independence.\n\n\"To me, it started the tradition of sorts of what we now would consider the Thanksgiving holiday -- at least in spirit,\" Roe said.\n\n\"... I think the concept of taking an opportunity from the political standpoint, if you will, to take a day to encourage folks to have a moment of reflection and to give thanks, I think that's the continuing connection, at least for me, from the 1700s to today, even though the holiday itself may have changed slightly over the years,\" he said.\n\nLocal historian June Lloyd noted in her research that George Washington ordered his army to observe the day of Thanksgiving. The Continental Congress usually held two sessions a day -- one at 10 a.m. and one at 3 p.m. The congress only met in the afternoon on Dec. 18, 1777. Perhaps they attended a service at one of the churches in York earlier in the day, she said.\n\n\"It's another one of those things that we're proud of,\" she said.\n\nOther \"first\" Thanksgivings have been declared\n\nMost Americans think of the \"first\" Thanksgiving as the Pilgrims celebrating their harvest and first year of survival in New England in 1621. But others have given thanks over the years for their safe journey across the ocean or their arrival in America, said Nancy Egloff, a historian with the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nSome believe Thanksgiving dates back to 1513 when Juan Ponce de Leon gave thanks for his safe arrival in Florida, where he claimed the land for Spain, Egloff wrote in \"Thanksgivings in America.\"\n\nOthers point to the first Thanksgiving at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia in 1619. Captain John Woodlief was given instructions before he left England to mark the day that he and his crew landed at the plantation as a holy day of thanksgiving. It was to be observed yearly, Egloff wrote. Berkeley Plantation, which still exists today, celebrated with its Thanksgiving Festival earlier this month.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln declared it the last Thursday in November\n\nThe Thanksgiving tradition that Americans know today dates to the Victorian Era. It was in the fall of 1863, just months after the Battle of Gettysburg, when President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. Roe said maybe Lincoln was trying to bolster the spirits of the country during the Civil War. Roe added that the tradition already was out there in some form.\n\nLincoln's Thanksgiving call of 1864 gained cold reception in York, Pa.\n\nThanksgiving used to be a religious observance, now it's more secular\n\nOriginally, Thanksgiving was a religious observance, said Kevin Gutzman, professor and chair of the Department of History at Western Connecticut State University.

For the truck drivers, mail carriers, package delivery teams and others who bring things to us so that we can remain safely in our homes.

Cows loaf near their barns, deer graze on the corn kernels dropped by pickers, an occasional hawk scans the naked fields for vermin, and we can count among our blessings that we live in a place as beautiful as this.\n\nWe also can give thanks for what those fields and farms represent – the land from which we receive our food for Thanksgiving, Christmas and every other day.\n\nTurkey, chicken, beef, pork, milk, eggs, wheat for flour, fruit and vegetables produced here, combined with the food processing and packaging businesses around all of that farming, make up Ohio's largest industry.\n\nSo in this challenging year of 2021, take a moment to thank a farmer, remember the true meaning of Thanksgiving and consider a little of the history of what has become a national holiday:\n\nPresident George Washington issued a proclamation in 1789 declaring the first national day of thanksgiving, asking people for gratitude to God \"for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country\" and \"the favorable interpositions of his Providence.\"\n\nIn following years, states set their own dates for the day of thanksgiving until President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November for all to give thanks on the same day – \"reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.\"\n\nHe issued that proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863 – a year in which America was more divided than ever, one in which tens of thousands of American troops died in Civil War battles.\n\n\"In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union,\" Lincoln's proclamation said.\n\nAmid that time of unparalleled division, President Lincoln took time to remind people of the many reasons to be thankful, and he easily could have been talking about Ohio today:\n\n\"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\n\nAlan D.

Roosevelt.\n\nIt was Lincoln who issued an 1863 proclamation calling on Americans to \"set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving,\" partly to celebrate victories in the then-raging Civil War.\n\n\"He's the father of the whole idea of a nation giving thanks for its advantages and privileges of living in a democracy like this,\" said Harold Holzer, historian and chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation.\n\nDecades later, Roosevelt and Congress acted to establish Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November, in part to lengthen the Christmas shopping season.\n\nInformally, the United States government had recognized periodic days of thanksgiving from the moment of the nation's birth.\n\nIn 1777, a year after the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress declared a day of thanksgiving to celebrate a Revolutionary War victory over the British at Saratoga.\n\nThe first president, George Washington, declared a day of thanksgiving and prayer in 1789, partly to honor the new U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt took the trauma of the Civil War to make Thanksgiving a formal, annual holiday.\n\nLincoln issued his proclamation on Oct. 3, 1863, three months after Union Army victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and at a time in which ultimate triumph appeared in sight. \"There was a lot to be thankful for in the fall of 1863,\" said Allen Guelzo, the Henry R. Luce Professor of the Civil War Era at Gettysburg College.\n\nWriting that the nation's many blessings \"should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged\" by the American people, Lincoln declared: \"I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens.\"\n\n(It should be noted that while Lincoln issued this proclamation, most historians believe it was actually written by his secretary of State, William Seward.)\n\nThe proclamation served a familiar purpose for Lincoln. \"He was always looking for ways to unify the nation in a terrible time of war,\" biographer Ronald C. White Jr. said.\n\nStill, the idea of a formal Thanksgiving holiday had been gestating for a long time before Lincoln.\n\nSarah Josepha Hale, editor of the popular magazine Godey's Lady's Book, pushed the idea for years, petitioning Lincoln and his predecessors. (Thanksgiving was only one of Hale's contributions to American culture; she also wrote the poem Mary Had a Little Lamb.)\n\nAfter Lincoln, presidents issued annual Thanksgiving proclamations. In last year's proclamation, President Obama said Thanksgiving Day is \"a time to take stock of the fortune we have known and the kindnesses we have shared, grateful for the God-given bounty that enriches our lives.\"\n\nFor decades after Lincoln, Americans traditionally celebrated Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of November, even if it fell on Nov. 30 -- as happened in 1939, the end of an economically troubled decade.\n\nSome merchants worried that a late Thanksgiving would cut down on Christmas sales and asked President Roosevelt to move the holiday up by a week – which he did, creating unanticipated havoc.\n\nSome state governors objected, issuing proclamations of their own to keep Thanksgiving on Nov. 30.

With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that year's Thanksgiving to the second-to-last Thursday of November to allow for a longer Christmas shopping season. But not all states followed suit: 32 issued similar proclamations, which 16 kept Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November.\n\nBy 1941, the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution, declaring Thanksgiving Day to be the last Thursday in November each year. The Senate amended the resolution making the holiday the fourth Thursday in November, and Roosevelt signed it in December 1941.\n\nToday, Thanksgiving is recognized by the federal government to fall on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWant to save money for Thanksgiving?Here are some ideas for a cheaper holiday dinner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/10/06/texas-marks-second-year-of-indigenous-peoples-day-recognition/69541939007/", "title": "Texas marks second year of Indigenous Peoples' Day recognition", "text": "For the second year, Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day will both be celebrated in Texas on October 10.\n\nIn 2021, Gov.

California and Tennessee observe Native American Day in September, not conflicting with Columbus Day.\n\nScott Stevens, the director of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Program at Syracuse University, said Indigenous Peoples Day is about resilience of what past cultures have endured as much as it is about honoring heritage.\n\n\"It is the recognition of our survival and, in many cases, resistance and even flourishing,\" Stevens told USA TODAY. \"There still are a lot of social and economic problems that Indigenous communities experience. There's also this idea that American Indians and Native Americans, that we're all one people. But we have diversity and our cultures are vastly different. One thing we all have in common is that our ancestors suffered because of American colonialism, so it serves as an opportunity where we can turn to each other in unity.\"\n\nHow and where is Indigenous Peoples Day celebrated?\n\nWhat states and cities celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nOver a dozen states and more than 130 local governments have chosen to not celebrate Columbus Day altogether or replace it with Indigenous Peoples Day. Many states celebrate both. Eleven U.S. states celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day or a holiday of a similar name via proclamation, while 10 others treat it as an official holiday. The 10 states that observe the holiday via proclamation are Arizona, California, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd the 10 that officially celebrate it are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.\n\nSome tribal groups in Oklahoma celebrate Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day, with some groups naming the day in honor of their individual tribes.\n\nMore than 100 cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Phoenix and San Francisco.\n\nStevens said that Indigenous Peoples Day being federally recognized paves way for more allies and a space for Americans to educate themselves on a deeper level, as adults, about atrocities throughout U.S. history.\n\n\"Having a federal holiday can serve as less of a celebration but more so a recognition to past and present experiences,\" Stevens said. \"I see (Indigenous Peoples Day) as an opportunity to have more critical discussion about our American history, more than what people learn in the fourth grade about the first Thanksgiving and Pocahontas.\n\n\"Having a day recognized or having critical discussion is not anti-American. What's anti-American is self-censoring what we've been through,\" he said.\n\nWhat's open, closed on Indigenous Peoples' and Columbus Day?:What to know about mail delivery, bank hours\n\nIs it offensive to celebrate Columbus Day?\n\nLast year when Biden issued the proclamation for Indigenous Peoples Day, he also issued a proclamation of Columbus Day, established by Congress and first recognized as a national holiday in 1934 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nIn his 2021 speech, Biden praised the role of Italian Americans in U.S. society, but also referenced the violence and harm Columbus and other explorers of the age brought about on the Americas.\n\n\"We also acknowledge the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and Indigenous communities,” Biden said. “It is a measure of our greatness as a nation that we do not seek to bury these shameful episodes of our past – that we face them honestly, we bring them to the light, and we do all we can to address them.”\n\nThough some groups argue that Columbus Day, which is still a federal holiday, celebrates Italian American heritage, many say the holiday glorifies an exploration that led to the genocide of native peoples and paved the way for slavery.\n\nStevens said celebrating Columbus Day is outdated because of the cyclical and residual hurt caused from the past: \"To have had American colonialism looked at throughout history as not being a problem and celebrated as a good thing is deeply problematic to any of us who live in a (Native-American) community or reservation.\"\n\nStevens argued some Americans have a tendency to ignore that Native Americans were \"forced to be assimilated into Euro-American culture,\" and hold a misconception that Indigenous communities are only \"set in the past.\"\n\n\"We're a minority of three percent in a land that in 1491 was one hundred percent ours,\" Stevens said.\n\nAlthough Columbus is credited as the \"discoverer\" of the New World, millions of people already inhabited the Americas. Columbus made four expeditions to the Caribbean and South America over two decades, enslaving and decimating populations and opening the floodgates of European colonization.\n\nMany groups have called for the removal of monuments to Columbus.\n\n\"For over 500 years, Indigenous people have been fighting for their survival, land and rights,” Les Begay, a Diné Nation member and co-founder of the Indigenous Peoples Day Coalition of Illinois, said last October. “Each October, when Columbus is honored, it further diminishes and erases Native people, their history and their culture.\"\n\nWhen was Columbus Day established?\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus' landfall. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day a national holiday in 1934 – one of 10 official federal holidays.\n\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story published in 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/04/03/white-house-biden-easter-transgender-day-of-visibility/73181508007/", "title": "No, Biden didn't replace Easter celebration with Transgender Day of ...", "text": "[En Español: No, Biden no reemplazó la celebración de Pascua por Día de la Visibilidad Transexual]\n\nThe claim: Biden replaced Easter Sunday with Transgender Day of Visibility\n\nAn April 1 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) shows an image of President Joe Biden in front of the Easter Bunny and a Transgender Pride Flag.\n\n“Outrageous: Biden replaces Easter Sunday with 'Transgender Day of Visibility' because 'they are the image of God,'” reads the post's caption in Spanish.\n\nThe post received more than 400 likes in two days.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBiden did not replace Easter Sunday with the Transgender Day of Visibility.

The commemoration aims to recognize the contributions made by transgender people and the adversity they face.\n\nEaster, however, falls on a different date from year to year. The holiday is celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the spring equinox. This year it fell on March 31.\n\nOn March 29, Biden proclaimed March 31 as Transgender Day of Visibility. This is not the first time he has done so. On March 31, 2021, Biden issued the first-ever presidential proclamation of the day.\n\nBut Biden did not replace Easter with the commemoration as the post states. The president issued a statement about Easter on the holiday, extending \"warmest wishes\" to Christians celebrating around the world.\n\n“Easter reminds us of the power of hope and the promise of Christ’s resurrection,” the statement reads. “As we gather with loved ones, we remember Jesus’ sacrifice. We pray for one another and cherish the blessing of the dawn of new possibilities.”\n\nThe following day, he and first lady Jill Biden hosted about 40,000 people for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition since 1978.\n\nFact check: Altered image shows fabricated article about a baby taking a transgender test\n\nThe post also references Biden saying trans people being the \"image of God.\" This year, Biden did not mention the word God in his proclamation. However, he did use those words in a statement on March 31, 2023:\n\n“I want every member of the trans community to know that we see you,\" the 2023 statement said. \"You’re each made in the image of God and deserve love, dignity and respect.

The shooter is also dead, city officials said earlier this morning. Officers responded to the store less than an hour before closing around 10:12 p.m. and found the victims and evidence of a shooting, Chesapeake Police public information officer Leo Kosinski told CNN. Five patients were being treated at Sentara General Hospital in nearby Norfolk, Virginia, a spokesperson for Sentara Healthcare told CNN affiliate WTKR. An update on their conditions was not immediately available. “We’re just a couple hours past the initial incident, so everything is very fluid, very new right now,” Kosinski said earlier. A news conference is scheduled for 8 a.m. ET, the city of Chesapeake said on Twitter.\n\n2. Trump\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for the IRS to release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to a Democratic-led House committee. The high court’s move is a major loss for Trump, who has sought to shield the release of his tax returns for years and is currently under multiple investigations. Trump’s legal team has continuously sought to keep his returns secret and turned to the Supreme Court – composed of three of Trump’s nominees – after he lost at the lower court level. Separately, a New York state judge set an October 2023 trial date for the New York attorney general’s $250 million lawsuit against Trump, his eldest children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nThe Biden administration is yet again extending the pause on federal student loan payments, a benefit that began in March 2020 to help people who were struggling financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This latest extension comes as the administration’s student loan forgiveness program remains tied up in the courts. Officials had told borrowers the program, which is worth up to $20,000 in debt relief per borrower, would be implemented before loan payments were set to resume in January 2023. The pause will last until 60 days after the litigation is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023, payments will resume 60 days after that, according to the Department of Education.\n\n4. Tech layoffs\n\nComputer maker HP said Tuesday that it will lay off up to 6,000 workers over the next three years, becoming the latest tech company to significantly reduce staffing amid fears of an economic downturn. The company disclosed the job cuts in a statement accompanying its lackluster quarterly earnings report, where it also said sales dropped more than 11% compared to the same period last year. The news makes HP the latest in a growing list of once-high-flying tech companies that are now announcing major job cuts. Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon and Twitter all announced large layoffs in recent weeks.\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nThe Biden administration has launched a critical, six-week push aimed at stepping up Americans’ Covid-19 booster vaccinations heading into the holiday season. Biden’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, kicked off the campaign on Tuesday during his final White House press briefing before he retires in December. The push comes as more than 35 million Americans have already received the updated, bivalent booster shot – including more than 16 million seniors – White House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said during the briefing. But that’s a fraction of the 267 million Americans who have received their primary Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the CDC. The campaign will focus on reaching seniors and the communities that were hardest hit by Covid-19 by expanding access, increasing awareness and more.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nWe now know what Budweiser will do with the beer it can’t sell at the World Cup\n\nBudweiser plans to ship all the unsold Buds to the country that wins the tournament – assuming that country does not prohibit alcohol consumption.\n\nA group of Indonesian islands is about to hit the auction block\n\nTo some billionaires, islands are like potato chips: you can’t buy just one.\n\nYou can thank ‘The Sims’ for the rise of luxury fashion in gaming\n\nLuxury labels like Balenciaga, Burberry and Louis Vuitton want your avatars to look their very best – for a price of course.\n\nHow to answer those dreaded personal questions at holiday gatherings\n\nHere’s what you should do before the dinner rolls start flying.\n\n‘Love Actually’ cast to reunite for 20th anniversary TV special\n\nAll I want for Christmas is … oh you know the rest.\n\nQUIZ TIME\n\nTurkey is typically the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner.

Let's break that down.\n\nCost of turkey is down in 2023\n\nThe cost of turkey is expected to be lower this year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Although 2023 estimates are not yet available, the Consumer Price Index shows food-at-home prices up 2.4% this year.\n\nEven as the pace of rising grocery prices has slowed in recent months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that grocery prices were up nearly 17% in the past two years.\n\nHow expensive are Thanksgiving side dishes this year?\n\nAlthough turkey prices are decreasing, side dishes are not following similar trends. Thanksgiving side dishes are expected to be 4% more expensive in 2023 compared to last year.\n\nThis is particularly true in the Seattle, Washington metro area where, purchasing two store-bought pumpkin pies will cost around $21, according to MoneyGeek.\n\nThanksgiving cost:Is it cheaper to go to a restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner?

It’s the second year of decline. In 2023, the cost of the market basket of food items decreased 4.5% overall.\n\nIn this year’s survey results, the group noted that those “declines don’t erase dramatic increases that led to a record high cost of $64.06 in 2022 for the traditional meal.”\n\nWhile lower in cost, the traditional Thanksgiving meal still costs 19% more than in 2019, or pre-pandemic.\n\nBringing the cost of this year's meal down is the turkey, or the centerpiece of the traditional Thanksgiving meal. Turkey prices, the group said, are down 6% over last year.\n\nMore:Turkey: Here’s what the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving table will cost this year\n\nAn average price for a 16-pound turkey is $25.67, or $1.68 per pound, according to the AFBF survey.\n\n“The turkey is traditionally the main attraction on the Thanksgiving table and is typically the most expensive part of the meal,” said AFBF Economist Bernt Nelson. “The American turkey flock is the smallest it’s been since 1985 because of avian influenza, but overall demand has also fallen, resulting in lower prices.”\n\nVolunteer shoppers checked prices Nov. 1-7, ahead of traditional holiday sales at many grocery stores. The farm bureau said its volunteers checked prices in person and online using grocery store apps and websites and shopped for the best prices without using special promotions.\n\nNow, as we are closer to Thanksgiving, many grocery stores have frozen turkeys at bargain prices of 49 cents and as low as 33 cents a pound with store loyalty member programs.\n\nFor its informal survey, the farm bureau includes the turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, and pumpkin pie with whipped cream to serve 10 people\n\nNearly all the ingredients in this year’s survey decreased in price. A 14% drop in whole milk was due to favorable weather, the farm bureau noted. And the increase in the dinner rolls and stuffing (both are up 8%) they said was because of “higher labor costs, among other drivers, are increasing the cost of processed food.”\n\nTh farm bureau also noted that cranberry prices are up year-over-year by nearly 12% but were down 18% last year.\n\n“We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America’s families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,” said farm bureau President Zippy Duvall in a news release. “America has one of the most affordable food supplies in the world. In order to maintain that, we need a strong farm bill.\"\n\nIn addition to its list of classic Thanksgiving food items, the farm bureau added boneless ham, russet potatoes, and frozen green beans. Adding those items brought the overall cost to $77.34 for a dinner serving 10 people.\n\nHere are the individual surveyed item prices\n\n16-pound turkey: $25.67 or $1.68 per pound (down 6.1%)\n\n14 ounces of cubed stuffing mix: $4.08 (up 8.2%)\n\n2 frozen pie crusts: $3.40 (down 2.9%)\n\nHalf pint of whipping cream: $1.81 (up 4.7%)\n\n1 pound of frozen peas: $1.73 (down 8.1%)\n\n1 dozen dinner rolls: $4.16 (up 8.4%)\n\nMiscellaneous ingredients to prepare the meal: $3.75 (down 5.1%)\n\n30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix: $4.15 (down 6.5%)\n\n1 gallon of whole milk: $3.21 (down 14.3%)\n\n3 pounds of sweet potatoes: $2.93 (down 26.2%)\n\n1-pound veggie tray (carrots & celery): $.84 (down 6.4%)\n\n12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries: $2.35 (up 11.8%)\n\nBy region, the farm bureau found the Midwest had the third-most affordable cost for the classic meal at $58.90. For the expanded meal, which included the classic plus boneless ham, russet potatoes, and green beans, the cost was $83.04, also ranking the Midwest third most affordable. The most affordable for the classic meal was in the South at $56.81 ($81.07 for expanded) followed by the Northeast at $57.36 ($81.37 for expanded). In the West, the cost jumped to $67.81 for the classic meal and $94.09 for the expanded meal.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press food and restaurant writer Susan Selasky and send food and restaurant news and tips to: sselasky@freepress.com.

Though not declared an official national holiday until 1941, Thanksgiving as we know it was born from the autumn harvest feast early colonists shared with Wampanoag Indians in 1621 in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe customary Thanksgiving dinner of today is an adaptation of what was served in colonial Massachusetts nearly 400 years ago. Historians speculate the original meal included familiar items like beans, carrots, peas, onions, cranberries, and some form of fowl – turkey or otherwise. Unlike today, shellfish, venison, blueberries, and raspberries were also likely served, while potatoes, stuffing, and pumpkin pie were notably absent from the menu.\n\nThe bounty of food served at the first Thanksgiving represented a feat of survival: a triumph of hunting, farming, and cooperation over an unforgiving wilderness in an unfamiliar world.\n\nToday, the full feast can be secured with a short trip to the grocery store and less than $50.\n\nMore:Go ahead and gobble up – the average Thanksgiving dinner costs a bit less than last year\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nFor decades, the American Farm Bureau Federation has tracked the cost of a traditional Thanksgiving meal for a group of 10. The calculation includes the cost of a 16-pound turkey, stuffing, potatoes, dinner rolls, cranberries, and of course, pumpkin pie.\n\nLike everything else, the costs of these items are subject to the laws of supply and demand and do not remain constant.

The survey collects data on the prices of items consumed in a traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10. The data is gathered by a team of volunteer shoppers around the country, and the survey first started in 1986.\n\nThe AFBF found every year that the change in the cost of the Thanksgiving meal tracks closely with the changing price of food at home as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For years prior to 1986, 24/7 Wall St. adjusted the cost of a Thanksgiving meal and its individual components using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for food at home in November from 1947 to 1985.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, the components of a traditional Thanksgiving meal include a 16-pound turkey, 14 oz. of stuffing, 3 pounds of sweet potatoes, a dozen dinner rolls, 16 oz. of frozen peas, 12 oz. of cranberries, a half pound of both carrots and celery, ingredients for two pumpkin pies with whipped cream, and a gallon of milk.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

In St. Louis, Missouri, the same two pies cost $9.\n\nNo turkey needed:How to make a vegetarian Thanksgiving spread, including the main dish\n\nHow much did Thanksgiving ingredients cost in 2023?\n\nAccording to the most recent data available, here is how much individual Thanksgiving ingredients cost in 2023.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/11/13/bird-flu-thanksgiving-turkey-price/75719110/", "title": "Bird flu means your Thanksgiving turkey will cost more this year", "text": "Nathan Bomey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt’s been a foul year for fowl.\n\nThe average price of Thanksgiving turkey has jumped as much as 20% this year, thanks — or no thanks — to the bird flu outbreak that killed some 8 million turkeys, according to the National Turkey Federation.\n\nBut you won't have to reach deep into your pocket to foot the stuffing bill.\n\nPurdue University agricultural economist Corinne Alexander said in a report that grocery prices increased by only 0.8 percent from September 2014 to September 2015 — a lower than normal uptick.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture projected average wholesale price for the Eastern market whole turkey of $1.31 and $1.37 per pound for the final quarter, up from $1.14 in the same period a year ago, according to Purdue.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\n\"This price increase is much larger than typical as a result of the avian influenza outbreak that affected turkey flocks earlier this year,\" Alexander said.\n\nStill, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll hit your pocketbook.\n\nGrocery stores often discount the price of turkeys, viewing them as loss leaders to lure customers into purchasing more profitable items.\n\nFor example, Walmart’s turkey prices will be lower than last year, with a 16-pound premium frozen Butterball selling for 64 cents less than last year, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe AP also reported that pumpkin supplies are expected to last through Thanksgiving despite a 50% drop in yields in Illinois attributed to record rains.\n\nThere’s good news for Thanksgiving travelers, too. Gasoline prices have fallen by nearly 30% since last year, according to Purdue.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/13"}]}

Do you know how much Americans loved mayonnaise and gelatin in the 1950s? It's nauseating just to see those two words in the same sentence.\n\nMore:Amazingly easy creamy green bean casserole from scratch\n\nSo pre-game with some Ritz crackers, Cheez Whiz, a relish board and snack mix, and then dive in to a Thanksgiving meal like mom (or mom’s mom, or mom’s mom’s mom) used to make. Hope you like Jell-O.\n\nGreen bean casserole\n\nThe next time you have to choke down a bite of green bean casserole to make Aunt Agnes happy, you can thank Campbell’s Soup. The company created the tenacious side dish in 1955 to sell more cans of cream of mushroom soup.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nIts charm is in its simplicity: The original recipe calls for green beans, a can of cream of mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce and a generous topping of French fried onions. No casserole dish has been safe since.\n\nJellied vegetable salad\n\nMid-century America sure loved itself some gelatin. Got leftover turkey? Maybe some canned peas or frozen carrots? Mix it with some gelatin, pour it into a mold, and magic! Dark, evil magic.\n\nSweet potato casserole\n\nSweet potatoes at Thanksgiving make sense; the orange root vegetable was a New World tuber popular in the Pacific. But why cover them in marshmallows? Americans have a seemingly boundless appetite for sugar, but there’s more to the history of this sweet casserole than that.\n\nAccording to Saveur magazine, the culprit is good ol’ American advertising. When marshmallows were first mass-produced (and therefore cheaper), Angelus Marshmallows created and distributed its own book of marshmallow-inspired recipes – including marshmallow-topped mashed sweet potatoes.\n\nMore:Try this easy and classic sweet potato casserole with pecan topping\n\nSpam\n\nThe horrors of canned meats are legion. This popular army ration became a mid-century staple and inspired innumerable pork-based culinary atrocities. One vintage Spam ad suggests “Spam birds”: slices of Spam packed with stuffing, fastened with toothpicks and baked (served, of course, as everything was back then, with a hefty helping of peas).\n\nCreamed onions\n\nOnions as a stand-alone side dish have fallen out of favor in American cuisine, but the pungent vegetable used to be a star of the Thanksgiving table. It was so popular an ingredient in Europe, according to the National Onion Association, the first Pilgrims brought onions with them on the Mayflower. Creamed onions were a staple: plump little pearl onions sautéed in a buttery cream sauce.\n\nVenison\n\nWant to go ultra retro this Thanksgiving? Hunt a deer. While surviving literature confirms there were wild turkeys on the first Thanksgiving table in 1621, they weren’t the centerpieces our 20-pound Butterballs are today.\n\nTV dinners\n\nThe legend goes that Swanson drastically miscalculated America’s appetite for Thanksgiving turkey one year – and then cleverly repurposed its surplus to popularize “TV dinners” in the U.S. Whether or not that’s true is up for debate, but the tale sure does make spongy slabs of turkey and thawed peas go down easier. The price when it debuted in 1954? Ninety-eight cents.\n\nJell-O salad\n\nNow it’s rare to see a Jell-O salad outside of wakes and church basements, but there was a time when you couldn’t walk through an American kitchen without ending up with a mouthful of the instant dessert. Because, as the slogan went, “There’s always room for Jell-O.”\n\nInvented in 1897, instant gelatin was a triumph of domestic science: It was quick and easy to prepare, a product of machine packaging that capitalized on new refrigeration technology. It may have fallen out of favor, but there’s still just something zen about chopped fruit suspended in wiggly, jiggly gelatin.\n\nLibby’s Pumpkin Pie\n\nNot all vintage Thanksgiving recipes are best left in the dustbin of history. If there’s any dish as essential as turkey to the American Thanksgiving table, it’s pumpkin pie. Chances are, you make yours with a can of Libby’s pumpkin pie filling. The company has been printing its signature, foolproof pumpkin pie recipe on its cans since the 1950s. Decades have passed, but that nine-ingredient recipe remains blessedly frozen in time.\n\nMore:Pumpkin pie with harvest-spiced cream & caramelized almonds\n\nReach the reporter at bvandenburgh@gannett.com.

First Ave.; 602-980-0788, barcoaphx.com\n\nBarcoa is a cocktail bar built around celebrating Sonoran spirits with a massive list of tequilas, mezcals, bacanora, sotol, raicilla and distilado de agave available on their own, in flights and shaken into cocktails. From straightforward margaritas to more unusual tipples like a banana-infused mezcal Negroni, an elote old-fashioned and a bright green pistachio milk and mezcal concoction, the drinks are boozy and well-balanced odes to the spirits they contain. Many of the bottles come from small Mexican producers, which means you won’t find them anywhere else. Hidden below a more casual cantina, this basement bar welcomes agave nerds and newcomers alike. There’s always something new to taste or learn. — Felicia Campbell, The Arizona Republic\n\nRead a full review of Barcoa.\n\nBoycott Bar | Phoenix, Arizona\n\nDetails: 4301 N. Seventh Ave.; 602-825-6240, boycottbarphx.com\n\nFeatured in “The Lesbian Bar Project” – a documentary by filmmakers Erica Rose and Elina Street that chronicles the decline of lesbian bars and celebrates the ones that remain – Boycott Bar in Phoenix’s Melrose District is one of only 33 lesbian bars in the United States. Audrey Corley opened the cozy, dimly lit bar in 2004 because, while there were several gay bars in Phoenix, no places catered specifically to women. She wanted to offer a safe, inclusive experience for the community. In the years since, it’s become a Phoenix staple for karaoke, sip-and-paint classes, themed dance parties and a place just to have a drink in a lively watering hole where all are welcome. — Bahar Anooshahr, The Arizona Republic\n\nRead a full review of Boycott Bar.\n\nDeer Park Tavern | Newark, Delaware\n\nDetails: 108 W. Main St.; 302-369-9414, deerparktavern.com\n\nLegend has it that poet Edgar Allan Poe visited the St. Patrick's Inn – now home to Newark's famous Deer Park Tavern – slipped in the mud and put a curse on the building. True story? Who knows, but it's a good tale – and a raven, a nod to Poe's poem, is part of the tavern's logo. No one pays the Poe curse any mind. The landmark, popular with University of Delaware students and town locals, was established in 1851 and has become the best-known watering hole on campus for generations of UD students. The former hotel is always a quintessential college bar experience, although some locals love tossing back a few cold ones in the downstairs side area known as the \"townie bar.\" — Patricia Talorico, Delaware News Journal\n\nRead a full review of Deer Park Tavern.\n\nFlora-Bama | Perdido Key, Florida\n\nDetails: 17401 Perdido Key Drive; 251-980-5118, florabama.com\n\nThe world-famous bar on the Florida-Alabama state line can capture almost anyone’s heart, from greats like Kenny Chesney and Jimmy Buffett to the bikini-wearing, Bushwhacker-drinking barflies who have claimed Flora-Bama as their watering hole since 1964. Decades of Sharpie signatures line the bar’s wooden walls, and a string of well-worn bras sags over the main performing stage. While live music is a main attraction, the Flora-Bama’s calendar of annual events has patrons packing the sandy beaches in April for the Interstate Mullet Toss and gathering around the table for a Thanksgiving potluck. While Flora-Bama screams down-home beach bar, you can splurge on dinner next door at the Flora-Bama Yacht Club with waterfront views, award-winning chefs and local seafood. — Brittany Misencik, Pensacola News Journal\n\nRead a full review of Flora-Bama.\n\nThe Gator Club | Sarasota, Florida\n\nDetails: 1490 Main St.; 941-366-5969, thegatorclub.com\n\nLocated in downtown Sarasota near the city’s famed Bayfront, The Gator Club is a two-story bar and nightclub boasting more than 110 years of history, including bootleg whiskey, illegal gambling, an upstairs brothel and the kind of spirits that can’t be contained by a glass. Upon entering, guests encounter two bars and an elevated stage frequented by bands such as the beloved reggae act Jah Movement. Patrons are advised to proceed with caution up the rickety old staircase to the second floor, where DJs transform a former living room into a pulsating dance floor. In the back of the same floor, a cozy bar offers high-end hooch, the madam’s teller’s cage and the setting for The Gator Club’s scariest ghost stories. — Wade Tatangelo, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nRead a full review of The Gator Club.\n\nSam's Silver Circle | Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nDetails: 1102 Fletcher Ave.; 317-636-6288, samssilvercircle.com\n\nA floor-to-ceiling mosaic of license plates, beverage advertisements and Sports Illustrated covers celebrates nearly a century of slinging hot pizza and pouring cold beer at Sam’s Silver Circle. Anchored at the corner of Fletcher Avenue and Shelby Street since 1938, the Fountain Square staple once attracted the region’s best darts players. Now, it’s a quintessential neighborhood haunt stocked with seemingly inflation-proof beer and plenty of greasy food to soak it up. Karaoke, trivia and bingo nights fall once a week, and there are still always darts to be thrown. The bar’s unofficial slogan, “Follow me to Sam’s,” is one of the best things you can hear on a late-night pub crawl. — Bradley Hohulin, The Indianapolis Star\n\nRead a full review of Sam's Silver Circle.\n\nHello, Marjorie | Des Moines, Iowa\n\nDetails: 717 Locust St.; 515-369-2296, hellomarjorie.com\n\n“The prettiest girls in the world live in Des Moines,” boasts a pink LED sign hanging over a fireplace. The quote from Jack Kerouac’s 1957 novel “On the Road” defines Hello, Marjorie, a step back in time to the 1950s when midcentury modern decor ruled. The retro cocktail lounge in the former Des Moines Register & Tribune building from owner Nick Tillinghast serves some of the most creative cocktails in the Midwest. Tillinghast carved out conversational seating areas outfitted with retro couches in golds and hunter greens, low-slung chairs and buffets decorated with old books, globes and lamps. Order the namesake Marjorie, made with elderberry and spiced pear in vodka. A separate speakeasy, Good News, Darling, sits in the back of the space with its own distinctive menu and vibe. — Susan Stapleton, The Des Moines Register\n\nRead a full review of Hello, Marjorie.\n\nNeat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop | Louisville, Kentucky\n\nDetails: 1139 Bardstown Road; 502-690-3254, neatbottlebar.com\n\nIn a town known as Bourbon City, bourbon bars abound. Neat, established in 2019, found a niche: Tourists and locals are drawn to this place on a busy Louisville street, where the dark orange and black exterior welcomes you in with signs saying “vintage bourbon.” As its name suggests, this place doesn’t mess around with the good stuff. They might have one of the best old-fashioneds in town. This is a place with an impressive collection and bartenders ready to show it off. — Amanda Hancock, The Courier Journal\n\nRead a full review of Neat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop.\n\nIntracoastal Club | Houma, Louisiana\n\nDetails: 8448 E. Main St.; 985-746-5028, intracoastal-club.edan.io\n\nIn the sinking bayou city of Houma, the Intracoastal Club hosts experimental bands from around the world. Hurricane Ida in 2021 left its mark on the bar’s exterior, and repairs still aren't finished. But patrons who step inside won't notice, as they are transported to a psychedelic space of disco balls and paper jellyfish. On the walls, local artists’ works hang alongside old magazine clippings and portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte, Abraham Lincoln, Keith Richards, Blondie, James Brown and Dracula. The drinks are simple, but the shows, ranging from drag and performance artists to bands of all genre, are not. Bands that have performed here include Quintron and Miss Pussycat, Paisley Fields, Louis Michot, Daikaiju, and Jeff \"J.D.\" Pinkus. — Colin Campo, Houma Courier\n\nRead a full review of the Intracoastal Club.\n\nL Street Tavern | Boston, Massachusetts\n\nDetails: 658 E. Eighth St.; 617-752-4947, lsttavernsouthie.com\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, an Irish pub on the corner of L and East Eighth streets in South Boston gained worldwide fame. Scouts chose L Street Tavern for scenes in what would become an Academy Award-winning movie, “Good Will Hunting,” starring Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. The same high-top table where one of the most hilarious scenes was filmed remains, covered with movie photos and historic Oscar night memorabilia. Tourists from around the world visit, said co-owner Mark Medico. Seven wide-screen televisions line the wood-paneled walls for Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins and Patriots fans to watch games while drinking L Street’s most popular drink: Guinness in a 20-ounce glass. — Joanna K. Tzouvelis, Wicked Local\n\nRead a full review of the L Street Tavern.\n\nParamita Sound | Detroit, Michigan\n\nDetails: 1517 Broadway St.; paramita.xyz\n\nFrom a quaint space in downtown Detroit, Paramita Sound is a place that shines not solely for its bar program or its selection of wines, but for its ability to bring communities together. The Black-owned wine bar and record shop with just eight proper seats gathers guests across generations and cultural backgrounds. Live DJs – both local and national, up-and-coming and acclaimed – pack the space with a lively crowd of imbibers sipping sorrel cocktails or Michigan reds and dancing the Detroit Hustle to just about any track. When the room lined with old records and a photo of Paramita’s humble beginnings out of an old home in the West Village neighborhood fills, the party spills into the streets of Detroit to continue into the wee hours of the night. — Lyndsay C. Green, Detroit Free Press\n\nRead a full review of Paramita Sound.\n\nThe Apothecary at Brent's Drugs | Jackson, Mississippi\n\nDetails: 655 Duling Ave.; 601-366-3427, apothecaryjackson.com\n\nLocated in Jackson's historic Fondren neighborhood, Brent's Drugs is a classic drug store that's been around since 1946 and serves ice cream favorites, milkshakes and diner comfort foods. But that's not the only thing that's special about the drug store. Toward the back is the entrance to a bar called The Apothecary, which occupies the space where the pharmacy storeroom used to be. The Apothecary is one of the most popular bars in Jackson and the place to be for a fun night out with friends or just a quick stop for an after-work drink. The bartenders specialize in classic-inspired cocktails such as the Adult Swim, a Caribbean Negroni with banana rum and coconut Campari. — Kiara Fleming, Clarion Ledger\n\nRead a full review of The Apothecary.\n\nWonder Bar | Asbury Park, New Jersey\n\nDetails: 1213 Ocean Ave.; 732-455-3767, wonderbarasburypark.com\n\nThere are rock 'n' roll stars onstage, and dogs in the courtyard for Yappy Hour, but manager Debbie DeLisa says it's the community that makes the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park so special. DeLisa and Lance Larson have been managing the Ocean Avenue watering hole for nearly 25 years, and they’ve solidified the Wonder Bar's position as a city landmark. When music is not playing, customers sit at the big circular bar, built that way in the '60s so folks can get to know each other across the room. The popular drink is the Debbie D, named after DeLisa. It has Ketel One Botanicals Cucumber and Mint with club soda and fresh muddled mint. “It's really refreshing in the summer,” DeLisa said. One of the regulars is Bruce Springsteen, who has performed several times at the club but mostly he blends in as well as he can. He's a fan of Yappy Hour, where customers bring their dogs to play in the adjacent courtyard. It's unknown whether he's tried a Debbie D. — Chris Jordan, Asbury Park Press\n\nRead a full review of Wonder Bar.\n\nTierney's Tavern | Montclair, New Jersey\n\nDetails: 136 Valley Road; tierneystavern.com\n\nVintage wooden architecture and secret-menu burgers are the name of the game at Montclair’s 90-year-old community center. Locals – from college kids to boomers – have gathered in the classic Irish bar for generations, often accompanied by family (and, sometimes, celebrities). At one point, “The Sopranos” filmed an episode in the nostalgic space, and at another time, William H. Macy and Emma Roberts enjoyed a drink among its twinkling green lights and hanging sports jerseys. The intrigue of the Hollywood elite, despite the tavern’s unassuming digs, comes as no surprise, though, in a place that has established itself as North Jersey’s “Cheers,” but with better food. — Kara VanDooijeweert, The Record and northjersey.com\n\nRead a full review of Tierney's Tavern.\n\nRadio Social | Rochester, New York\n\nDetails: 20 Carlson Road; 585-244-1484, radio-social.com\n\nIn a city that has a strong craft cocktail scene, the most weirdly wonderful place to drink is Radio Social. It’s a 42,000-square-foot mashup of two bars, an upscale Middle Eastern restaurant, a pizza/burger joint and a 34-lane bowling alley. You can play classic games like cornhole and shuffleboard both indoors and on a spacious back lawn. One cocktail bar features flavors that complement the Middle Eastern fare, while the other leans toward playful concoctions served in vessels compatible with swinging a ping pong paddle. You can also get a Genesee Light, the easy drinking local lager. The colorful, retro vibe is a nod to the building’s history of making radios during World War II. It has one of the best brunches in town. — Tracy Schuhmacher, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nRead a full review of Radio Social.\n\nSaints and Scholars | Yonkers, New York\n\nDetails: 790 McLean Ave.; 914-457-5550, instagram.com/saintsandscholars\n\nThere aren't many bars in Westchester County with floral wallpaper, disco balls and chandeliers, including one in the ladies' room. But Saints and Scholars, which opened in 2018, defies expectations. What looks like your typical Irish bar on the outside is full of surprises, starting with a black and white checkered floor, a red and purple backlit bar, a coffered ceiling and a vibrant atmosphere that changes from sedate to sultry as the night goes on. The cocktails are similarly unique (try the Porn Star Martini!) and can be served in a jumbo glass (which easily serves four) or in a miniature bathtub complete with a rubber ducky. Irish-born owner Aidan Loughran, who loves chatting with his customers, has also made elevated food a priority. Cash only. — Jeanne Muchnick, The Journal News\n\nRead a full review of Saints and Scholars.\n\nThe Crow & Quill ∣ Asheville, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 106 N. Lexington Ave.; thecrowandquill.com\n\nVictorian meets gothic at the speakeasy-style bar and local haunt The Crow & Quill. The craft cocktail bar has an air of mystery with a door with no signage; guests must be in the know to know where to go. The eclectic array of antique decor and furniture, dark-wood fixtures and a flag emblazoned with the emblem of a fictitious secret society set the ambiance. Founder Casey Campfield opened the downtown bar in 2014 as a local hangout, and tourists who've stumbled upon its door have made it a favorite, too. The Crow & Quill offers intimate corners, rousing nights of live music with jazzy swing bands, and classic and signature cocktails made from a library of more than 800 whiskeys and 1,000 spirits. ― Tiana Kennell, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nRead a full review of The Crow & Quill.\n\nOcean Grill and Tiki Bar | Carolina Beach, North Carolina\n\nDetails: 1211 S. Lake Park Blvd.; 910-707-0049, oceangrilltiki.com\n\nOcean views, salt air and tiki drinks? Yes, this spot has the laid-back, surf-inspired vibe you want in a beach bar. The restaurant side at the Golden Sands Motel has an upstairs dining room with panoramic views. But a mini vacation is a few steps away on the remnants of Center Pier, damaged by a hurricane in 1996. When it’s time for tiki business, bartenders open the hut’s plywood flaps to serve cold beer and cocktails such as a mojito, Dark ‘n’ Stormy or the house-favorite Noserider. And the staff will even bring you fish tacos or a sandwich from the restaurant. In the summer, the magical tiki shows bring both touring artists and local bands to the rock out on the end of the pier. — Allison Ballard, Wilmington StarNews\n\nRead a full review of Ocean Grill and Tiki Bar.\n\nLaw Bird | Columbus, Ohio\n\nDetails: 740 S. High St.; 614-636-1053, lawbirdbar.com\n\nEven as Law Bird introduces cocktails with pickled-carrot brine or seaweed-infused mezcal, curates Wednesday night hot dogs with the same finesse as its mixology and turns into a tiki bar in the middle of December, one thing stays constant. There’s a pink neon sign that says, “Not Governed by Reason.” Law Bird, a cocktail bar just outside downtown Columbus, remakes itself regularly through changes in drink menus, bar snacks and decor. In the past year alone, it has gone through five evolutions that include 1990s vintage, Japanese city pop and galactic disco. Customer favorites reappear, and classics such as $5 mini-martinis endure. It’s a small, never-crowded space that takes reservations but leaves half its seating open for walk-ins. — Bob Vitale, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nRead a full review of Law Bird.\n\nLongfellow | Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nDetails: 1233 Clay St.; 513-307-4379, longfellowbar.com\n\nOrder a classic cocktail, an amaro or a pilsner at Longfellow, and it won’t take long to realize why this place is special. Your epiphany might come as your mind goes deep into an old song by Ralph Stanley or New Order playing on the well-curated playlist, when you strike up a conversation with a stranger (it’s rare to come here without making a new friend) or when you look outside the bar’s double-hung windows and fall in love with the Italianate townhomes and cathedrals that surround you. As the night wears on, the bar becomes a beacon for restaurant workers finishing up their shifts and looking for a shot and a beer, or couples out for a nightcap after dinner. You can eat here, too. A rotating menu features modern takes on old-school bar snacks, including radishes with salt and butter, German-style meat platters and tomato soup. All of them are wonderful. — Keith Pandolfi, The Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nRead a full review of Longfellow.\n\nEdna's | Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nDetails: 5137 Classen Circle; 405-840-3339, ednasokc.com\n\nFor 35 years, patrons have adorned the walls and ceilings of Edna's with dollar bills. At this point, there are few spots remaining without colorfully decorated bills stapled to them. But when namesake Edna Scott opened her bar in 1989, there was no indication it would become so beloved or the origin point of a cocktail combining Coors Light, orange juice and amaretto – The Lunchbox – that many have tried to mimic. The bar was once the location of a Keith Urban music video, and Jimmy Fallon and Questlove were even served Lunchboxes by an Oklahoma chef on “The Tonight Show.” Still owned by Scott's family, offering up a tasty bar menu and having served more than 2 million Lunchboxes, Edna's remains a cornerstone of Oklahoma City's bar scene. — JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman\n\nRead a full review of Edna's.\n\nHey Love | Portland, Oregon\n\nDetails: 920 E. Burnside St.; 503-206-6223, heylovepdx.com\n\nIn a city of perpetual rain, Hey Love is Portland's sunny escape. Fenced in by tropical plants creating a cabana-like ambiance, the bar inside the Jupiter Hotel encapsulates the city's eclectic spirit. A funky, fresh playlist enlivens the space. The team of owners brings decades of experience in the industry and has crafted an experience that all can enjoy, including an ADA-accommodating bar top. There are food options for most dietary restrictions for happy hour, dinner and weekend brunch, plus an almost unending list of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The bar continuously participates in fundraisers and causes, making it the community's bar. — Em Chan, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nRead a full review of Hey Love.\n\nBloomsday Cafe | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nDetails: 414 S. Second St.; 267-319-8018, bloomsdaycafe.com\n\nOn a cobblestone street lined with old trees, this charming pub dresses like the hottest wine bar in town, but the staff will remember your name, your seating preference and your drink. Bloomsday has a long list of natural wines, ciders, orange wines and bubbly from the United States and abroad. If you’re not an oenophile, bartenders will be happy to offer their favorite vermouth from the marble and crystal bar, or make you the Bloomsday Citywide cocktail, a fun spin on the Philly classic that combines a different beer and vermouth each month. Wine clubs, book clubs, tea parties and a menu of brunch classics keep this wine pub filled with locals year-round. — Annemarie Dooling, USA TODAY\n\nRead a full review of Bloomsday.\n\nPreservation Pub | Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 28 Market Square; 865-524-2224, scruffycity.com/preservation-pub\n\nThere are two kinds of “Pubby Buddies.” There’s the signature $5 menu item at Preservation Pub – a shot of whiskey and a PBR – and then there are the friends you make while dancing to jam band music in the smoke-filled first floor and while sharing drinks from the rooftop “shot shack” trailer (or the magic beer tree). Owner Scott West, whose career is back on track after a money laundering conviction, considers the divey Preservation Pub and its nightly live music to be the “heart of the heart” – that is, the pulse that makes Knoxville’s Market Square pedestrian plaza come alive as one of the most-visited parts of the Scruffy City. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News\n\nRead a full review of Preservation Pub.\n\nThe Lipstick Lounge | Nashville, Tennessee\n\nDetails: 1400 Woodland St.; 615-226-6343, thelipsticklounge.com\n\nLipstick Lounge is an icon of once-gritty East Nashville. Now pricey homes surround it. But the bar, which opened in 2002, serves as a reminder of when the neighborhood was less polished. When it was a haven for artists and musicians who hadn't yet struck it big. When it was proudly home to a come-as-you-are attitude. Lipstick Lounge is still that. It's a colorful, raucous good time, with thumping music and costumes everywhere, even on a Sunday afternoon. Customers come for a huge menu of hangover drinks like the peach schnapps-based Flying Phyllis Diller, an ode to the queen of one-liners whose gay fan base is immense. Yes, Lipstick Lounge is a gay bar, but foremost it's \"a bar for humans,\" its owners are fond of saying. It's a bar for anyone who likes to have fun in a welcoming but wild atmosphere. — Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean\n\nRead a full review of The Lipstick Lounge.\n\nSahara Lounge | Austin, Texas\n\nDetails: 1413 Webberville Road; 512-927-0700, saharalounge.com\n\nSahara Lounge sits at the eastern edge of Austin and at the heart of a community that still represents Austin at its best: funky, soulful, eclectic and diverse. The ramshackle bar owned by musicians Eileen Bristol and her son, Topaz McGarrigle, sometimes feels like it might fall down when regular Africa Night or Body Rock ATX parties pump at full throttle. Bartenders quench the thirst of clubgoers with cold Sahara Slants, the house’s namesake cocktail made with the Ghanaian spirit akpeteshie. Looking for a beer without the bass drop? Before the show, you can soak in the space’s musical history, documented with old concert posters, or head to a table out back, where the conversation flows like the Quan Yin fountain honoring the Bodhisattva of Compassion. — Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman\n\nRead a full review of Sahara Lounge.\n\nBryant's Cocktail Lounge | Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nDetails: 1579 S. Ninth St.; 414-383-2620, bryantscocktaillounge.com\n\nAt Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, owner John Dye is most proud when customers liken his bar to a museum. It first opened in 1937 and serves drinks from every decade it has been open: Depression-era cocktails like rail splitters and sidecars, hurricanes made popular during World War II and colorful cosmopolitans popular in the 1990s. The bar’s bestsellers are ice cream drinks like pink squirrels (rumored to have been invented at Bryant’s) and grasshoppers, along with the Wisconsin old-fashioned. The bar’s interior was well preserved until a fire destroyed it in 1971. The owner at that time rebuilt it as a dimly lit, vintage 1950s cocktail lounge sparing no expense, according to Dye. The lounge has been preserved since, giving Bryant’s its historic charm today. — Jordyn Noennig, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nRead a full review of Bryant's Cocktail Lounge.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2018/08/01/restaurants-classics-delaware-dining/791705002/", "title": "20 eateries (and more) that are Delaware classics", "text": "The loss of such landmark Delaware eateries as Leo & Jimmy's in Wilmington, Dover's Kirby & Holloway, and more recently Arner's Restaurant in New Castle had us thinking about longtime First State eating establishments still operating.\n\nWe've come up with a list of 20 (and really more) classic Delaware places that are cherished, hometown favorites.\n\nTo be clear, classic eateries don't necessarily mean the state's best restaurants. That's another list.\n\nThese cultural icons have endured for decades for several, sentimental reasons. Mainly, loyal standbys don't change much or worry about being trendy or hip. They emphasize the customer experience, appease regulars but still grow their base, and continue to create fond memories.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nDegnars Greenhill Deli & Pizzeria\n\n2501 W. Fourth St., Wilmington; (302) 656-3663\n\nThis city sub shop has been in operation since 1949. First located at Greenhill Avenue and Fourth Street, it moved to its present location more than 40 years ago. The Degnar family added their name to the business within the past five years or so.\n\nFamily photos clutter one wall of the tiny space, and the counter is shoulder level. There's no seating except for three umbrella-covered picnic tables on the sidewalk.\n\nThe slap-slap, clang-clang of spatulas hitting the flat top when someone makes a cheesesteak is the shop's soundtrack. You can get pasta as well as pizza and stromboli. \"A corner piece, please, dear,\" says a customer pointing to the tomato pie.\n\nRegulars don't even look at the posted menu for the hot and cold sandwiches packed into white paper bags, though they might glance at the daily, handwritten specials. The shop's hours are scribbled on a paper plate hanging at the counter.\n\nWhat to order? Homemade iced tea and lemonade, breakfast pizza, chicken salad, one of the daily BLT specials, cheesesteaks, Italian subs.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Takeout with outdoor seating also is the norm at Walt's Flavor Crisp Chicken Express, 103 N. Lincoln St. in Wilmington. It makes the same fried chicken created in 1973 by the late Harry W. Sheppard at his old Vandever Avenue shop.\n\nMrs. Robino's\n\n520 N. Union St., Wilmington; (302) 652-9223\n\nDiners have been twirling forks through plates of pasta and using bread to sop up the sauce at this vintage Italian-American \"red gravy\" restaurant since 1940.\n\nThe Grand Dame in the city's Little Italy neighborhood was founded by Tresilla Robino, who started the business in the basement of her Howland Street home. She later moved to Union Street.\n\nStill family-owned, Mrs. Robino's honors its longtime patrons, a group fiercely protective of their favorite establishment, by posting their photos near the front door.\n\nWhat to order? Wedding soup, chopped antipasto salad and a combination of homemade spaghetti and ravioli. Check out crab nights on Thursdays.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Ristorante Attilio, a family-owned Italian-American eatery at 1900 Lancaster Ave. in Wilmington since 1985. Get the crunchy hot peppers, spaghetti with white clam sauce, homemade lasagna and Tartufo dessert.\n\n2600 Concord Pike, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 478-2165\n\nGenerations of patrons have making pit stops at “The Pit” for more than 60 years. This archetypal hamburger and shake joint, founded in September 1956, was modeled after The Dog House in New Castle. Initially, it had a long counter with a view of Concord Pike and about four tables. It's grown over the years but hasn't changed much since saddle shoes were in style.\n\nPresident Obama came for a visit in July 2014 on the advice from Vice President Joe Biden and his late son Beau, who were frequent visitors. The only-in-Delaware touches include naming sundaes after area high schools.\n\nWhat to order? Onion rings; The Pit Deluxe charbroiled cheeseburger; a black-and-white milkshake; and the Kitchen Sink, a monster sundae with 20 scoops of ice cream.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Burgers are king at \"the Pit,\" and steak sandwiches are the stars of the Claymont Steak Shop. The flagship Claymont shop at 3526 Philadelphia Pike was founded by Greek cousins Bob Hionis and Sam Demetratos in 1966.\n\n510 N. Union St., Wilmington; (302) 571-8929\n\nEvery state has foods that it's known for: Maryland has crabs, Pennsylvania has the cheesesteak and Delaware has the Bobbie.\n\nThe iconic \"Thanksgiving on a roll\" was invented by the late Wilmington native Lois Margolet. She launched the Capriotti's Sandwich Shop chain in 1976 in the Little Italy neighborhood where she grew up. Margolet named the mom-and-pop sub shop after her grandfather Philip Capriotti.\n\nThe specialty sandwich that established Capriotti's is the famed Bobbie. It's made with pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and mayonnaise. The dish was a recreation of a sandwich served to the Margolets by their Aunt Bobbie. The national restaurant chain now has 106 locations in 17 states.\n\nWhat to order? The Bobbie, of course. We also recommend the turkey sub and the Capastrami, hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and coleslaw on a roll.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Casapulla's shop at 514 Casapulla Ave. in Elsmere, has been making meaty Italian subs since 1956. It had been considered Capriotti's longtime rival, although the families were good friends.\n\n\"The only problem between us was that Capriotti's and Casapulla's almost sound the same,\" Lou Casapulla told The News Journal in 2017. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nGrotto Pizza\n\n36 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3278\n\nSo much nostalgia, and debate, surrounds Grotto Pizza. We're convinced the best slice is served with a side of salty sea air. Go to the original Rehoboth Avenue home, a few steps from the ocean, to enjoy pies that feature a blend of cheeses (they won't say what kind) and tomato sauce applied in a signature swirl.\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering what those regulars are doing with the napkins, dabbing the top of a slice to soak up \"pizza juice\" is a Grotto's tradition.\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in 1960 by Dominick Pulieri, along with his brother-in-law, Joe, and sister Mary Jean Paglianite. At the first take-out stand, pizza slices sold for 20 cents a piece. A second Grotto Pizza on the Rehoboth boardwalk opened in 1963. The chain now has more than 20 locations.\n\nWhat to order? A traditional oven pizza. Sizes include a 12-inch regular or a 16-inch large. For toppings, we'd go with pepperoni or Pennsylvania mushrooms.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Nicola Pizza at 8 N. First St. in Rehoboth has been around since 1971. Owner Nicholas Caggiano gave Delaware's pizza culture the Nic-o-Boli, the First State's version of the stromboli.\n\n2020 Naamans Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-3000\n\nOwner Xavier Teixido's classy, convivial restaurant is modern and innovative, but it also focuses on old-school classics. It offers the state's best prime rib, along with seafood, steaks and a wine list deeper than Barry White's dulcet tones.\n\nBuilt on the bones of old Admiral Inn, it has roots tracing back to 1939 when it was the Log Cabin. Harry's has been operating since 1988 with Teixido purchasing it after a split with a former partner in 1993. It's not named after a particular person. Teixido once joked, \"Who doesn't love a Harry?\"\n\nWhat to order? Oysters, hot crab and artichoke dip, aged steaks, prime rib au jus medium rare, soft shell crabs (seasonal), and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Walter's Steakhouse at 802 N. Union St. Since the early 1990s, owner John Walter Constantinou has continued the legacy of his father George's long-gone Constantinou's House of Beef.\n\n1722 N. Scott St., Wilmington; (302) 658-8625\n\nOwner August Muzzi has been standing in front of the grill at this old-school lunch counter tucked into the city's Forty Acres neighborhood since 1967.\n\nIt's a cash-only establishment, though there is an ATM machine where the old candy counter used to be. Almost nothing changes at Angelo's and that's the way Muzzi and his longtime patrons like it. The last renovation was in the early 1990s when booths replaced tables. It's open for breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday, and from 7 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. It can be tough beating the regulars to one of the 12 counter stools.\n\nWhat to order? A fried egg and meat breakfast sandwich, grilled cheese and Campbell's tomato soup, Italian sausage sandwich, root beer float, Angie's burger.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Libby's Restaurant at 227 W. Eighth St. in downtown Wilmington is sometimes called \"the 'Cheers' of food.\" Breakfast is served all day at this cash-only establishment that's been in operation since 1982.\n\n1200 N. Dupont Highway, New Castle; (302) 328-5380\n\nLou Sloan and his three brothers opened The Dog House in 1952. At that time, the four-lane highway where the Wilmington Manor eatery sits at Stahl Avenue was only two lanes with trees growing in the median.\n\nThe Sloans are no longer the owners, but split, foot-long hot dogs, cooked on a flat-top grill remain The Dog House's signature dish.\n\nCustomers still find refuge at the cash-only roadside eatery that features the same long, throwback counter with 17 stools that has been in place for 56 years.\n\nWhat to order? A foot-long dog, a cheese dog with chili, a hot dog with sauerkraut or maybe even a cheesesteak.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Deerhead Hot Dogs has been a part of Delaware's eating landscape since 1935. We sometimes hit the 620 S. Maryland Ave. site in Wilmington for a double dog with \"secret\" sauce. There's also a Deerhead Hot Dogs food truck.\n\n4866 N. Dupont Highway, Smyrna; (302) 653-4200\n\nIf you see a line at Helen's, and you will because it's such a popular place, be patient and don't leave. It moves fast.\n\nHelen's home since 1983 has been a squat, white building with bars on the outside windows. Keep an open mind if this is your first visit. Some of the best eateries don't always impress at first glance.\n\nIt's home to the quintessential Delaware breakfast. While most people assume that's scrapple, and Helen's has it, but, as the name suggests, order the sausage. It's deep-fried and it's terrific.\n\nYou can take your meal to-go or sit in the small seating area decorated with Elvis Presley memorabilia. Helen's is an early morning establishment. Really early. It opens at 4 a.m. and the staff calls it a day at noon, Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nWhat to order? Double sausage sandwich with fried peppers and onions; scrapple and egg sandwich; bone-in jumbo pork chop sandwich; home fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Royal Treat in Rehoboth Beach is a family-run, cash-only, seasonal breakfast and ice cream parlor that's been at 4 Wilmington Ave., near the boardwalk, for almost 30 years.\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave., Wilmington, 302-575-9651\n\nClubby, warm and definitely old-school Wilmington, the Columbus Inn got its current name in 1953, but its roots go back to the 18th century.\n\nOnce considered \"a men's club for the clubless,\" a longtime joke has been that more business deals were made at the Columbus Inn bar than in offices\n\nRenovations in 2010 by the Capano family, after the restaurant was closed for three years, made it much more inviting and modern.\n\nIn a nod to the past, brass nameplates on walls honor longtime customers who have died. The tavern area still has the walnut, horseshoe-shaped bar where for 65 years a congregation of regulars has rested elbows, swapped gossip and sipped cocktails and brews.\n\nWhat to order? Corn and crab chowder, the tavern burger, house-cut fries, crab cakes, the 8-ounce filet.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Jessop's Tavern in Old New Castle is housed in a structure originally built in 1674. In the 1950s, it was known as Captain’s Log Restaurant and it became The Green Frog Tavern in the 1970s. It's been Jessop's since 1996.\n\n101 N. Maryland Ave., Richardson Park, Wilmington; (302) 655-8772\n\nIndia Palace was one of the first Indian restaurants in the state when the Kumar family-run business opened in 1991 not far from the Five Points Volunteer Fire Co.\n\nIt quickly developed a loyal following due to the graciousness of Pinky Kumar, who runs the front of the house, and her husband, Sushil Kumar, who makes the delectable homemade naan in a clay tandoor oven.\n\nThere’s a small lot out front of the brick building, but parking isn’t all that easy. The decor, old-fashioned pine paneling, and a mix of tables and booths for about 50 people looks as though it hasn’t been updated since the restaurant opened.\n\nWhat to order? The buffet lunch; roti (homemade bread), bayngan bhurta (roasted eggplant), marinated sliced lamb, and tandoori mixed grill.\n\nWhat's similar to it? India Palace helped change Delaware's dining scene in 1991 and so did Toscana, Dan Butler's Trolley Square eatery which opened the same year. Butler is credited with setting a new standard for high-quality Italian restaurants.\n\n42 W. 11th St., Wilmington; (302) 594-3154\n\nNo contest: The Green Room inside of the 1913 Italian Renaissance hotel in downtown Wilmington is the most majestic dining room in the state.\n\nWhile the historic Hotel du Pont is no longer owned by the DuPont Co., it is still considered one of the most lavish hotels of America's Gilded Age.\n\nSomehow, you sit up straighter when dining at the Green Room (which, incidentally, has a crimson decor). Sunday brunch is pretty awesome and afternoon tea isn't bad.\n\nThe Green name refers to a family, not the color of the dining room. The hotel has already undergone some changes since The Buccini/Pollin Group acquired the building in 2017, and The Green Room is expected to do the same.\n\nWhat to order? Foie gras, crab cakes, any dessert and definitely the macaroons, the restaurant's signature baked treat. Go for Sunday brunch.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Dan and Missy Lickle brought fancy, but not posh, dining to Hockessin in 1980 with the opening of the Back Burner Restaurant. For a more lavish experience, go to Lickles' Krazy Kat's at The Inn at Montchanin Village.\n\nThe Deer Park Tavern\n\n108 W. Main St., Newark; (302) 369-9414\n\nDespite the legend, Edgar Allen Poe never raised a glass here. But he did lecture at the nearby Newark Academy and, as the story goes, cursed the Deer Park after he fell in the mud outside of it. Poe's \"Raven\" is the DP's mascot.\n\nAn inn, built in 1747, once stood on the ground. The Deer Park was built in 1851 and was once a hotel, and later became a restaurant and popular watering hole for University of Delaware students and local residents.\n\nThe Ashby family acquired the Deer Park in 2001 and made major renovations. The scruffiness is gone, but the Ashbys kept \"the townie bar\" and other traditions such as the Sunday Bloody Mary bar and half-price nachos on Wednesdays.\n\nWhat to order? Nachos grande, burgers, New England clam chowder, fish and chips, eggs Benedict, Bloody Marys.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Klondike Kate's, another popular UD haunt at 158 E. Main St. in Newark, offers American fare and a colorful history tracing back 281 years.\n\n59 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3674\n\nBeach eats come and go like the tide, but the Back Pork Cafe has endured for 45 seasons. This funky place, with a Key West vibe, started out as the Hotel Marvel and expanded over the years.\n\nRegulars like its laid-back elegance, three decks, regular live music and terrific cocktails. The food is upscale and the service attentive. Locals and tourists both are catered to, and it's not unusual to see a well-behaved dog by its owner's feet on one of the decks. The seasonal eatery closes in October and usually reopens by April.\n\nWhat to order? Dark and stormy cocktails, anything with wild mushrooms, grilled octopus, rabbit bolognese, coffee drinks flamed tableside.\n\nWhat's similar to it? It's probably not surprising to hear some of the Back Porch's original owners in 1981 opened the Blue Moon. The stylish, theatrical 35 Baltimore Ave. eatery is located in a 1907 Sears Craftsman house.\n\n2 Jay Drive, off Basin Road, New Castle; (302) 328-9740\n\nFew places look like the Dairy Palace anymore. It is truly like stepping back in time at this very popular, old-fashioned New Castle ice cream shack. Leave your cellphone in your pocket and soak in the \"American Graffiti\" vibe.\n\nThe seasonal business has been in operation since it was founded in 1956 by Vince and Joyce Parker.\n\nThe couple's daughter and her family are continuing the cash-only, walk-up stand that offers soft serve ice cream with curls that Beyonce would envy. Don't want ice cream (and, uh, why not?) you can also order sloppy Joes, hot dogs and chili dogs.\n\nOn a warm summer night, when the neon lights blink on spelling out \"Dairy Palace,\" it almost feels like you could run into Sandy, Danny, Kenickie and the rest of the \"Grease\" gang.\n\nWhat to order? Pretty much anything, but our preference is a chocolate, vanilla or twist soft serve cone with sprinkles.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Since 1972, three generations of the King family have run King’s Homemade Ice Cream Shops. The flagship Milton is in the oldest commercial building, circa 1830, in Sussex County. The Lewes location has served scoops since 1981.\n\n120 Four Seasons Parkway (off Del. 896), Glasgow; (302) 738-9935\n\nFamily photos decorate the walls of the restaurant that has an atmosphere as Italian as the Trevi Fountain.\n\nFrank Sinatra croons from the speakers and the aromatic smell of tomato sauce and freshly made pasta drifting through the four dining rooms can make the stomach rumble.\n\nLa Casa Pasta was founded in 1978 by Giuseppe Martuscelli who emigrated from Santa Maria di Castellabate, near Salerno, Italy. The family also owns Klondike Kate's in Newark and the Chesapeake Inn in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\n\nWhat to order? Arancini, mussels in spicy marinara sauce, vitello Giuseppe, lobster fra diavolo, bronzino, tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Vincente's Restaurant has moved a few times during its 47 year history. At its 5914 Kirkwood Highway home, chef/co-owner Dan Mancari presents showstopping, tableside Caesar salads and Bananas Foster.\n\n2038 Foulk Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-1887\n\nIt's hard to believe the building, dating back to the 1920s, has been known as anything but Stanley's Tavern. Still, when the state's best-known sports bar first opened in 1935, it was called Bill's Place.\n\nFormer Browntown resident Stanley Minakowski took over in 1947 and Stanley's Tavern was born. And 71 years later, it's still going strong.\n\nManaging partner Steve Torpey has been in the house since 1982. Stanley's has long been a favored spot to watch football (Philadelphia Eagles are the house team) or pretty much any televised athletic event. Walls are lined with sports-celebrity photos. Bartenders are friendly and chatty, and the beer is ice cold.\n\nThe restaurant has wide-ranging offerings and a popular salad bar.\n\nWhat to order? Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, meatloaf, baby back ribs, cheese fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Wilmington's Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon has been going strong since 1983. The 1801 W. 14th St. site, owned by Xavier Teixido, has continuously operated as a Wilmington restaurant since 1940.\n\n283 Front St., Leipsic; (302) 674-9724\n\nSambo's Tavern, founded by Samuel “Sambo” Burrows in 1953, sits alongside the 17-mile (or so) Leipsic River in Kent County where farms, marshlands and tidal streams converge.\n\nYou have to be at least 21 years old to enter. The establishment, run by Isaac and Elva Burrows, has a tavern license, not a restaurant license. It's also cash only, though there's an ATM machine on site.\n\nYou can call ahead and reserve a table. Try to get a window seat so you can watch watermen pull up and unload crab catches.\n\nOn summer weekends, the bar is full, pitchers of cold beer are flowing and crowds at newspaper-covered tables pick their way through batches of hot, steaming blue crabs. Visitors can go to a giant map that hangs on a wall and stick a pin on their hometown.\n\nWhat to order? Crabs, crabs, crabs. Oh, and the crab cake sandwich, French fries and potato salad.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Blue crab lovers also have been coming to Lestardo's, a relaxed crab house at Del. 273 and Prangs Lane in New Castle's Rambleton Acres Shopping Center since 1969.\n\n1406 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Fenwick Island; (302) 539-7156\n\nBreakfast has been a tradition at Warren's Station since 1960, but if you want a Bloody Mary or mimosa, head somewhere else. The beach eatery doesn't serve alcohol. It's been that way since it was founded by turkey farmer Warren D. Johnson who then called the business Warren's Family Restaurant.\n\nJeff and Paula Mumford bought the restaurant in 1971 and have since slightly changed the name. They also remodeled and enlarged the site to resemble a replica of a United States Lifesaving Station. Other Mumford family members now work in the business that's still affable and affordable.\n\nWhat to order? Chocolate chip pancakes, Fenwick Island Beach Patrol Sandwich, roast turkey, crab imperial, Delmarvelous rotisserie chicken, any housemade pie.\n\nWhat's similar to it?The equally family-friendly Robin Hood Restaurant at 54 Rehoboth Ave. in Rehoboth has been operating in the beach town since 1968.\n\n5812 Kennett Pike, Centreville; (302) 656-9776\n\nBuckley’s Tavern is to Centreville what the Deer Park Tavern is to Newark.\n\nWhile its home is an upper-crust, affluent area, the egalitarian eatery holds a place in the hearts of Delawareans partly because its crowd has ranged from construction workers in jeans to bankers in suits. It’s been a place of character for characters.\n\nThe building, dating back to 1817, started as a private residence and became a taproom and ice store in the 1930s. Dennis Buckley ran it from 1951 until 1970. It closed for 10 months in 2012 while the restaurant's longtime owners Bob Bolling and Bob Applegate brought in new operators and renovated the historic building.\n\nThe new look keeps the spirit of the original Buckley's while maintaining the integrity of the space.\n\nWhat to order? Roasted garlic hummus, Thai noodle soup, crab Cobb salad, Buckley's burger, French dip, macaroni and cheese. Go for the Sunday pajama brunch where half-price discounts are offered to those wearing PJs.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Feby's Fishery, operating since 1974, moved from Elsmere to its Lancaster Pike location in 1984. Snapper soup is a signature offering and devoted followers like that owners Philip and MarySue DiFebo remain wedded to tradition.\n\nBy limiting the list to 20 we're sure we've neglected some eateries.

But one of the biggest factors is cost.\n\nTurkeys are cheaper this year compared with last November, but data shows overall food costs are still high, especially when it comes to popular holiday side dishes.\n\n\"While inflation is not as extreme as last year, it is still present and grocery store prices have still been somewhat variable,\" Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nBut before you go thinking that this Thanksgiving may be a good year to dine out, experts also warn that restaurant menu prices have risen even more drastically.\n\nHere are some things to consider when choosing to cook at home or go out this Thanksgiving.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nWhy is Thanksgiving so expensive?As turkey prices drop, cost of some Thanksgiving side dishes go up\n\nTurkey prices are down from last Thanksgiving\n\nRetail prices for turkeys, the holiday's main course for many Americans, have been on the decline after costs for the birds soared in 2022 amid rising inflation and a rapidly spreading avian influenza that limited production. What's more, economists predict that prices could fall even further as Thanksgiving approaches and businesses try to lure customers with special deals.\n\nPer-pound prices for turkey rose more than 20% in 2022 over the previous year, according to an annual Thanksgiving report from Wells Fargo.\n\nThe price increase was spurred in part by overall inflation, but experts say the main culprit was highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The outbreak that began in January 2022 infected 7 million turkeys and wiped out commercial livestock, depleting supplies for last year's Thanksgiving, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nOverall, average turkey prices reached as high as $1.72 a pound just as Thanksgiving approached, Nelson said. As a result, a Farm Bureau survey in 2022 found that a Thanksgiving feast for 10 cost $64.05, a 20% increase from the previous year’s average of $53.31.\n\nShare your shopping plans:How are you feeling about this holiday shopping season?\n\nTurkey production is up just in time for the holiday\n\nAs the avian flu has begun to wane this year, farmers have once again been able to ramp up production. And fortunately for shoppers, that means that turkeys will be ample, with prices falling just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nTurkey production reached 432.3 million pounds in July − the month turkeys need to be placed on feed so they can be ready for Thanksgiving. That's a 9.7% increase over the previous year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture's September 2023 Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook.\n\nThe average retail cost of a frozen turkey hen at the end of last week was $1.35 a pound, about 8% lower than at the same time last year, according to a USDA report.\n\nBut prices could be even less closer to Nov. 23.\n\nSupermarkets are stocked with plenty of turkeys after last year's supply disruption, which means as Thanksgiving Day approaches, grocers often begin to offer promotions and discounts for the holiday staple. That includes selling turkeys at a cost lower than the wholesale price.\n\n\"Everyone who wants a turkey will be able to get one,\" a spokesperson for USDA told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPumpkin pie or apple?A state-by-state guide to people's favorite Thanksgiving pies\n\nPrices for ingredients in classic side dishes are still up\n\nTurkeys may be available for a bargain this year, but don't expect any deals on your favorite sides. This year's Wells Fargo report found that the cost of ingredients in classic Thanksgiving side dishes have risen in the last year.\n\nThe cost of russet potatoes is at an all-time high ($1.17 a pound), with costs rising 14% from a year ago.\n\nSweet potatoes increased in price by 4% within the last year.\n\nCanned green beans are up almost 9%.\n\nCanned cranberries increased 60% and canned cranberry sauce is up 7% (though fresh cranberries will cost 20% less.)\n\nAlso rising in price are canned pumpkins, which are up 30%.\n\nAnd who can forget booze? Beer and wine are more expensive this year (up 5.3% and 1.2%, respectively).\n\nWhich grocery stores are open?What to know about Kroger, Publix, Aldi, more for Thanksgiving\n\nWhich restaurants are open?See Starbucks, McDonald's, Cracker Barrel hours for Thanksgiving\n\nDining out is more expensive this year compared with last year\n\nDespite those rising costs, the fact that Thanksgiving's main course is more affordable means that 2023 may be the year to cook at home. That's opposite of 2022, when many economists said consumers may actually have saved money by going to a restaurant.\n\nThe cost of food away from home has increased at a faster rate (about 6%) than food at home from a standard grocery trip (2.4%), Michael Swanson, agriculture economist with Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, told USA TODAY.\n\nMeanwhile, the higher wages restaurants have had to offer to get employees to return to work after the pandemic have led to increased menu prices for diners, Swanson said.\n\n\"That pampering or that convenience has gone up faster than your cost for doing it at home,\" Swanson said in a phone interview. \"It's a foot race and this year, restaurants ran a lot faster than the supermarkets.”\n\nYet because prices for common Thanksgiving side dishes increased in the last year, Swanson said consumers shouldn't expect tremendous savings if making homemade feasts.\n\n“It’s really hard to say to people, 'Hey it’s going to be cheaper to eat for Thanksgiving this year as compared to last year,” Swanson said. “The (cost of) turkey is a nice offset, but in general food is not cheaper than a year ago.”\n\nThe verdict: With turkey prices down and grocery stores pushing deals, 2023 may be the year to cook at home. But overall, food prices are still high, so those wanting to avoid the messy kitchen may opt to head out for their meal.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

There was the Grinch (several of 'em actually), and an appearance from the big man himself, Santa Claus, who was accompanied by Mrs. Claus.\n\nUnlike the tragedy that was last year, when a red SUV driven by Darrell Brooks Jr. killed six people and injured dozens of others. Brooks faced 76 charges, including six for first-degree intentional homicide, and was found guilty of all of them at the end of October.\n\nBut an attack that devastating didn't stop groups — even the ones most severely impacted — from again taking part in this long-standing Waukesha tradition.\n\n'Entire community is not afraid'\n\nThe Catholic Community of Waukesha, candles in hand, and the Waukesha Blazers Baseball Club marched on. Both groups had multiple members among the injured, including baseball player Jackson Sparks, 8, who later died.\n\nThe beloved Milwaukee Dancing Grannies — who lost three dancers and the husband of a fourth — performed. So did the Xtreme Dance Team, whose members were among the most seriously injured.\n\nMirjam Haubert, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year, recalled watching the 2021 parade unravel with her family. After the SUV plowed through and a young girl from the Xtreme Dance Team was laying in front of her, Haubert's motherly instincts took over.\n\n“She was seizing on the street, so I put her head in my lap,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert sat with the girl and, with the help of a few others, kept her warm with jackets. When a police officer offered to drive the girl to the hospital, Haubert went along.\n\nAt the hospital, the girl fell into a coma. Around Thanksgiving last year, she woke up, surviving her injuries.\n\n“I don't know what I would have done if she would have not made it,” Haubert said.\n\nHaubert’s teenage daughter, who also attended last year's parade, still dislikes large crowds and decided to not attend this year's. But Haubert felt she had to come and walk with her coworkers.\n\n“I have to force myself to go through this and show that we are not afraid and the entire community is not afraid,” she said.\n\n'GRANNY STRONG!': A year after deadly parade tragedy, 'Dancing Grannies' will march again\n\nOnce again, the Dancing Grannies demonstrated their resilience\n\nA banner with the names of the members they lost, along with large individual portraits of them, led the Dancing Grannies through Sunday's parade route. Those members were Virginia \"Ginny\" Sorenson, Tamara Durand, and Leanna Owen, and the husband of a fourth, William Hospel.\n\nTime and time again over the past year, the treasured troupe — a fixture at Wisconsin parades for nearly 40 years — has demonstrated its resilience.\n\nNearly two weeks after the attack, the group marched in the Franklin Christmas Parade. They walked arm-in-arm, waving at the cheering crowds along the parade route. The names of the members who died were emblazoned on the back of their matching blue sweatshirts.\n\nTheir first performance back was in March for Milwaukee's St. Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nFor a while, member Betty Streng wasn't sure she'd be well enough to perform for St. Patrick's Day. She suffered a skull fracture and brain bleed in the attack and required emergency surgery. She has since fully recovered.\n\nIn November, Streng and her gals gave a special performance at St. Luke's in Milwaukee to honor the medical professionals who saved her life. To honor their fallen, members of the group have been wearing a No. 4 on their matching hats, including the white, fluffy ones they donned Sunday.\n\nWAUKESHA PARADE HEARING: 'I saw pure unrepentant evil': Waukesha parade attack victims share lasting pain at sentencing hearing\n\nA look at this year's parade\n\nNikki Petrie, who walked with Waukesha State Bank this year and last, said that seeing the chairs set up for the parade took her back to what she witnessed in 2021.\n\n“I remember walking back home and seeing all of the blankets, chairs, wagons — everyone just leaving everything behind,” Petrie said. Her decision to walk was made to honor those whose lives were lost.\n\n“I feel like I do, you know, owe it to the lives that were lost,” Petrie said. “I was lucky enough to walk away.”\n\nThe parade — themed \"Peace on Earth\" — began by remembering those who died in last year's tragedy and honoring first responders. A banner read: \"In remembrance of the 2021 parade victims, survivors, families and first responders.\" It was followed by a blue and white memorial float with snowflakes and the words \"In remembrance\" and \"Peace to all.\"\n\nNear the front of the parade, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson shook hands with parade watchers as Mayor Shawn Reilly waved to participants. The ReMax float, which again featured hot-air balloon flame-makers atop the bed of a pickup truck, was a welcome presence. “I wish they’d stop right here,” said one woman standing on the sidewalk as the warmth of the flames penetrated the crowd.\n\nAs the skies darkened, the parade route brightened with lights from the floats and watchers adorned with lights on the curbs. Parade-goer Kimberly Quartullo wore blue Christmas lights around her neck. Blue lights have become a symbol of strength and unity in the community.\n\nShe set up in front of Mama Ducky’s, just as she has for the past 15 years. Last year, that's where she witnessed members of the Xtreme Dance Team land in front of her. What played out before her was like “a silent movie,” she said.\n\n“Because I am deaf, I did not hear much except for a big boom,” Quartullo said. Her hearing aid helped her hear the SUV’s impact and the screams of the crowd.\n\nShe's attended every Waukesha parade since.\n\n“I came back to this one because, why not keep the community strong?” Quartullo said.\n\nMORE: Darrell Brooks sentenced to life in prison in Wisconsin Christmas parade attack that left 6 dead\n\nChanges to the parade\n\nThe first parade Waukesha held following the tragedy was for Memorial Day.\n\nFor the parade, the city debuted new MVB3X barriers, portable devices capable of disabling vehicles as large as semitrailers from sudden and unauthorized access to key points along the parade route. Public safety vehicles were also used as guards for access points necessary for parade vehicles.\n\nPolice now routinely create a perimeter that is cleared of vehicles ahead of any event. The parade also had a new route.\n\nThis year's Christmas parade was held two weeks later than it had been for nearly 60 years. That way, police and other critical staff were not fighting holiday schedules that could have made an emergency response more difficult.\n\nReflecting on the past, moving forward\n\nLast year, Znidorka, a mentor for Lad Lake, a Wisconsin youth residential care center, brought a 12-year-old boy he mentors to enjoy the parade and help him feel more comfortable in crowds.\n\n“At first, it was really fun,” Znidorka said. “It was a joyous day.”\n\nWhen the SUV came barreling through, he was in shock at first and unable to comprehend what had just happened.\n\n“Right away, the boy I was with, ran to the doors (of Burlap and Lace) and said, ‘Jerry, get in here,’” Znidorka said. “And then we were locked down in the store for 45 minutes to an hour.”\n\nThis year, Znidorka again stood in front of Burlap and Lace. This time, he was by himself. “As you can see, the boy is not with me this year,” he said. “He wanted to hold back this year.”\n\nOver the past year, Znidorka confided in mental health professionals that have helped him prepare for facing the scene of the tragedy again.\n\n“I wanted to not just get past it, but I also want to realize that sort of thing shouldn't stop us,” Znidorka said.\n\nWaukesha Girl Scouts leader Bonnie Stojadinovic had been helping out at United Church of Christ when the troupe was marching in the 2021 parade. After the attack, police sought her help, given her background as a health care provider in the ICU of Children’s Wisconsin.\n\n“They asked me to help triage patients at the scene,” Stojadinovic recalled. “After it was all said and done, I came back, but we were in lockdown in our church. So I received a police escort so that I could go home and change and go into work at the ICU to help care for the kids who were being triaged from the scene that I had taken care of here.”\n\nThis year, she set up a table outside United Church of Christ with one purpose: to call attention to canine officers who were “unsung heroes” in last year’s parade attack.\n\n“(The Girl Scouts) recognized there were so many people who were praising the nurses, paramedics, firefighters and police officers, but nobody mentioned the canine heroes who were at the parade the day of (the attack) and in the days that followed, supporting the community and supporting the kids who had been traumatized,” Stojadinovic said. “So they decided their Silver Award was going to be dedicated to these unsung heroes.”\n\nContributing: Sarah Volpenhein and Sophie Carson, Journal Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2016/11/25/make-plans-for-holiday-fun/94245928/", "title": "Make holiday plans with parades, music, lights", "text": "Donna Isbell Walker, diwalker@greenvillenews.com\n\nNow that Thanksgiving is upon us, the holiday season is sure to fly by faster than Santa’s reindeer.

For the NFL on Thanksgiving, we'll have to fast forward a little bit.\n\nThe NFL was born in the 1920s, but a famous tradition wasn't born until the league's teenage years. Here's everything you need to know about the NFL's Thanksgiving traditions, who has the most wins and how each team has fared on the holiday.\n\nWhen was the first NFL Thanksgiving game?\n\nPicture it: Detroit 1934. Bing Crosby is at the top of music world, the Great Depression is ravaging the country, Franklin D. Roosevelt is President and Babe Ruth is in the midst of his final season as a New York Yankee.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nMeanwhile in the Motor City, the Lions are looking to gain some traction in a town dominated by baseball's Tigers. Enter George A. Richards, who bought the Portsmouth Spartans and moved them to Detroit in 1934. The team would then become known as the Lions, but needed something to get the fans' attention.\n\nSo Richards went and scheduled a game on Thanksgiving against the defending champion Chicago Bears. Just like that, a tradition was born.\n\nThe Lions would play the Bears in the first ever Thanksgiving Day NFL game in 1934. The site would be the University of Detroit Stadium with 26,000 people in attendance, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It's believed that more people would've attended if the stadium capacity was larger.\n\nDetroit won the first Turkey Day contest by a score of 19-10, beginning a tradition that has withstood the test of time. While fads like the \"Harlem Shake\" and \"Tebowing\" came and went, the Lions have managed to weave themselves into Thanksgiving just as much as your mother's stuffing recipe.\n\nThe team's fans don't often feel in the holiday spirit on the holiday, however. In fact, the Lions experience on Thanksgiving typically resembles the feeling you get when the annoying family member arrives.\n\nWhile they've gotten better in recent years, Detroit still has some work to do to get above .500 on Turkey Day.\n\nWhat NFL teams always play on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are the two mainstays on Thanksgiving, with Detroit playing their first game in 1934 and Dallas joining the tradition in 1966. Both teams have been permanent fixtures ever since, with four other teams being selected each year to round out the holiday schedule.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played 84 Thanksgiving games, the most of any team. They are 37-45-2 in those games. Considering they won't be relinquishing control of the NFL's tradition anytime soon, it's safe to say that they will continue to be Turkey Day's most featured team.\n\nWhich team has the most wins on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Lions have won 37 games on Thanksgiving, giving them the most on the NFL's biggest holiday. It's fitting considering they've played 84 games on the day, but it hasn't translated to a ton of success in the franchise's history. Detroit also has 45 losses on Thanksgiving, but recent history suggests that Dan Campbell's team will be improving that record in the coming years.\n\nNFL Thanksgiving records by team", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/11/28/what-nfl-team-played-most-thanksgiving-games/76622080007/", "title": "What NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving games?", "text": "Thanksgiving should be a restful day. Unfortunately for some NFL players, it's anything but.\n\nThe NFL on Thanksgiving is a tradition that dates back to the 1930s, when the Detroit Lions hosted the first Thanksgiving football game against the Chicago Bears. Since then, the Lions have been champions of Thanksgiving – well, at least in appearances.\n\nThe Lions have remained a staple of Turkey Day pigskin for all to see since their first game, though their record shows they still have some work to do to earn a turkey leg. Later joined by the Dallas Cowboys, the Cowboys and Lions are as much engrained into the festivities of Turkey Day as much as cranberry sauce, naps and political arguments at the dinner table.\n\nHere's what to know about Thanksgiving Day records, appearances and more.\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving Day games?\n\nThe Lions have played 84 Thanksgiving games, the most of any team.

Here's their record by team:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/11/22/lions-cowboys-thanksgiving-football-history-records-ratings/71660938007/", "title": "Lions or Cowboys: Who has the more storied Thanksgiving history?", "text": "Thanksgiving Day is all about football. What? You thought it was about family, sharing, and being thankful for the life you have? Incorrect. The truth of the matter is that football was the only reason those pilgrims and Native Americans shared that feast. They knew that nothing was more important than letting their ancestors watch Derrick Henry stiff arm Earl Thomas into oblivion.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions have kept that tradition alive by offering to play on Thanksgiving every year until the end of time. The tradition started in 1934 when the Lions played the world champion Chicago Bears in an instant classic that ended with the Bears winning 19-16. Since 1945, the Lions have not missed a single holiday (no Thanksgiving games were played from 1941-1944).\n\nThe Cowboys joined the Lions later, in 1966. They have since missed two Thanksgivings, in 1975 and 1977. While the Lions may have started this tradition, their consistently disappointing performances and failure to win a Super Bowl has forced many fans to lean in favor of the Cowboys every Turkey Day. So, who actually owns Thanksgiving? The Detroit Lions or the Dallas Cowboys?\n\nBeast mode:NFL Pick 6 record: Cowboys' DaRon Bland ties mark, nears NFL history\n\nRecords on Thanksgiving\n\nWhile the Lions have played the most Thanksgiving Day games of any NFL team (89), they haven't been immune to controversy in that time. Most notably, many NFL fans wanted the Lions removed from Thanksgiving primetime in 2008. The Lions were 0-11 at the time, and were trounced by the Tennessee Titans that year 47-10. Obviously, the NFL decided to let Detroit keep their Turkey Day tradition.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Lions have a record of 37-44-2 on Thanksgiving. Since 2000 though, the Lions are an abysmal 6-17 on Thanksgiving. Currently, the Lions have lost six straight, most recently a 28-25 loss to the Buffalo Bills in 2022.\n\nThe Cowboys on the other hand, have a record of 32-22-1 on Thanksgiving. While they have lost three of their last four Thanksgiving Day contests, they've proven much more capable of living up to the Turkey Day privilege than Detroit in recent years.\n\nDallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Record: 32-22-1\n\n32-22-1 Cowboys Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 2-3\n\n2-3 Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Record: 37-44-2\n\n37-44-2 Lions Record in Last 5 Thanksgivings: 0-5\n\nThat could change this season though. The Lions currently hold the second-best record in the NFL and their matchup is against the Green Bay Packers, a team they've already beaten this year. The Cowboys get a matchup against divisional adversary, the Washington Commanders. The Commanders dominated the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in 2020 to the tune of a 41-16 beatdown led by halfback Antonio Gibson. That said, things have changed since then. The Cowboys are much improved, while the Commanders just lost to the woeful New York Giants.\n\nWhich team gets more viewers:\n\nThanksgiving Day games are often some of the most-watched NFL games every season. Last year was no different. In fact, the 2022 game between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants set an NFL regular season viewership record with 42.1 million viewers tuning in, beating out the previous NFL record-holder, a 1990 matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants. It goes without saying that it was also the most viewed Thanksgiving Day game of all-time, beating out the Cowboys 2021 game against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nFor comparison, the 2022 Lions-Bills Thanksgiving Day game earned 31.78 million viewers. That's still a lot. In fact, it was the most-watched early Thanksgiving Day game of all-time.\n\nWith that in mind, there's an argument to be made that the Lions would have earned more viewers if they were given the afternoon or evening time slot. At the same time though, the NFL knows which games will garner the most viewers and tend to flex the best in the best time slots. If the Lions would draw more viewers, they likely would have been given the afternoon slot.\n\nWith all that said, it's pretty easy to tell which team gets more viewers. The Cowboys are \"America's Team\" after all, while the Lions had many fans begging the NFL to remove them from the Thanksgiving slot because of how bad they had been for most of the 2000's.\n\nThanksgiving Day Odds:\n\nThe Lions and Cowboys are favorites to defeat the Packers and Commanders, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

The Lions have already beaten the Packers handedly this season, 38-20. Now get to face them at home. The Packers will likely be without both star running back Aaron Jones and star cornerback Jaire Alexander as well.\n\nAs bad as the Lions have been on Thanksgiving, the Packers haven't been much better, boasting just a 14-20-2 record all-time. Give me the Lions (-7.5) all day.\n\nPrediction: Lions 29, Packers 16\n\nWashington Commanders @ Dallas Cowboys:\n\nThe Commanders are one of the toughest teams to predict in all of football. Their 4-7 record would have you thinking they're a middle-of-the-road, maybe even low-tier team. However, they were also very close to defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, forcing the reigning NFC champs to overtime in Week 4. Washington always seems to play to their level of competition, and while that doesn't mean they will beat the Cowboys, they will probably keep it close.\n\nThe Commanders are a dreadful 4-8 all-time on Thanksgiving. That's the second-worst record of any team with at least ten Thanksgiving Day games played. Only the Arizona Cardinals (6-15-2) are worse. That said, I like the Commanders to keep this one a one-possession game. Divisional games are always tougher than the rest because each team knows the other so well.\n\nPrediction: Cowboys 31, Commanders 24\n\nNFL Week 12 schedule:What to know about betting odds, early lines, byes\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

The Lions have played on Thanksgiving every year for nearly eight decades and will be looking to snap a seven-game losing streak on the holiday.\n\nThe Lions have been winless on Thanksgiving since 2016 and have yet to capture the holiday win under the Brad Holmes/Dan Campbell regime. Last year, the Lions fell to the Green Bay Packers 29-22 after fumbling three times and having four failed fourth-down tries in the attempted comeback.\n\nBut this year, the odds are in Detroit's favor to snap that streak. The Lions are in first place in the NFL at 10-1 after cruising through a tough middle stretch of the schedule unbeaten. They are welcoming the Chicago Bears, a division rival down on their luck as the losers of five in a row.\n\nIt will be the 20th time the Lions and Bears have played on Thanksgiving, with Chicago holding an 11-8 advantage in the holiday matchups. The Bears have a three-game winning streak (2018, 2019, 2021) with Detroit's last win over Chicago on Thanksgiving coming in 2014.\n\nAll things Lions: Latest Detroit Lions news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nTo get you ready for Thursday's action, here is a look back at the full history of the Lions playing on Thanksgiving.\n\nLions Thanksgiving history\n\nLions football has been a Thanksgiving Day tradition ever since the team moved to the Motor City in 1934.\n\nTHE OTHER '34 CONNECTION:Lions have won 8 straight games for first time since 1934 — their first year in Detroit\n\nThe Lions have played 84 total times on Turkey Day and the tradition has happened every year since 1945. Then-team owner G.A. Richards started the tradition to try to gain traction with Detroit's fanbase in the team's first season in the city. The next closest team is the Dallas Cowboys, who play annually in the mid-afternoon time slot after Detroit, with 56 Thanksgiving games.\n\nThe Lions lost the first-ever Thanksgiving game to the Chicago Bears, 16-13, in front of a sold-out, 26,000-person crowd at the University of Detroit Stadium, located on 6 Mile. It was the first nationally broadcast Thanksgiving game, carried by over 90 radio stations. The Lions played the Bears in the first five Thanksgiving matchups until 1938 before pausing play on the holiday until 1945. The next game against the Bears took place in 1947.\n\nAll-time Thanksgiving record\n\nSince the tradition started, the Lions have an all-time 37-45-2 record on Thanksgiving Day games. The Lions were above .500 for most of the 20th century before falling off thanks to two hefty losing streaks. The Lions are 6-18 on Thanksgiving this century, dragged down by a nine-game skid in 2004-12 and an active seven-game losing streak dating back to 2016.\n\nThat 2016 win came against the Minnesota Vikings when Jim Caldwell was the head coach and Matthew Stafford was under center. The Lions won, 16-13, as Stafford began the game with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin. Matt Prater added three field goals and the defense held former No. 1 overall pick Sam Bradford and the Minnesota offense in check all afternoon.\n\nThanksgiving winning and losing streaks\n\nThat nine-game losing streak from 2004-12 was the worst Turkey Day run in franchise history. It spanned four head coaches — Steve Mariucci, Dick Jauron (as interim), Rod Marinelli and Jim Schwartz — before it finally came to an end with a 40-10 win over the Packers in 2013 in Schwartz's final season. The worst loss during the streak was a 47-10 thumping by the Tennessee Titans during the winless 2008 season.\n\nThe best stretch of Thanksgiving performances came in the first half of the 1950s when the Lions were one of the best teams in the NFL. The Lions won six straight on Thanksgiving from 1950-55, including five straight over the Packers. Hall of Fame quarterback Bobby Layne, who was part of three NFL-champion Lions squads, was under center for the streak. The biggest win was 34-15 win over Green Bay in 1953, a year the Lions won it all.\n\nMemorable Thanksgiving moments in Detroit\n\nLawrence Taylor's winning pick-six: The 1982 Thanksgiving battle between the New York Giants and the Lions was a defensive battle defined by a memorable highlight for one of the best defensive players of all-time. With the score tied 6-6 in the fourth quarter, Lawrence Taylor dropped into coverage on the goal line and jumped in front of a Gary Danielson pass to the flat. Taylor returned the interception 97 yards for a pick-six, the only touchdown of the game, to give New York a 13-6 win.\n\nThe Jerome Bettis coin flip fiasco: Detroit native Jerome Bettis is responsible for the most infamous moment of the Lions’ Thanksgiving tradition. Bettis’ Steelers tied the 1998 game on a Norm Johnson field goal with 4 seconds left in regulation. When the Hall of Fame running back went to midfield to call the overtime coin toss, he appeared to call tails, but referee Phil Luckett heard heads. The coin flip landed on tails, and the Lions got the ball to start overtime and went on to win on a Jason Hanson field goal, 19-16.\n\nJim Schwartz vs. the red challenge flag: The Lions' miserable nine-game skid can be best defined by the 34-31 overtime loss to the Houston Texans in 2012. Justin Forsett scored on an 81-yard run in the third quarter, though the touchdown never should have counted. Forsett’s elbow and knee hit the ground short of a first down, but Lions coach Jim Schwartz threw a challenge flag on the play. Unfortunately, because the play was set to be reviewed automatically, Schwartz's challenge drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty AND wiped out the official booth review that would have called back the score. The Texans completed their comeback after Hanson missed a field goal in overtime.\n\nNdamukong Suh's stomp: Another defining moment in the Lions' losing streak happened in the 2011 loss to the Packers. Suh cemented his reputation as one of the NFL’s dirtiest players on Nov. 24, 2011, when he was ejected from the 27-15 loss after he stomped on the right arm of Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Suh was suspended two games for the first-quarter incident.\n\nBarry Sanders' national show: Barry Sanders had a lot of memorable performances during his 2,053-yard 1997 season, but his dazzling Thanksgiving game against the Bears ranks near the top. He ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Lions to a 55-20 win. Sanders scored on runs of 40, 25 and 15 yards as the Lions scored 45 straight points to rally from a two-possession deficit.\n\nJared Ramsey is a sports reporter for the Detroit Free Press.

A quick three-and-out by the Giants gave the Cowboys the ball back again and Dowdle scored from four yards out to push Dallas' lead to 27-10.\n\nThe Giants scored twice in the fourth quarter, a Graham Gano field goal and that Lock touchdown run, to make it 27-20 before Dallas ran out the clock.

Then-Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm volunteered the Cowboys to play on the second game, so long as the team could host the game each year.\n\nThe Cowboys won their Thanksgiving debut 26-14 over the Cleveland Browns and the tradition continued the following season. The St. Louis (now Arizona) Cardinals took over as a host team for the Cowboys in 1975 and 1977 but Dallas was reinstated in 1978 and have had a permanent place on the holiday ever since.\n\nDallas has played 56 total games on Thanksgiving with a 33-22-1 record on the holiday entering 2024.\n\n-Ayrton Ostly\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are continuing their long-time tradition of playing on Thanksgiving Day. For their 2024 game against the New York Giants, they will have to do so without their starting quarterback.\n\nDak Prescott will not be available to play on Thanksgiving. He is missing a fourth consecutive contest after he suffered a hamstring against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 9.\n\nInstead, backup Cooper Rush will make a fourth consecutive start and look to earn back-to-back wins as Dallas looks to improbably claw its way back into the playoff race.\n\nPrescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled.\n\n-Jacob Camenker\n\nThe Lions played the Bears in the first-ever Thanksgiving Day NFL game in 1934. The site was the University of Detroit Stadium with 26,000 people in attendance, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It's believed that more people would've attended if the stadium capacity was larger.\n\nGeorge A. Richards, who bought the Portsmouth Spartans and moved them to Detroit in 1934, was looking to gain some traction in a town dominated by baseball's Tigers. The team then become known as the Lions but needed something to get the fans' attention.\n\nSo Richards went and scheduled a game on Thanksgiving against the defending champion Chicago Bears. Just like that, a tradition was born.\n\n-Joseph Rivera, Nick Brinkerhoff\n\nDeVito was a surprise add to the Giants' injury report on Tuesday, turning in a limited session. The quarterback is dealing with a forearm injury to his throwing arm, according to head coach Brian Daboll.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN's Jordan Raanan reported that DeVito was not traveling with the team to Dallas, and that the Week 12 starter was \"a longshot\" to play against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. DeVito is currently listed as \"questionable\" for Thursday.\n\n-Nick Brinkerhoff, Jack McKessy\n\nIn recent years, Luke Combs and Dolly Parton graced the stage to commemorate the \"Salvation Army Red Kettle Kickoff Halftime Show.\" This time, Dallas is set to welcome in another one of country music's biggest stars on Thanksgiving: Lainey Wilson.\n\nThe team announced the decision in October, naming the 32-year-old Louisiana native as this year's entertainer. In her signature bell-bottoms, Wilson appeared alongside the famous Cowboys' cheerleaders and teased a special guest would join her during the show.\n\n\"I am so excited to announce that I have teamed up with The Salvation Army to love beyond the holidays and make a difference in our communities all year round,\" she said in the video.\n\n-Nick Brinkerhoff\n\nHave any NFL teams never played on Thanksgiving?\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are the only active franchise to have never played on Thanksgiving. Three teams have had one game on the holiday: the Carolina Panthers (2015), Cincinnati Bengals (2010), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2006).\n\n-Ayrton Ostly\n\nDallas Cowboys inactives\n\nRB Deuce Vaughn\n\nG Zack Martin\n\nTE Jake Ferguson\n\nDE Marshawn Kneeland\n\nWR Ryan Flournoy\n\nCB Trevon Diggs\n\nCB Andrew Booth\n\nNew York Giants inactives\n\nQB Tommy DeVito (emergency 3rd QB)\n\nTE Greg Dulcich\n\nCB Deonte Banks\n\nS Anthony Johnson\n\nCB Tre Hawkins III\n\nG Jake Kubas\n\nT Jermaine Eluemunor\n\nWhat NFL team has played the most Thanksgiving games?\n\nThe Lions have played 84 Thanksgiving games, the most of any team.

CNN spoke with experts to find out.\n\nFootball started out as an amateur sport – played mainly in elite northeastern colleges like Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia, said Matthew Andrews, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe Thanksgiving tradition began back in 1876, when the Intercollegiate Football Association began hosting their championship game on the holiday. But the tradition didn’t begin to pick up steam until 1880, Andrews said, when the association moved the end-of-season game to New York.\n\nIt’s this game, Andrews said, that took football from a sporting event to a social one.\n\n“This game was sort of the unofficial start of the winter holiday social season,” he said. “People from the different colleges and universities would flood New York City, and there would be pregame Wednesday night dinners and Friday and Saturday night there would be post-game balls and trips to the theater. And that’s when it really takes off, in the 1880s and the 1890s.”\n\nAnd so, by the mid-1890s, college football and Thanksgiving day were synonymous.\n\nNot everyone approved of the new tradition\n\nThanksgiving didn’t really become an annually celebrated holiday until 1863, when Abraham Lincoln encouraged its recognition as a way to promote unionism during the Civil War, Andrews said. The rise of Thanksgiving, then, is almost congruent with the rise of football: the holiday helped fuel the popularity of the sport, Andrews said, and in turn football made Thanksgiving a little more secular and more widely appealing.\n\nA wood engraving from \"Once a Week\" magazine shows the onfield action during a football match between Yale and Princeton, in the late 19th century. Stock Montage/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAnd their alliance makes sense, Andrews said. Professional football didn’t exist yet, so the sport was intrinsically tied to communities at the high school and college level, which can foster fierce loyalties. School colors are often linked to football teams, and landmark events like homecoming are typically tied to a football game.\n\n“Football is the sport around which communities revolve,” Andrew said. “This holiday in which we’re celebrating community, I think it makes sense that football would seamlessly fit into that culture.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean everyone celebrated the shift.\n\nIn 1893, the New York Herald condemned the rise of football on Thanksgiving, arguing that the sport was ruining the holiday.\n\n“Thanksgiving is no longer a solemn festival to God for mercies given,” the paper printed. “It is a holiday granted to the state and nation to see a game of football.”\n\nNFL teams began playing on Thanksgiving to increase their popularity\n\nAt that point, football was still an amateur sport. When the NFL was founded in 1920, no one was really interested in professional football, Andrews said.\n\nSo, the league started scheduling games on Thanksgiving – drawing on pre-existing traditions to help establish the league into American consciousness. In the first decade, the NFL would schedule as many as six games on Thanksgiving, a far cry from the three games they schedule now. It was all an attempt to bring interest and notability to the sport, Andrews said.\n\nA Detroit Lions football team photo from circa 1934. That year, the Lions began their annual Thanksgiving game tradition, which has continued to this day. Sports Studio Photos/Getty Images\n\n“Of course they played on Thanksgiving, because by 1920 Thanksgiving meant football and football meant Thanksgiving,” Andrews said. “The NFL would’ve been missing a critical opportunity to popularize the game if they had not played on Thanksgiving day. It almost would’ve been un-American.”\n\nAnd the strategy worked. The Detroit Lions, who play every year on Thanksgiving, first began that tradition in 1934 – done in an effort to increase their brand and put fans in the stands.\n\nStill, professional football hadn’t really exploded in popularity just yet. Baseball was still the most popular sport in the US. But by the 1960s, that had begun to shift, Andrews said.\n\nIt’s during that shift that the Dallas Cowboys, who also play every year on the holiday, started their Thanksgiving tradition. At the time, the Cowboys were a new team looking to build their brand and their fanbase. So in 1966, they began to host a Thanksgiving game, Andrews said, bringing instant exposure to the team.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Cowboys were the most famous football team in the US, and Thanksgiving and professional football were intrinsically linked. And still, per tradition, the Lions and the Cowboys continue to play every year on the holiday.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' Bob Hayes, pictured in action against the Washington Commanders in Dallas on December 11, 1996. James Drake/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nBut eventually, other teams complained, arguing that they didn’t “get a piece of that Thanksgiving pie,” Andrews said. As a result, in 2006, the NFL added a third Thanksgiving game to the lineup, featuring rotating teams.\n\nAnd these Thanksgiving games are important to fans. Last year, the Thanksgiving matchup between the Raiders and the Cowboys was the fourth most-watched telecast of 2021, behind the Super Bowl and the AFC and NFC Championships. Aside from the presidential inauguration, the top-10 most watched telecasts were all NFL games.\n\n“Right or wrong, football is a religion in this country,” Andrews said. “And so football on Thanksgiving is sacred.”", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/passaic/clifton/2019/11/27/clifton-passaic-nj-to-play-last-thanksgiving-day-football-game/4248807002/", "title": "Clifton, Passaic to play last Thanksgiving Day football game", "text": "UPDATE:Clifton football beats Passaic in final Thanksgiving Day meeting\n\nA century-long North Jersey football Thanksgiving Day tradition comes to an end on Thursday as Clifton and Passaic high schools play the last Turkey Bowl game.\n\nThe neighboring city teams have battled each other on the gridiron on Thanksgiving since 1992. Before that, and dating back 100 years for Passaic and a bit less for Clifton, the teams each faced a number of worthy opponents.\n\nPassaic's Indians took the field for the first time on Thanksgiving Day in 1915 against Rutherford.\n\nClifton's Mustangs played their first game in 1927 against Garfield.\n\nIt was the tradition to watch or play in the game, then walk home and enjoy the Thanksgiving feast.\n\nOn Thursday the two teams will come together at Clifton Stadium one last time. They haven't missed a battle against each other since 1992. The current players and officials said the end of the tradition is bittersweet.\n\nOn Tuesday, players from both teams gathered for the annual Sportsmanship Breakfast in Clifton. It's traditionally hosted by the home team to encourage good sportsmanship between the neighboring lower Passaic County cities.\n\n\"This is a big deal,\" Clifton Athletic Director Tom Mullahey told players. \"This is the end of an era. This is a piece of history.\"\n\nPassaic tackle Kevin Bovier said he hates to see the tradition come to an end. \"Not only does it mean something to us, but to our city as well.\"\n\n\"Nobody works that day,\" Bovier said. \"A lot of my family members come up that day.\"\n\nClifton players, who lost to Union last weekend in the sectional finals, were more reserved about the end of the tradition.\n\nStill, senior Clifton Mustangs Eddie Maldonado III, Bob Urban and Chris Boneparte said they look forward to taking part in the final Thanksgiving Day game.\n\n\"I've been playing with some of these guys since I was 6 years old,\" Maldonado said.\n\nFrom a coaching and an athletic director's perspective, scrapping the Thanksgiving games made the most sense.\n\nPassaic finished its season on Nov. 7. The players would have been able to move on to their winter sports teams if it weren't for this final game, said Clifton coach Ralph Cinque. Instead, they have practiced just to play against Clifton. That's an inordinate amount of time between games, especially because tryouts for track, basketball and wrestling started on Monday, he said.\n\n\"It's unfair to the kids,\" Cinque said.\n\nPassaic coach William Widener said his team ended the season 6-3. If the team had played Clifton earlier, he said, the power points earned would have pushed his team into the playoffs. Clifton was a top-ranked team this year, and just playing it would have earned Passaic extra points.\n\nAs for Clifton, this is the first time since 2006 that the team reached the sectional finals. Clifton won the championship in 2006.\n\nThe fans\n\nThose who attended and looked forward to the rivalry game between the cities will be the most unhappy.\n\nPassaic's Ron Smith has been to every one of the city team's Thanksgiving Day games since 1962. He said he is very disappointed to see such a longstanding tradition end.\n\n\"It is ridiculous,\" Smith said. \"It is ending because the state wants it to.\"\n\nSmith is referring to the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which regulates state high school athletics. The association has not stopped the teams from playing, but some officials feel the playoff schedule makes the holiday game impractical.\n\nIn North Jersey, there are still two Thanksgiving games played — Teaneck-Hackensack and Dumont-Tenafly. The Thanksgiving Day game between Paterson's Kennedy and Eastside high schools was switched to Thanksgiving eve as of last year.\n\nStill, it's a long way from 30 years ago, when Thanksgiving Day high school football was the norm. In the 1980s and 1990s, the football season started later in the school year, so Thanksgiving was still part of the season, rather than postseason. Seasons that once started in mid-September now have games in late August.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nClifton's Keith Oakley is also distressed about the end of the tradition.\n\n\"Everyone's disappointed by this,\" Oakley said.\n\nJust as family members gathered around the dinner table on Thanksgiving, the day was a great time to catch up with old mates, Oakley said.\n\nThe trend to do away with the holiday games has also been seen in Central and South Jersey, although it is not as prevalent as in North Jersey.\n\nClifton versus Passaic\n\nPassaic's Thanksgiving Day game predates the Macy's parade. In 1915, Passaic played Rutherford in its first Thanksgiving game. The Macy's parade marched in Manhattan for the first time in 1924, and three years later, Clifton played its first holiday game against Garfield.\n\nClifton and Passaic have matched up 90 times, with 32 played on Thanksgiving. Clifton won 48 games and Passaic 37. They tied five times.\n\nWhile Clifton holds a quantitative advantage, some argue that Passaic holds the qualitative one.\n\nPassaic boasted both legendary teams and players. The city has had 14 players who made it to the NFL, according to bergenpassaicfootball.com.\n\nSome remember watching the Indians play on Thanksgiving morning and NFL greats Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward and Jack Tatum later in the afternoon.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nCity Historian Mark Auerbach said Tatum, also known as \"the Assassin,\" was among the best ever to play in the NFL. He played for Passaic High School, then Ohio State, and was in the NFL from 1971-1980.\n\nPassaic Thanksgiving game fans witnessed some great football in 1981, '82 and '83, as the team won every game except two in 1982. They lost that year to Belleville and Montclair. They won three sectional championships, according to bergenpassaicfootball.com. During those championship years, Passaic was helped by RB Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward and LB Tyronne Stowe. They eventually went on to have long NFL careers.\n\nAuerbach said the 1936 Turkey Bowl game may have been the greatest ever: the year of the 45-yard drop kick by Augie Lio, which won the game 3-0.\n\nLio went on to play at Georgetown and then in the NFL for seven seasons. He eventually became the sports editor and columnist for the Herald News.\n\nClifton football produced 13-year NFL veteran David Szott as well as Bob Holly and Larry Mialik. Clifton won section titles from 1951 through 1953 and from 1957 through 1959, and took back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969 and in 1972 and 1973.\n\nThe last Thanksgiving Day game appears to be promising. A rising Passaic team faces Clifton, which was just eliminated from the playoffs. Both sides want to win.\n\nThe winning team is sure to make history as the last to win the Clifton-Passaic Turkey Bowl.\n\nBoneparte said if you are going to play, then play to win. \"Why not come away with a big W?\" he asked.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of years since Clifton had reached sectional finals. Clifton last won the championship in their section in 2006.\n\nMatt Fagan is a reporter for NorthJersey.com.

While the veteran quarterback dropped to 0-8 in games with a starting temperature at 45 degrees or lower, he posted a solid stat line, completing 37-of-46 passes for 364 yards and two touchdowns. He also avoided an interception for just the third time in his eight cold-weather games.\n\nWhat went wrong for the Dolphins? Their defense struggled early to contain the Packers, who racked up 14 points in the first quarter. Miami also lost the turnover battle, fumbling once before their first offensive drive and turning the ball over twice on downs. Those turnovers led to 13 Green Bay points, which turned out to be the difference in the game.\n\nThe Packers improved to 9-3 win the victory and will have a chance to cut into the Detroit Lions' NFC North lead when they meet on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 14.

The Packers are looking like a playoff shoo-in while the Dolphins will need to get hot again to make a playoff run.\n\nPackers 30, Dolphins 17: Tyreek Hill catches tip-drill touchdown\n\nThe Dolphins worked quickly to get in the end-zone. Tua Tagovailoa threw a pass over the middle of the field to Jonnu Smith but the veteran tight end couldn't hold onto it.\n\nHowever, the ball bounced right into the waiting arms of Tyreek Hill, who grabbed it to add a touchdown to his stat line. The Dolphins couldn't get the two-point conversion and still trail by 13 with 3:04 left in regulation.\n\nPackers 30, Dolphins 11: Green Bay settles for field goal after Elgton Jenkins penalty\n\nThe Packers nearly got into the end-zone after a Dontavyion Wicks caught a Jordan Love pass just short of the goal-line but couldn't extend the ball over the chalk. Elgton Jenkins was called for an unnecessary roughness penalty that turned a fourth-and-inches at the goal line into a fourth-and-15, so Green Bay kicked the field goal.\n\nBrandon McManus made the kick and extended Green Bay's lead to 19. The Dolphins now face a daunting comeback with just 5:17 left in regulation.\n\nJosh Jacobs breaks ankles on 49-yard catch-and-run\n\nJosh Jacobs caught a short dump-off from Jordan Love on a first-and-10 and did some great work after the catch. He made a gorgeous juke move that got a Dolphins defender out of position and dragged some defenders deep into Miami territory at the end of the play.\n\nThe Packers are now in field goal range and positioned to make this a three-score game. The catch was the longest of Jacobs' career to date.\n\nDolphins can't score from 1-yard line\n\nThe Dolphins got to the 1-yard line to set up a second-and-goal opportunity. On the ensuing three plays, De'Von Achane was stuffed for no gain, Keisean Nixon broke up a pass intended for Jonnu Smith and Tua Tagovailoa was sacked.\n\nAs a result, Miami turned the ball over on downs. Green Bay gets the ball back with 9:33 left leading by 16.\n\nLindsey Stirling closed out the NFL's Thanksgiving slate of halftime entertainment with her performance during the Green Bay Packers vs. Miami Dolphins game at Lambeau Field.\n\nViewers watching the contest at home were barely able to see the talented violinist and dancer in action.\n\nDolphins force Packers to punt\n\nWell, Miami has a chance to close in on Green Bay's lead.\n\nFollowing their touchdown, the Dolphins defense halted the Packers offense at midfield and forced a punt after a short, four-play, 17-yard drive.\n\nThe Dolphins get the ball back down two scores and the entire fourth quarter yet to play.\n\nPackers 27, Dolphins 11: Tua Tagovailoa, De'Von Achane connect for score\n\nNearly three full quarters of play into the game, Miami finally reached the end zone.\n\nA Tua Tagovailoa pass to De'Von Achane went for a 14-yard touchdown play. The Dolphins then converted the two-point conversion on a nice catch by Jaylen Waddle.\n\nOne of the key plays of the drive was a fourth-and-1 conversion at the Packers' 46-yard line that kept the drive alive. Two plays later, the Dolphins finally had their first touchdown of the game.\n\nPackers 27, Dolphins 3: Field goal extends lead\n\nBrandon McManus' second field goal - a 24-yard attempt - added to the Packers' growing lead after their first possession of the second half.\n\nA third-and-6 pass play from Jordan Love to Christian Watson went for 46 yards. The Packers followed up that play with a 15-yard play on a Love screen pass to Josh Jacobs.\n\nDiscouraging start to second half for Dolphins\n\nThe Dolphins came out of intermission desperately needing a spark after going down 24-3 at the end of the second quarter.\n\nInstead, Tua Tagovailoa and the offense went three-and-out after advancing just two yards. The Packers get the ball back with a chance to extend their lead.\n\nPackers 24, Dolphins 3: Brandon McManus extends Green Bay's lead before halftime\n\nAfter forcing the Dolphins into a turnover on downs, the Packers gained 34 yards on three plays to set up a 46-yard field goal attempt for Brandon McManus. He made it to extend Green Bay's lead to 24-3.\n\nThe Packers outgained the Dolphins 213-121 in the first half and forced two turnovers: one fumble and one on downs. Now, Tua Tagovailoa and Co. will have to play from behind in the cold. That could prove difficult considering the accuracy issues the quarterback is having throwing the ball 10-plus yards downfield in the freezing temperatures.\n\nDolphins fail to convert fourth down\n\nMike McDaniel opted to go for a fourth-and-5 from the Packers' 38-yard line instead of attending a field goal from 50-plus yards. Tua Tagovailoa overthrew his intended receiver De'Von Achane to give the ball back to the Packers with 22 seconds left in the half.\n\nGreen Bay has three timeouts remaining and could potentially get into field goal range.\n\nPackers 21, Dolphins 3: Jayden Reed catches second touchdown from Jordan Love\n\nThe Packers offense stays hot on a third-and-2. Jordan Love dumped a pass off to Jayden Reed and the second-year receiver wove his way through a few Dolphins receivers to log a 12-yard score.\n\nBrandon McManus converts the extra point to give the Packers a 21-3 lead with 1:36 left in the first half. Reed now has two catches thus far, both for touchdowns.\n\nLindsey Stirling will be the halftime entertainment during the Packers' Thanksgiving night game against the Dolphins.\n\nStirling is a 38-year-old violinist, dancer and song-writer began posting videos of her choreographed violin performances on YouTube in 2007. Her unique combination of talents landed her a spot on season five of \"America's Got Talent,\" where she made it to the quarterfinals before being knocked out of the competition.\n\nTua Tagovailoa sacked on back-to-back plays, Dolphins punt\n\nThe Dolphins' protection failed on back-to-back plays, which allowed Lukas Van Ness and Kingsley Enagbare to bring down Tua Tagovailoa. Miami's quarterback absorbed the big hits well, but Jake Bailey had to punt again.\n\nThe Packers get the ball back on their own 38-yard line with 3:03 left before halftime.\n\nDolphins stop Packers, force punt\n\nMiami follows up its first scoring drive by stopping Green Bay just after it got past midfield on a 23-yard Jayden Reed punt. This time, Malik Washington fields it cleanly. However, a holding penalty will back the Dolphins up significantly with 6:32 left until halftime.\n\nTua Tagovailoa stats\n\nThus far, Tua Tagovailoa hasn't shown any ill effects in the cold weather. He has completed 9-of-10 passes for 67 yards with his lone incompletion being a pass that was just low and in front of running back Raheem Mostert.\n\nTagovailoa hasn't taken many chances downfield yet, instead opting to throw underneath and let his playmakers generate yards after the catch, but that has been a staple of Miami's offense this year. If he can continue to play like this, the Dolphins will have a chance to move the ball against the Packers' defense.\n\nPackers 14, Dolphins 3: Jason Sanders makes 33-yard field goal\n\nThe Dolphins went backwards after getting a goal-to-go opportunity, so they had to settle for a 33-yard field goal. Jason Sanders made it with ease to get Miami on the board and cut Green Bay's lead to 14-3.\n\nDolphins convert fourth-and-4 after eschewing field goal\n\nThe Dolphins had a chance to attempt a 43-yard field goal but Mike McDaniel opted to go for it on fourth down instead. Tua Tagovailoa was given plenty of time in the pocket and was able to find Jaylen Waddle breaking wide open over the middle of the field for a first down.\n\nFirst and goal, Miami.\n\nPackers lead Dolphins 14-0 after first quarter\n\nGreen Bay has, predictably, jumped out to a fast start amid the freezing temperatures at Lambeau Field. They are playing physically on offense, racking up 50 yards and a touchdown on the ground, and capitalized on the one Miami turnover in the opening quarter.\n\nThat said, Tua Tagovailoa has started the game on a solid clip, completing 4-of-4 passes for 31 yards. He is taking what is given to him, but it will be interesting to see if he can continue to perform efficiently given his previous struggles in cold weather games.\n\nPackers 14, Dolphins 0: Josh Jacobs plunges in for 1-yard touchdown run\n\nThe Packers are imposing their will on the Dolphins early. Josh Jacobs got back-to-back carries in goal-to-go situations. On the first, he pushed a pile of Dolphins defenders 6 yards to get to the 1-yard line. On the next play, he punched it into the end zone.\n\nBrandon McManus converted on the extra point again to give the Packers a 14-0 lead. Green Bay has 50 rushing yards in the first quarter compared to negative-1 for Miami.\n\nKader Kohou injury update\n\nKader Kohou, a cornerback for the Dolphins, was injured attempting to catch a pass that deflected off receiver Dontayvion Wicks' hands. He was tended to by medical staff on the field and was seen reaching for his back before he went into the blue medical tent.\n\nThe Dolphins ruled Kohou \"questionable\" to return because of a back injury. He was also being reviewed for a potential concussion.\n\nMiami was already without normal starting cornerback Kendall Fuller on Thursday night.\n\nDolphins punt on first offensive possession after Jonnu Smith penalty\n\nMiami started the game by getting a first down after a couple of dump-offs to De'Von Achane, but they stalled out after that. Tua Tagovailoa took a sack and a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Jonnu Smith put the Dolphins in an unforgiving third-and-29 situation.\n\nJake Bailey punted it back to the Packers, who will look to improve upon their 7-0 lead on their third drive of the first quarter.\n\nCorey Ballentine injury update\n\nThe Packers have ruled Corey Ballentine, a backup defensive back and special teamer, questionable to return to Thursday's game after suffering a knee injury on the opening kickoff.\n\nBallentine has six tackles on the season in 10 games played (one start).\n\nPackers 7, Dolphins 0: Jayden Reed opens scoring with 3-yard touchdown catch\n\nThe Packers capitalize on the Dolphins' fumble. After two Josh Jacobs runs, Jordan Love found Jayden Reed breaking out toward the front pylon on an out route. The quarterback perfectly placed the ball in front of the receiver, preventing defensive back Storm Duck from knocking it down.\n\nBrandon McManus connects on the extra point to make it 7-0, Packers.\n\nDolphins fumble punt after Packers three-and-out setting up goal-to-go opportunity\n\nThe frigid temperatures in Green Bay are making an impact early on Thanksgiving. Jordan Love overthrew Jayden Reed for a potential big play on the Packers' first drive and as a result, they had to punt.\n\nMalik Washington couldn't field the punt and the Packers recovered the muff. That sets up a first-and-goal for the Packers.\n\nThe halftime entertainment has become a part of the NFL's Thanksgiving spectacle. Both the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys have landed quality performers in recent years, with Dolly Parton's performance at Dallas' 2023 game particularly capturing the interest of NFL and entertainment fans alike.\n\nThis year, the Cowboys are rolling with a country music star, Lainey Wilson, to entertain their crowd while the Lions landed Shaboozey, a versatile hip-hop and alt-country artist, to rock the Motor City.\n\nThe Packers went in a slightly different direction with their performer, landing someone known more for their instrumental abilities rather than their vocal prowess: Lindsey Stirling.\n\nWhy is Jason Garrett calling Packers vs. Dolphins?\n\nGarrett is serving as the color commentator for the Packers vs. Dolphins game in lieu of Cris Collinsworth, who presumably has the day off to celebrate Thanksgiving.\n\nAnd for those wondering why NBC is broadcasting the Thursday night game, the Thanksgiving night game rights are owned by NBC. As such, the network uses its \"Sunday Night Football\" branding and crew for the contest.\n\nPackers vs. Dolphins Thanksgiving game start time\n\nStart time : 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 PT)\n\n: 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 PT) Location: Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin\n\nThe NFL’s Thursday night games typically begin at 8:15 p.m. ET.

The program will begin at 7 p.m. ET and feature insight from a panel of analysts, including Maria Taylor, Jason Garrett, Chris Simms, Mike Florio, Devin McCourty, Tony Dungy, and more.\n\nPackers vs. Dolphins live stream\n\nLive stream: Fubo TV and Peacock\n\nFor cord cutters looking for a live stream for the matchup, you can turn to Fubo TV.

That ties them with the Chicago Bears for the third-most appearances on the holiday in NFL history and the most among teams that aren’t an every-year part of the Thanksgiving tradition.\n\nGreen Bay has a record of just 15-20-2 on the holiday. Below is a look at their seven most recent Thanksgiving appearances, which date back to 2001.\n\nNov. 23, 2023 : Packers 29, Lions 22\n\n: Packers 29, Lions 22 Nov. 26, 2015 : Bears 17, Packers 13\n\n: Bears 17, Packers 13 Nov. 28, 2013 : Lions 40, Packers 10\n\n: Lions 40, Packers 10 Nov. 24, 2011 : Packers 27, Lions 15\n\n: Packers 27, Lions 15 Nov. 22, 2007 : Packers 37, Lions 26\n\n: Packers 37, Lions 26 Nov. 27, 2003 : Lions 22, Packers 14\n\n: Lions 22, Packers 14 Nov. 22, 2001: Packers 29, Lions 27\n\nDolphins Thanksgiving history\n\nThe Dolphins have played on Thanksgiving seven times in their franchise's history. They have a 5-2 record in those games, with their most notable victory coming in a 16-14 victory over the Cowboys in the infamous 1993 game in which Leon Lett tried to recover a blocked field goal only for the Dolphins to recover the ball.\n\nBelow is a full look at Miami's Thanksgiving results:\n\nNov. 22, 1973 : Dolphins 14, Cowboys 7\n\n: Dolphins 14, Cowboys 7 Nov. 24, 1977 : Dolphins 55, St. Louis Cardinals 14\n\n: Dolphins 55, St. Louis Cardinals 14 Nov. 25, 1993 : Dolphins 16, Cowboys 14\n\n: Dolphins 16, Cowboys 14 Nov. 25, 1999 : Cowboys 20, Dolphins 0\n\n: Cowboys 20, Dolphins 0 Nov. 27, 2003 : Dolphins 40, Cowboys 21\n\n: Dolphins 40, Cowboys 21 Nov. 23, 2006 : Dolphins 27, Lions 10\n\n: Dolphins 27, Lions 10 Nov. 24, 2011: Cowboys 20, Dolphins 19\n\nThe NFL on Thanksgiving Day has featured some memorable moments, from Clint Longley leading a Cowboys comeback in 1974 and a national TV showcase for the incomparable Barry Sanders to the infamous Butt Fumble in 2012 and Leon Lett's blunder in 1993.\n\nNFL games on Thanksgiving have been a tradition since the league's inception in 1920 (there were six games that first season!). A third prime-time game was added in 2006, and includes teams other than the Lions and Cowboys, who each play their traditional Thanksgiving home games. — Jim Reineking\n\nJordan Love contract details\n\nJordan Love signed a four-year contract extension worth up to $220 million with the Packers during the 2024 NFL offseason. That gives him an average annual value (AAV) of $55 million, tied with Joe Burrow and Trevor Lawrence for the second-highest in the NFL behind Dak Prescott ($60 million).\n\nLove’s contract contains $160.3 million in guarantees, a significant investment by the Packers after his one year as a starter.\n\nTua Tagovailoa contract\n\nTua Tagovailoa was given a lucrative contract during the 2024 NFL offseason as well. He got a four-year deal worth up to $212.4 million. His AAV of $53.1 million is the fifth-highest in the NFL, but he earned the ninth-most guaranteed money for a quarterback as part of his deal ($167.17 million).\n\nLove and Tagovailoa have fairly similar contracts, all things considered, so it will be interesting to see the two face off against one another.\n\nWhich NFL team has the most Super Bowl wins?\n\nThe New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six.\n\nPittsburgh and Dallas have the unique distinction of playing each other more than any other team combination in Super Bowl history with three matchups.\n\nThe Packers own four Super Bowl wins, most recently during the 2010 season, when the defeated the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.
